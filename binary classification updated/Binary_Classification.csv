Jody Malsbury,Functional,I used to love the app and don't mind ads (ugh) if they keep the app free. But for the last week both the GPS and distance have been acting screwy. 2 weeks now. GPS signal is strong and app is in foreground; my use has not changed in the way I've been using it in the past 9 months. Same routes I've been walking for 7 months are showing weirdly different results.,1.0
Stephen A. Vrismo,Functional,"Once again, this app has failed. Most recently, it showed no movement from my starting point, and yet the final report showed that I'd moved over one mile. In reality, the route was actually less than half of that. I've had other frustrating experiences, but they're all basically the same. It doesn't always track my movement (GPS feature). It either over-counts my movement or under-counts it. When it does that it is wildly inaccurate. By comparison Google Maps accurately maps my walking route.",1.0
Jane Font,Functional,"This app used to be good, but now you're bombarded with ads. I've always used the GPS tracking feature, but now whenever I turn it on, it automatically give me some random amount of distance before I've even taken a step anywhere from 0.01 mi to 0.25 mi. It's really frustrating and I'm don't trust that any of the info is accurate now.",1.0
Michael StÃ¥hl,Functional,Training function miscalculate both steps and distance making them 5 times larger. It should at least verify the measurement with the normal step counter. Also it's impossible to access the GPS route after you have saved the training session. Edit: Keeping the app in the foreground makes it pointless since the user would also listen to music and such at the same time. You need to instead improve it to handle working from the background. And GPS coverage was good in the middle of the metropolis.,1.0
Sue Chadwick,Functional,"Never previously had a problem and I only use as a simple step and distance counter. Haven't checked for a few weeks until today. I can see there have been changes. I'm not sure how I need to use it now. I never did anything but carry it around with me before but it's now useless for me. It recorded 101 steps in one direction but by the return it had recorded just under 3k; both wildly under reported. I'm carrying the phone exactly as I've always done. Time to find another app, I think.",1.0
Jerry,Functional,"Your app states 3rd party tracking not permitted. In the 2 hours this app has been active there has been 6950 tracking attempts, by Google, on my cell phone. I guess your definition of no tracking and mine are different. If this tracking continues I will be shutting it down, permanently. I have submitted the screenshot you requested again. The answer provided via E-Mail was not satisfactory. I am removing your step counter from my device. My privacy is far more important than having a counter.",1.0
Mike Carroll,Functional,I've used this app last year and was great. Now for this multi-day hike. It is off my 2 - 3 hours and Kms off by 6- 10. I use 3 other apps they all work. Paper map and Google have the Kms so I knows it's right. I've put the sensitivity to the highest you can get. It's still wrong.,1.0
EnchantedxPassion xo,Functional,It stopped being accurate with the steps after last update. Lags far behind. It made me lose thousands of steps. I wish I never updated it in early October.,1.0
K'mecko Kay,Functional,"Today I walked, with my phone in my back pocket for 1hr 30 mins. When I got home, I check this tracker and it read 0 steps for the entire day. The water intake reads 8 oz when I entered 24 oz.",1.0
peter flanagan,Functional,"Used to be a really good, reliable app. Now it's wrong on distance every time, and often on route and/or GPS. Totally useless if distance is more important to you than total steps. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times to no avail. Uninstalling for good now. Updated 22nd May '23..... Reinstalled to see if app had been fixed.....Not at all!! As bad as ever! Total waste of time.",1.0
EML,Functional,"Useless for either step or GPS tracking. On one route I take it has shown 11.11, 10.71, 10.85, and 10.91 miles, with 21886, 27413, 29311, and 35322 steps respectively. The main problem is that there's no filtering at all on the GPS signal, so it overestimates distance, and also shows you moving when you're stationary. I paused it yesterday, stopped for 20 minutes, and when it restarted it said that I had gone 1.2 miles since pausing. There are several more more minor problems.",1.0
Rob Rolls,Functional,"ZERO STARS, and if I could give less than zero stars, I would. - AVOID THIS APP - Distances are wildly inaccurate, steps counted are wrong, the audio keeps working even if you turn disable it and turn off your device speakers, and when you close the app, it restarts itself (Force Stop in Settings kills it). Nothing works properly and after a year reporting the problems then giving it another chance, I give up. They've fixed nothing and it isn't worth it's free price. Avoid it like the plague.",1.0
Bharat Shah,Functional,"This app is unreliable; It is absolutely untrustworthy since it stops working abruptly. Initially it worked well, but then it started behaving erratically. I have noticed that the app counts each step accurately if I keep the phone unlocked in front of me in hand (like reading something,) but it sleeps if I lock and keep it in the back pocket. There are times when it works extremely well no matter in whichever pocket I keep it. In short, you cannot rely on this app.",1.0
David Hadwin,Functional,"Couldn't get it to work. Setup demands, and aggressively so, that I allow all sorts of access that isn't even possible on my phone.",1.0
Kenny Dellinger,Functional,"This app is horrible! It shows you the ranking of others steps and shows you where you're ranked. Problem is, every morning by 8am, it shows that multiple people have put in 40,000-80,000 steps! There is no way that somebody has walked or jogged 20-40 miles by 8am, and it's multiple! It used to be accurate, but all the sudden started showing extremely high counts for people.",1.0
E Caron-Graham,Functional,"06/18/23 update: GPS signal not weak, as you have stated. Worked FINE on my Motorola for two years. I have checked & reconfigured all phone settings. Still not working. 0.04 miles when I clearly walked 1.6 miles??? REALLY??? Y'all have to do better than that.Since the updates of the last three days, it continues to malfunction.",1.0
Mike Doyle,Functional,"Despite your replies on previous comments I've seen, if you turn off all the voice buttons in settings she STILL talks! UPDATE: after 2 years I reinstalled because I thought it must be sorted by now. Nope: 5mins after you start a robot voice will tell you how proud of you they are 'because you're developing healthy habits'. Might work for some but I find it to be patronising guff. And that's with all voice options off! UPDATE 2: whoever is doing the feedback needs to read this review properly.",1.0
Teresa Trimm,Functional,"So far, it has aligned itself to my actual walk...ONCE. The first time I used it on a short walk to the park, it worked great. Hasn't since. It seems to get the mileage right, but the route that I walk isn't even close. I even paid to get rid of the ads!!",1.0
Paul,Functional,"Worst tracker I've ever used. Continually pauses itself so when you remember to check it part way through a walk it asks if you want to resume your workout. Other than carrying it in front of your face you don't know when it has paused. I just did a verified 6.2 mile walk and it registered 1.27 miles. I resumed it several times or it would still be at 0. Total rubbish, I had the problem yesterday but gave it another shot today, waste of space, deleting.",1.0
Louis Le (ToastyDonuts),Functional,"Everything is decent but need at option to set time and distance (not just distance) and an auto stop when you have reached set time limit or distance. Update: lost 1 star becuse everyday every time i start at 1 exact location, my distance which i set for 2 miles ends in different points of the run. Sometimes i end farther sometimes i end sooner. Its not by much as far as distance goes but step wise im doing an extra 200 steps. Update: unistalled. Too inconsistent",1.0
Silvia Feldman,Functional,This application doesn't count steps correctly as compared with my Fitbit Charger 2. It's is off by more than 1/3. In my case about 2000 steps and can't be edited. Unacceptable. Started looking for another app.,1.0
A Google user,Functional,Dtay away from this app! The app never turned off even when I would tell it to even when I would manually shut it off it would just turn itself back on sometime during the night. There was no way to stop notifications either. I would turn notifications off it would turn themselves back on. As soon as I downloaded this app I started having all kinds of malware issues and my phone started acting as if it was bugged.,1.0
Harsha Singh,Functional,"The steps count, calorie calculation and GPS are all inaccurate. The app automatically stops during the walk/run. One needs to keep checking it which is very frustrating. Even after constantly checking the app and being on the same route throughout it still calculates the distance inaccurately and hence steps , calories etc. The steps count are different as shown on the home page and in the training history tab.",1.0
Hugh James,Functional,"Worked well and was quite accurate when measured against Garmin Vivofit. A problem has developed if I use GPS and pause it then a few minutes later when I resume extra miles have been added. The other day I paused the app when going indoors for 10 minutes and only moved a few yards, instead of restarting at 5 miles it showed 8 miles, I had not done 3 miles indoors in 10 minutes. I know from regular walking the distance is 5 miles. History is selective only a few episodes are able to be deleted.",1.0
John Connor,Functional,"Works great, but I turned off all voice prompt and it still prompts me for training paused, training resumed, keep it up your halfway there, the sound of people cheering when I finish. Fix this bug and it would be 5 stars but right now it's unusable because I can't turn off the audio even though I turned it all off.",1.0
Dave Black,Functional,"Maybe the app is not compatible with my phone (Huawei Y6), timings are nowhere near accurate, states walking 16 minutes - actual was 47 minutes (happened many times with different amounts). Number of steps also inaccurate, states 187, even though I've walked about 2 miles. Turned on the GPS, it told me that I'd walked about half a mile from where I'd actually gone, it got the total distance wrong, and the time taken. Tried uninstall, clearing cache, background running etc still don't work right.",1.0
Karin Face Yoga,Functional,"Answer: (Google, please change how to answer!) I use the app several years now and I don't have the POP. No idea with which account I bought it. No problem. Going for another one. Not going to buy this again. I always have it 5 stars. I even bought the pro version. Now I've changed cell phones and the sync doesn't work. I have the version with adds and no level 9 anymore. Have to start all over.",1.0
Peachie Dude,Functional,"Why one star? You can't rely on this app distance. Why? When walking, overview will show a distance, ok. Stand still, the distance will keep changing even if you're not moving. Funny eh?! Go to history and go to distance tab, it will show a different distance too. Used in 2 different devices and it shows the same.. i thought about paying and so but I noticed it.. I won't spend on a deceiving app. Start it and leave your phone on the table.. distance will change. Stupid app.",1.0
Kylie Felix,Functional,"""Gender"" doesn't actually tell you stride lengths like they suggest. Maybe another very common, easy to obtain piece of information could be more accurate (and inclusive)... say, maybe.. height...? ðŸ™„ Seeing this as the first thing opening the app tells me immediately that this app is going to be gimicky and unscientific since they can't even be bothered to know the difference between gender and sex, nor how to effectively use sex-based statistics.",1.0
Bear From Mars,Functional,"The interface is simple enough, however the apps inaccuracy is frustrating. Often it will stop mid walk for no apparent reason and I'll only find out when I get home and go to stop the app, only for it to ask me do I wish to resume exercise. Also, even though I walk the EXACT same route every day which is exactly 3.25 miles... when the app does measure my full walk, the distance measured varies between 2.8 & 3.6 miles. Also, it seems to continue adding distance even if I stop for a few minutes.",1.0
Ainsley Goodwin,Functional,"Loved this app up until a point. No matter what I do I can not turn that countdown voice off, despite playing with the settings. Also most recently I had to factory reset my phone. I had almost reached the goal of walking to Paris but when I restored my phone none of the info that was backed up synced over. This was incredibly devastating, I lost over a months worth of work, I walk dogs daily as my job and I lost all records of them. I'd change to 5 stars if either of my problems were resolved.",1.0
Geronimo,Functional,"Had this app for a few months , It is so stupd , cant to back and see ANY progress i ever did , ITS TO CO?FUSING , DELETING AND UNINSTALLING . TOTALLY DUMB APP",1.0
Erik Erikson,Functional,Don't bother! This app is useless. 1st day I used this I stopped to take a few pictures of a light house. The app recorded the photos as miles and also showed my route as going out over the water and back in the direction of my photos. Today I went out again and did not take photos and it added 3 extra miles and showed me on routes I did not take. Ita seems if I took my phone out of my pocket it some how picks up distance where I am pointing my phone. Terrible app!,1.0
Manuel B.,Functional,"Every time I start the app for the first time on any given day or time, it calculates some crazy distances, ie 300 steps being 500 metres and growing. Have to stop the app, go through the ads and press backs, close and restart the app, only then it starts working properly. Annoying AF. And the ""celebration"" ahhs and ohhs are even more annoying. One star because I can't give zero.",1.0
Nethra S,Functional,"The app abruptly stops tracking the steps. It has happened on many occassions. This is definitely an issue because I would have set a target and would be walking towards it, when I check my phone in between to see how much of my target I have completed it would prompt me to resume my workout although I had been walking all the while. This is a totally useless app.",1.0
Anton ANDRIJANIC,Functional,"The distance tracker is useless, on a 20km run it tells me 16.4km. The rest of the app is perfect. I train over 10 people and have encouraged all to download it but after 3 weeks have discovered how inaccurate it is. Running 20 but being told 16.4 is super inaccurate. Everything thing else seems ok but I am going to have to switch to another app. I've sent over 20 emails about this btw. Be nice to get a response for once",1.0
James Freeman,Functional,"I wanted to love this app so much. The interface is lovely. And then I went for my first walk with it yesterday... And the app measured my two mile walk as being 9.1 miles on the GPS (I have a Moto G9 plus and other GPS tracking apps work a-okay)... So I've had to delete it as it just doesn't work properly. I wish the developers luck with working out the bugs, because the interface really is great. But it's not working on a Moto g9 plus.",1.0
Hatakishore Behera,Functional,"I walked out for 58 min, but it shows as 33 min. I walked more than 3.5 km but it shows 1.27 km. Steps are also wrong. For the same round inside a park, sometimes it shows as 620 steps other times it shows the same distance as 380 steps. While i was walking with a constant speed with mobile in my hand. Worst experience.",1.0
Karen Letten,Functional,"It's ok to use. I like how it automatically counts your steps. The issue for me is that the times and length of walks are wildly out which is really disappointing - can you please sort this out as or would be fantastic otherwise. Update I have deleted the app, been for a 2 hour walk today, app said I had walked 47 km........ Walked no more than 5km, completely inaccurate",1.0
Troy Egan,Functional,"Not great. Tge different sensitivity settings didn't seem to make a difference in how the steps accumulated. Also i accumulated steps when my phone was just sitting idle on the bench, sometimes over 500 steps. Seems pretty flawed. I really enjoyed the concept of benchmarks it made tge app feel like a game. However the app was unreliable.",1.0
G Mar,Functional,"""Simple"", my derriere. You have to go through half a dozen utterly useless ""encouraging"" screens and trainer voice offers and other garbage to simply read the damn number of steps. It doesn't even seem to work in the background, you always have to activate it and spend minutes fiddling with those pointless screens to get the only thing this should serve: the step count. Uninstalled and sent to oblivion.",1.0
Tarang Menon,Functional,"Completely inaccurate app, I realized this when I took a break from my run and saw that the tracker was automatically increasing the distance covered when I was sitting. Pls use other apps. This app is computerized to cover the distances of an average man running and does not really track our actual activity. It just uses and consumes the internet and gps for nothing.",1.0
Gary Broadhurst,Functional,The app. Isn't accurate - it underestimates the distance I walk by more than 30%! This is for walks I do regularly and know the distance. Other apps. work so it's not my phone at fault. It runs smoothly and reliably and I like the features but it's useless if it isn't accurate.,1.0
yatin amin,Functional,I recorded two trek routes with gps in on position. Path of route in both treks was not recorded as per trek but it showed only straight line even though there were many turns & bends on route. This is totally wrong recording. Distance trekked was wrongly showing 26 km in place of 4.1 km in one route & 20 km in place of 3.8 km. Request for necessary correction please. Thank you.,1.0
Derry Wootton,Functional,"Has stopped tracking when phone is locked - so you get a straight line on the map when you unlock the phone. Also get ""GPS is disabled"" when trying to view routes in history - can't then review where I've been. The latter has been like that for ages, the former only this past week or so. Checked on solutions online - don't work.",1.0
S N,Functional,It does not count the steps. At all. .I had given 4 stars but now have reduced it. I walked about 1 km and then found out the app had shut itself down and didn't count a single step. And I have given 2 feedbacks as well. So tired of it. Edit: had to unfortunately uninstall it as problem kept persisting. Cannot meet my daily walk requirements despite walking and walking as the app shuts itself without warning and does not count steps.,1.0
Kat,Functional,"DON'T waste your time. First two times of using it, it was ok. Since then, no accuracy without without the GPS. Example: you walk 2km and it says you've walked 700metres and step count is way off too. Going to look for a better app. One that doesn't claim to be the most accurate and isn't.",1.0
Kimbo__86,Functional,"Huwawei p smart. Turned it on when I left the house. Checked when I got home and I had a message saying it forced stopped and did I want to resume? Checked again and when the screen locks the app stops. Bit pointless as I don't want my screen on in my pocket wasting battery. Checked multiple times and happened every time. Uninstalled. Also, it absolutely sucks the life out of your battery.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"No good. Won't track route unless you keep stopping at every turn to check it on the map. If you don't, it will just draw a straight line between points and calculate that distance. Also, keeps opening up YouTube while I was walking. Uninstalled",1.0
Deborah G,Functional,"Very inaccurate! I think it counted my steps and calories well enough, but distance and gps tracking were WAY off. It calculated my 3.5 mile walks as 2.4-2.8 miles. Then I tried using the GPS route tracker hoping it would be more accurate, it was completely wrong. I walked my 3 1/2 mile walk on a bike path and then it showed me having walked a route through the streets of an adjacent neighborhood...lol! I didn't go anywhere it said I did. PLUS it stopped calculating my distance at one mile.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Stay away from this app. This app initially showed promise. But after walking the exact same track for 5 days using the GPS tracker, the distance recorded varied from 7.6 km to 10.08 km. Go figure. Than on day 7 the GPS tracking option just wouldn't work. I'm looking for an alternative app.",1.0
Rachel Goldsmith,Functional,"Great app in theory. Unfortunately it doesn't track your mileage accurately. Yesterday it only recorded half of a 6 mile walk. Day before, the same. I did the 'how to fix' button but it didn't work. Not fit for purpose.",1.0
Jenny N,Functional,It's not accurate. I have 2 devices with same app and I carried both for same distance and trust me both have showed different steps count . I tried 10 times n all the time both the devices showed different steps count. So I m uninstalling the app. Thank You,1.0
Chris Jay,Functional,"I love this app apart from one huge major flaw. This app cannot calculate distance correctly. I've tried it for 2 days now on my regular walking route which is 5.3km exactly. The first day I used this app it told me I had travelled 7.8km. And the second day it told me 9.9km ðŸ˜ . Such a shame as it seemed so promising , but If you can't calculate kilometres properly then how can you trust any of the other information the app is calculating!!!!!",1.0
Daniela Duerksen,Functional,"On random days the steps are not counted at all. Used this app 7 days, and 2 of those days it didn't count even after going for a 8k+ step walk. After restarting my phone entirely it started to count my steps. Seems like when you go for a longer walk it counts fine, but noticed that the step count for regular walking in between is way off (usually in my work shift I will get a minimum of 2k steps in, this app counted less then 300 steps).",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"No map coverage also map at start picks last location but then map disappears so I believe that accuracy is 10 percent. Really bad without map no one will know unless you have two apps installed. Serious problem also app turns off while walking even w.ith all permissions set to high, all notifications on. GPS on continuously app has problems",1.0
TJ Lee,Functional,"Update: issue still ongoing and developer has never responded. Don't use this app, it doesn't work properly and there's no support from the developer! The app isn't recording steps when on at times. I'll be walking and it will stop counting steps for between a couple minutes to 15 minutes or more. This is happening pretty much daily.",1.0
Mohan Krishna Palaveri Chakravarthy,Functional,"Became Obsolete. It was good and lately is not working properly. It is not counting the steps and you have to choose that training thing for the steps to count.It is pausing and exiting itself. Uninstalling. Try to fix the bugs guys, thank you,,.",1.0
Larry Buhay,Functional,"I used this app for 5 days. I walk the same circuit, but the app reported distances from 3 to 7 miles. My last day it crashed a couple of times and it seems to have a conflict with my music app. I reviewing as I delete it.",1.0
Yeshua Catherineka,Functional,"It was working fine in the beginning. Later it started skipping on distance goal, how can I walk 2 km in 5 minutes. Tells wrongly about pace, and calories. I reinstalled it , the problem has gone worse. Kindly fix it. So I don't have to uninstall.",1.0
Demetriss Miller,Functional,I've sent several emails. I walk the same 5mile route every morning. The last 4 days the app is not even measuring a mile. I edit it and today tried to delete the incorrect ones and it deleted the ones i edited . I cant figure out how to get them back. I am gonna have to find another app. I really want this info and I delete another app thinking this one was better,1.0
Mary Loller,Functional,"Everything about this app used to work great for me. Since the update (Aug 2020), the GPS is way off. It looks like I'm zigzagging all over, going thru people's yards, etc. The miles are now way off. It showed 3.5 mi when I know I only walked about 2.3 mi. Because the miles are off, my time is off, showing a 13 min mile when it was closer to 18 min. I know this because it's the same route I walk daily. This is not acceptable.",1.0
Javier Rivera,Functional,"It's a good idea of an app, but horribly inaccurate. I use 2 phones and have the same issue... have a pre-designated area of 2.4 miles and another area of 4.6 miles... one day it says I walked .8 miles on the 2.4 miles route and today just finished walking the 4.6 miles route and it only logged 2.8 miles!!! Awful awful!!!",1.0

G J,Functional,"Used the app about 2 months. Liked it. Went with paid version. ""Mapping"" stopped working and distance became unreliable. Worst of all, I asked for help from the seller almost 3 weeks ago, and haven't gotten a response. (System info(App v1.3.3(48)A, Model SM-G950U, OS v9)",1.0

Michael StÃ¥hl,Functional,Training function miscalculate both steps and distance making them 5 times larger. It should at least verify the measurement with the normal step counter. Also it's impossible to access the GPS route after you have saved the training session.

Michael Drumheller,Functional,I had the same problem as some other described in their reviews. It said I walked 2 Miles in 1hr 38mins and I had only walked a mile. Not accurate at all.,1.0
Drew Picone,Functional,This app is incredibly inaccurate and it continues to add distance when you're not even moving(probably to make people think they've done something.),1.0

Mike Doyle,Functional,"Despite your replies on previous comments I've seen, if you turn off all the voice buttons in settings she STILL talks! UPDATE: after 2 years I reinstalled because I thought it must be sorted by now. Nope: 5mins after you start a robot voice will tell you how proud of you they are 'because you're developing healthy habits'. Might work for some but I find it to be patronising guff. And that's with all voice options off! UPDATE 2: whoever is doing the feedback needs to read this review properly.",1.0
Neil Whiting,Functional,It tells you how long you have walked but the GPS doesn't work despite perfect signal so you can not get an accurate account of how far you have walked rendering the app pointless.,1.0
Jody Malsbury,Functional,I used to love the app and don't mind ads (ugh) if they keep the app free. But for the last week both the GPS and distance have been acting screwy. 2 weeks now. GPS signal is strong and app is in foreground; my use has not changed in the way I've been using it in the past 9 months. Same routes I've been walking for 7 months are showing weirdly different results.,1.0
Kylie Felix,Functional,"""Gender"" doesn't actually tell you stride lengths like they suggest. Maybe another very common, easy to obtain piece of information could be more accurate (and inclusive)... say, maybe.. height...? ðŸ™„ Seeing this as the first thing opening the app tells me immediately that this app is going to be gimicky and unscientific since they can't even be bothered to know the difference between gender and sex, nor how to effectively use sex-based statistics.",1.0
Prince Chhetri,Functional,This app was running smoothly at first but now it doesn't count any step and shows all those blank step when i open this app and now matter how many times i tried to fix this its not working it seems like its a scam nowadays,1.0
James Ayube,Functional,"I used to love this app, but the ads have become very obtrusive the last few months, so I'll be switching to another pedometer app. It's a shame they had to ruin the experience I undestand the need for apps on a free app, however I don't understand the need to have ads explode over the app when you open or when you try to exit. A more subtle ad makes it a lot more likely for me, at least, to look at at an ad, versus now it gives me a negative view of the product",1.0
Angel Mercy C,Functional,"Worst app.step counted properly for 3 to ,4 days after that it doesn't count",1.0
P B,Functional,It was really good app before recent updates. You can walk all day on Tuesday and the app shows 0 steps just to show you 9000 steps on Wednesday morning while you're still in bed. I'm not a sleepwalker lol. Useless.,1.0

Forest Frost,Functional,"I've downloaded this app several times on four different phones and two different carriers. The first time, it worked great, and I was very happy with how it worked. The second time, my history didn't transfer, so I just started from zero again. Later, the app started acting weird and gave me a lot of advertising in Russian. Since I changed carrier it hasn't worked at all. It only records a few points along a 4 mile hike, or says I walk 5 miles in 17 seconds. I'm looking for a new app.",2.0
Angela Guillory,Functional,"There's two issues I can't get past: 1) The app gives audio feedback. I have turned that off, yet I still get an audible countdown when the app begins, when I'm halfway to my step goal and when I reach the goal. I listen to podcasts while I walk. The audio plays over which causes me to have to rewind. 2) I often forget to end my tracking once I come back home which means the timer continues to run. You can override the number of steps, but not the time. I did pay for the full version.",2.0
Cameron Michael,Functional,"I had the app for exactly one year, 365 days before uninstalling. I used it only for tracking my steps. It counted in intervals of ten not individually, so it wasn't always accurate. It also used to be ad-free. They've begun to add ads gradually. First only when you open the app, but now more and more common to see. I tolerated the app for a year, but have uninstalled because of these two reasons. There are better free step trackers out there. :)",2.0
Henry Logue,Functional,"This is an updated review. The app is great and dependable and does exactly what it's supposed to do (walk, run, or drive). It keeps it's end up. However, I've contacted support twice and the problems persists. They responded once but didn't fix the issues. If you don't respond I'm giving one â",2.0
A Google user,Functional,App is easy to use and the voice updates while walking and/or running are great. Steps tracked and distance are accurate but only during workout. This app has a huge flaw. All the data it appears to collect accurately while working out changes after I exit and return to the app to look at my stats. Example: I did just over 3 miles with nearly 8000 steps. When I came back to check the workout I lost at least a 1/4 mile and nearly 2500 steps. This happens every time.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I want to rate this higher, but it seems to have a bug. It WONT TURN OFF! To save on my battery power, I only want it on when I am tracking my steps. The problem is, when I click on ""turn off"" it does nothing. When I click on ""pause"", it will pause and then turn back on. This is very annoying! I like the other features, but this is enough to make me remove it from my phone.",2.0
Michael Netherton,Functional,"This is a good app in theory, but in practice it leaves a lot to be desired. First are the sounds. They are annoying and irritating. There is no way to turn them off. Next is the lack of accuracy with gps tracking data. Many times it shows me walking through yards, fences and houses in my subdivision. My biggest complaint is the inability to export my data. I've asked for help but never received any help. I have close to 1,000 miles racked up but use another app now to track my walking/running.",2.0
Barbara Guthrie,Functional,"My number one problem is when it stops Counting, and my number two problem is that once you get into the map mode or whatever you can't get back into the main screen without ending the training session and it really pisses me off.

Naomi Howard,Functional,"18 Oct was the last time I used this app with satisfaction. Since then, the GPS function no longer works even with Location turned on. I am no longer able to get a map of my route during my walk, nor after I've completed it. My distance walked is no longer accurate. The discrepancies increase the farther I go. I've sent feedback emails more than once since this started, but I've not received any response. Please fix these new issues. Thx",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"This is one of the best designed apps that had I used (great UI). unfortunately, I had to reset it twice because it kept and doubling or more my distance that I walked.

D M,Functional,"Used this for years to track walks. Was really accurate with location (gps only). Last month or so my distances are off by up to 20%.

So, I deleted the app. If it had been wrong by a consistent ratio i might have kept using it and just done some math, but it wasn't.",2.0
RR Splinter,Functional,"It doesn't work properly. It stops counting. It stopped counting the very first day I downloaded it! It has not performed whatsoever. By the way....the app IS in the foreground. It is running, it just doesn't pick up. Those things ARE being done....",2.0
Arthur Snelling,Functional,Good at first....now there are HORRIBLE full page adverts (with sound) to negotiate before you get to the app. A complete PITA. I also find it inaccurate. If I walk the same route in reverse the GPS always show a different distance - by as much as half a mile!,2.0
Clint Ennen,Functional,I'd give it a 5-star review if the GPS wasn't always inaccurate when you first turn the app on. It can really screw up your record-keeping if you're not paying attention it'll add a half a mile or whatever it is until the app catches up. You think the developers would have the GPS refresh as soon as you open the app. But nope. I've reported the issue to the developers and they ignore me.,2.0
Rich Denton,Functional,The Step Tracker Apps time and steps are accurate but the miles are way off!!! The route I walk is 3.3 miles. The app shows anywhere from 0.90 to 4.09 miles (mostly on the low side). The apps routing diagram shows the exact route that I've walked.so the GPS part is working correctly. My cell phone is an android version 6.0. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the inaccurate miles.,2.0
Liberty Warrior,Functional,"Used to be accurate the first few times I used it, but the more I used it, the more inaccurate it became . Doesn't keep accurate distance, or map my route properly. Stops Counting miles traveled. Always shorts me as of late 1.25 to 2 miles at least. The longer distance I walk, the greater the discrepancy. Walking a known distance of 6 Mi and only counting four of them. Highly inaccurate. The pedometer and timer seem to consistently work accurately.",2.0
Larry Schmitt,Functional,"Overall this is a pretty good app, but I've had a couple problems with it. First is, if I finish walking but forget to stop the app, it continues to add distance to my walk even if I'm not moving. Then today it did something unique. It showed me walking 4,785 miles in a bit over two hours. That works out to over Mach 3. The map shows me walking to London, Ontario (across Lake Erie, no less), and back, then up to Montreal and back, with a couple side trips to the south and east.",2.0
Elizabeth Hunt,Functional,It keeps jumping distance or stops counting calories one day and distance the next. One day it just started from where I'd stopped it the day before. Very unreliable as I walk roughly the same route every day yet get a different count every time. Why? I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing seems to work. One day it's fine and the next it's all over the place. Want to use it as it's the only tracker I've found that announces the info without having to keep checking it,2.0
Kevin Simpson,Functional,"I installed this app earlier today hoping it would be a replacement to the Samsung Health app I had on my previous phone. Not even close. The idea is good but I cannot give it a good rating because the miles verses steps is WAYYYYYYYYY off!!! It shows just under 7k steps, but over 7 miles of walking!

Sarah Chambers,Functional,"Good for pedometer, but nothing else. I tried to track the distance of the same walk, three nights in a row.

Ian Johnson,Functional,"Looks good and has a lot of features for a free app, I did like the GPS tracker but it falls down on it's basic feature, it doesn't count accurately and often just stops counting. You can edit the steps to add them back in but that is just guess work.",2.0
Douglas Thomson,Functional,"Poor quality. Regularly pauses without warning, on occasions for distances of several miles, which makes monitoring extremely difficult.

A.J.,Functional,"This Step Tracker would lose track of everything! I'd be walking the same track repeatedly (this track was laid to be exactly 1/4 mile) & all of a sudden the pedometer & odometer would say I was hardly taking any steps & I'd only walked .03 or .o6 on a .25ml lap! It'd do the same with other types of walks & app features. I'm disappointed in this app. I loved the features when they worked, a few weeks at most after downloading. I tried it two times, & it kept developing the same issues. NOT GOOD!",2.0
Funny Guy,Functional,It's giving wrong information all together now. Wrong distance covered. It's becoming really annoying now to hope and track my progress only to know in the end that this app calculated your distance covered wrong. For example today I walked maybe 3 to 4km max. But the app shows distance covered 13km and step count 4k. This is been happening for a month now.,2.0
Priscilla Russell,Functional,It was working fine until today. When I went to open the app it stayed open for a second or two and then shut down. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but same thing happened. Very annoying as it won't list distance any more only he steps and now I've lost all my previous workout records.,2.0
F,Functional,"The app would be great if it alllowed for an automatic mode that started counting as soon as I start moving.

Murdoch Gillespie,Functional,"When I first downloaded this app it worked perfectly. However, since a recent update it is totally erratic and misrepresents the distance travelled.

It is almost as if it is calculating miles but expressing those miles as kilometres.",2.0
J M,Functional,"I got a new cell phone in December 2021 and the app seemed to work just fine. However, the last few times I've used it I noticed that it wasn't tracking me correctly (i.e. time exercised, calories burned, distance). Idk if it had to do with my new Samsung Galaxy watch I attached to my phone. It doesn't make sense why this happened. I've had issues off and on with the app, removed it the app a few times and even did updates. I've just decided to remove it from my phone all together.",2.0
Diane Benfell,Functional,Started OK but stopped counting for both of us. Trying out again as it looks clear but will uninstall if it stops again on me.

I have tried closing and opening the app, it doesnt work, well it works for few steps and stops again. So have to restart my phone Another issue I have found recently is that it has started to calculate less steps. On a route that normally is 3200 steps (I counted manually) it now shows 2400. Also for 10k steps initially calories were approx 500 now it is approx. 400",2.0
George Price,Functional,On the grand scheme of things it did not I repeat did not track my steps accurately. I turned the GPS tracker it went out for a walk. The path I take is roughly a little over 2 mi. It only tracked a mile and a half of it and not even the path I took was shown on the GPS mapping. This app is useless if you're trying to get an accurate count and map of a distance traveled.,2.0
Mark Shernicoff,Functional,I've been downgraded my rating 5 to 2 because I reported this problem about a week ago and haven't gotten a response. Something happened to the app recently and the GPS tracking is not working properly. It stops tracking at about 0.16 mile and then shows a straight line back to the stopping point which in my case is the starting point. The step count is about right and represents a walk of about a half mile. Hopefully this will generate a response and fix.,2.0
Scratch Zea,Functional,"Measures my steps when I spin my phone, measures the distance walked inaccurately consistently (not just once) and the app is full of ads, even when using the most basic functions.

Kristin Walker (Google User),Functional,"The step counter and timer is accurate.

Ashutosh Pandey,Functional,"I liked the app, akd paid for it. Now I find that it gives wildly wrong distance covered.

Julie Harrison,Functional,Update: Developer says use Fix in Profile. There is no Fix within Profile only Google Back Up and Restore which I did. You can see when you walk that it's missing out counting all steps (say) it counts 2 steps for 5 actual steps so it is only registering about a third of what you've actually walked.

Today I walked the usual journey to and from work, takes 1hrs 15 to 1hrs 20 mins and usually approx 11k steps, today it recorded less than 1hr walking and less than 8k steps! I really don't trust the accuracy so I'm deleting and buying a health watch.",2.0

Peter Lewis,Functional,"No longer counting steps accurately. Used to work well but missed thousands of steps yesterday as well as the stairs I climbed a few minutes ago. I hadn't used it for a few weeks so I'm not sure when this happened, maybe since the recent update? I have increased the sensitivity to maximum but this has not helped.",2.0
Ken TheGreatman,Functional,"The app seems ok at first but it tends to take over your phone. There doesn't appear to be a way to make it dormant. The big thing was that after I had walked 4.5 km and 4000+ steps in the morning, I drove my car in the evening. When I got home the phone said I had walked 50km and done 7300 steps. There was nothing obvious in the settings to resolve this. Of course I uninstalled it in less than one day.",2.0
Paul Casqueira,Functional,"What is going on with this app lately!? For the past month or more the stats are way off. Distance is always off by about 30-40 % and speed way off as well (there is no way I'm riding at over 90 km/h). I've tried looking at all settings and nothing seems to work. Good app otherwise, but if this continues for much longer, I'll have to uninstall it and try a different one. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for this problem. Very frustrating.",2.0
Vanessa Paul,Functional,This app keeps stopping or won't start counting and then when it does it's forever not adding my steps when I know my step routine and does not count 1000's of steps I like the reward system but not how it disappears from my main screen can't say I'm that I'm happy with app..it had potential but for me no,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Need this to measure walking after recovering from foot op, however day 3, didn't measure my first two exercise walks, should be 800 steps, measured 71, not happy, will rather download and try a different app, just gets worse, did two more exercise walks, it recorded one,........... Definitely switching to more reliable app",2.0
Jeffrey Miller,Functional,On the map tracker add on I don't know what satellite it connects to (or tries to) but on a cloudy day it has a real problem. Other GPS apps have no problem.

A Google user,Functional,"Measures distances fairly accurately, but step tracker is COMPLETELY unreliable and inaccurate.

Kenneth Tuten,Functional,"I tried this for some time and really, really wanted it to be good. Sadly it was not.

Finally gave up.",2.0
Julia Priest,Functional,"Inaccurate. When it works it's great, but too often I will find that I ""only"" took 100 or fewer steps in a day, when I walked with my kid on her bike, walked the dog, did housework, went to the grocery store, etc. I carry my phone everywhere, and for it not to register even half my steps is disappointing. My other fitness tracker on the same device reports a much more accurate number of steps. This app gets two stars bc of the nice UI and potential.",2.0
D M,Functional,"Used this for years to track walks. Was really accurate with location (gps only). Last month or so my distances are off by up to 20%.

Lee Ly,Functional,"I was using it on another phone, always could check the step-count from the top of the screen. For whatever reason this function disappeared on another phone. I am checking steps only for the light curiosity, if I cannot do it easily - no point to keep this app. Uninstalled.",2.0
Jean Caswell,Functional,It not counting correctly it's different every day. I walk 4 miles. Some days at 2 miles it only counted 1 mile. So very unreliable.,2.0
Alnel Vincent Alico,Functional,"Inaccurate step counting, used together with three other step counter / pedometer apps, with each's sensitivity set to the highest level where applicable.

All the rest of the app seems to be fine though.",2.0
Muskan Porte,Functional,I loved this app at the beginning. Everything was good. But after using for months I've found that its efficiency has suddenly decreased. It doesn't count the steps accurately now.,2.0
Naomi filingcabinet,Functional,"It was inaccurate. I downloaded several pedometer apps to compare accuracy. Even with the sensitivity turned all the way up i was getting low results (by counting my own steps and comparing the numbers to those on the app) 500 steps taken = 369 steps recorded, 500 steps taken = 188 steps recorded, 100 steps taken = 47 steps recorded, 100 steps taken = 0 recorded. So, I deleted the app. If it had been wrong by a consistent ratio i might have kept using it and just done some math, but it wasn't.",2.0
Clint Ennen,Functional,I'd give it a 5-star review if the GPS wasn't always inaccurate when you first turn the app on. It can really screw up your record-keeping if you're not paying attention it'll add a half a mile or whatever it is until the app catches up. You think the developers would have the GPS refresh as soon as you open the app. But nope. I've reported the issue to the developers and they ignore me.,2.0
tianna,Functional,It seems like a good app but it's confusing too use. I'm walking but it says that it doesn't count as a step.i even put high sensitivity on even then it didn't count my steps. So personally I say go to a different app.,2.0
The Prez,Functional,It was working fine.But now it wont tranfer my results to Instagram it says 00.00 after doing 5 miles,2.0
Ebony Kindred,Functional,Randomly changes distance. I walked a trail about 4 miles 7669 steps. I hit pause and now it's showing I've walked 12.48 miles in an hour and 22 minutes. It's done this a few times.,2.0
Arthur Snelling,Functional,Good at first....now there are HORRIBLE full page adverts (with sound) to negotiate before you get to the app. A complete PITA. I also find it inaccurate. If I walk the same route in reverse the GPS always show a different distance - by as much as half a mile!,2.0
Steve Hackett,Functional,GPS tracker doesn't function when phone sleeps so you end up with a bunch of straight lines instead of the actual route you followed,2.0
Forest Frost,Functional,"I've downloaded this app several times on four different phones and two different carriers. The first time, it worked great, and I was very happy with how it worked. The second time, my history didn't transfer, so I just started from zero again. Later, the app started acting weird and gave me a lot of advertising in Russian. Since I changed carrier it hasn't worked at all. It only records a few points along a 4 mile hike, or says I walk 5 miles in 17 seconds. I'm looking for a new app.",2.0
RR Splinter,Functional,"It doesn't work properly. It stops counting. It stopped counting the very first day I downloaded it! It has not performed whatsoever. By the way....the app IS in the foreground. It is running, it just doesn't pick up. Those things ARE being done....",2.0
Vivek Kumar,Functional,I walked 3.5 km but this app is giving incorrect information. In 3.5km Google Fit is showing 4546 steps whereas Step Tracker is showing 2766 steps. Also Step Tracker is showing only 1.9km whereas actual is 3.5km. Google Fit is showing 3.3km atleast. So I uninstalled this app.,2.0
Cameron Michael,Functional,"I had the app for exactly one year, 365 days before uninstalling. I used it only for tracking my steps. It counted in intervals of ten not individually, so it wasn't always accurate. It also used to be ad-free. They've begun to add ads gradually. First only when you open the app, but now more and more common to see. I tolerated the app for a year, but have uninstalled because of these two reasons. There are better free step trackers out there. :)",2.0
Rosco S21,Functional,"Edit 20.5.23 Despite the developer promising to look into this, 3.5 months later there has been no progress here ðŸ˜• I've used this app since being in lockdown in 2020 and overall it's very good.

Dan D,Functional,"I get why there needs to be advertising on apps. The advertising use to be at the bottom which did not interfer with the functionality of the this app. Now, when ever I open it I get a commercial. This does not work well for a sports app that needs to be viewed in real time.",2.0
Darth Ruina,Functional,Apps is slower now. Needs a load screen every time you open it. This wasn't the case before. Also much less accurate. I would walk up and down my steps and around my 1st floor and it would show no steps at times. Totally weird app.,2.0

Have reported several times too but no feedback.",2.0
Michael Netherton,Functional,"This is a good app in theory, but in practice it leaves a lot to be desired. First are the sounds. They are annoying and irritating. There is no way to turn them off. Next is the lack of accuracy with gps tracking data. Many times it shows me walking through yards, fences and houses in my subdivision. My biggest complaint is the inability to export my data. I've asked for help but never received any help. I have close to 1,000 miles racked up but use another app now to track my walking/running.",2.0
Larry Schmitt,Functional,"Overall this is a pretty good app, but I've had a couple problems with it. First is, if I finish walking but forget to stop the app, it continues to add distance to my walk even if I'm not moving. Then today it did something unique. It showed me walking 4,785 miles in a bit over two hours. That works out to over Mach 3. The map shows me walking to London, Ontario (across Lake Erie, no less), and back, then up to Montreal and back, with a couple side trips to the south and east.",2.0

Eric Talkington,Functional,"App is PERFECT!

I had so many achievements and when I got a new phone NONE of the info transferred over. Most of the achievements I had the highest possible one done. It said I walked more than 99.9% of all users and I had to lose it all. That's why I only gave 3 stars. Otherwise it would be 5 stars easy!",3.0
brian adams,Functional,"It has some neat features. It would be ok for use in an area you're not familiar with I guess. The mileage isn't very accurate. I walk the same route everyday and the mileage changes anywhere from .6 to .16 miles. According to my car's odometer, it's anywhere from .2 to .36 miles off. According to Google maps, my odometer is accurate. The daily history completely forgot about my walk one day. The app needs a little work, but I guess it could be useful in some way to someone. Not many ads though.",3.0
Linda Hansen (Shappa),Functional,"The very first time I used this app, it worked great. No problems until yesterday, when I had my phone in my pocket.

Gary Wooding,Functional,"Installed easily and runs well on my Moto G5. But I would like to have a method of turning the audio off when I want quietness. I discovered a nasty problem when I tried to finish a training session last evening - an advert covered the entire screen!. When I tried to get rid of the advert in order to pause the program it switched me to the desktop where I had to invoke the app again. All in all, it took about 30 seconds to to reach the point where I could pause the app to get my time. Since the primary purpose of the ap is to record and TIME a training session, an unwanted advert that prevents recording an accurate time is a serious problem and needs to be fixed. Since this is a serious error I have reduced my rating from 5 to 3 stars.",3.0
Ottar Bergmann,Functional,I do more steps without my phone so i am at football practice abd some othe stuff but its cool it can know how much you drink and your health but not glad that i take at least 10k steps a day and i know it when i go home from school at least 1k steps but cool app so 3 stars,3.0

I can see no reason for this other than shoddy programming.",3.0
Gabriele Falcao,Functional,"I've started to exercise with the app, just walking at first, and now that I've been trying to jog and increase the distance it shows as if I'm walking a shorter distance than before instead?

Plus when you zoom in on the map it shows a super jagged route I certainly didn't make.",3.0
andrew degozaru,Functional,"Great discrete exercise motivator that gives positive encouragement. Easy to use. Worked great with my earlier model phone however it has some annoying system behaviour with the GPS tracking on my late model phone.

I shared the info with the developer but didn't get a response, unfortunately.",3.0
Matthew Levan,Functional,"I was happy with this app but have just had to uninstall and reinstall it because it simply stopped counting in the middle of a walk.

It does have a feature that allows you to track your water intake.",3.0
Ben Blau,Functional,This is a 3 star because it's very inaccurate. This also has ads every 10 mins you're on it. (But that's not so bad). The only reason it's not lower is because it's great If your running or even going on a walk with the GPS. That's it.,3.0

John Meachin,Functional,"Was great up to a few days ago, now both mine and my wife's are working but the step count is far less accurate than it was, it reads far less steps for a given distance.

Mike Stewart,Functional,"I love this app and it has been a significant additional tool in achieving a return to health following major surgery earlier this year.

All other metrics continue to accrue but distance remains inaccurate for the duration. Otherwise, the app is great! [Update] The response to my review apparently was for PR purposes only. I responded via all the channels suggested and never received a response on the issue so it continues. As much as I like the app, the customer service is non-existent so don't expect it. I am reducing the number of stars to 3.",3.0
Ken Black,Functional,"Worked great for years, now is erratic after either latest update to software OR to phone. I just submitted a log to developers via app, so maybe that will help. Example: walked yesterday in a forest preserve. App recorded 4,029 steps, but that I walked 0.22 miles! Today, it worked fine in a different preserve; 4,464 steps and 1.80 miles. The mileage accuracy is important to me because after spine surgery I find that if I would much more than 2 miles, I don't feel well later.",3.0
Sandra Adams,Functional,"It isn't very accurate in terms of distances, steps and map. I mapped my walk on Google map amd it says 3.8km, where is the app only said 3.16, which is a huge difference. In that one walk the step count is also 300 bellow what Samsung Health app (it has other issues, so I'm looking for a replacement app) counted. The GPS seems to have my starting point and then end point correct but it between there are not many points, mainly straight lines as I've walked through buildings rather than paths.",3.0
Monika,Functional,"I like the app. I am just super disappointed that when I drive, it still counts my steps. ðŸ˜¢",3.0
Mrs. Me,Functional,"It's okay I guess if you want a ballpark guess, it's not very accurate. Steps are off, speed is off and distance is off. It will show I walked 5.15 miles when finished then when I look back at my achievements it will only show 4.26 or something like that. That's a big difference like almost a whole mile, I know how long it takes me to walk 5 miles so I want to think the 5.15 is more accurate but still I would like accuracy. Also the map I don't even know what to say about that..it's a mess.",3.0
Carolyn Imhoff,Functional,"Inaccurate distance when tracking a run... I can run and walk the same loop and get different distances. I was thinking this might be bc it uses the stride length to calculate the distance. The problem being that your stride is longer when you're running (i.e. stride length might be 1.5 ft when walking and 2.5 ft when running). If this was fixed, I would definitely give this app 5 stars. Its simple and easy. And I like to aim for the achievements.",3.0

Dolores Cano,Functional,Since downloading the app I thought I was doing good.

That's good news other then that it ok for now. Love that it remine you how much water you drinking.,3.0
Lloyd Ettinger,Functional,"Works ok mostly, but can miss most of a hike, especially if the path has loops. Ability to control the calorie tracker with activity/terrain, like using trekking poles, 50lbs pack, speed/casual walking, hard/gravel road, wet/dry sand, trail blazing woods, etc. Will display daily ""likes"" from fake accounts. I'm sure it's a motivational tactic, but should be way to disable. More comparison distances would be a plus, like 'only 400 more miles to travel from home to North Pole'.",3.0
Titas Choudhury,Functional,"Very accurate and serotonin induicing. Reached the final achievement level and it just feels so good. Edited: Well the app's stopped working recently it seems.

Cozen KK,Functional,"While I have no problem with the step counter, the route and distance I walk is not accurate half of the time. It will cut off my route and mark another route that isn't a marked road or street. It will just cut across properties and areas that are swamps or heavily dense woods. There is no way to get an accurate mileage I walked all together. Which I think would help motivate me more.",3.0
Joyce Goudeaux' Fitzgerald,Functional,"Extra steps. Not sure why, but it's also tracking steps based on movement alone, and not just steps. I purposely stopped moving, and laid across my bed. Each movement I make, it counts as a step taken. Is this normal? I lowered the sensitivity thinking that would help according to the app. I also wanted to edit my steps back to the number it stopped on, and it wouldn't reset. How can this be fixed?",3.0
Jeffrey Nelson,Functional,"It's a good app all in all. It helps me to quantify my walks from day to day. But there are inaccuracies that pop up from time to time that may be more related to the tower signals than the app itself. Many times I'll walk about 2,700 steps and the application will only count it as .01 mile. At least, I think, it's getting the steps correct. Even so, if the accuracy could be tightened up, it would be nice. Thanks",3.0
Jen,Functional,"I would have given this more stars, a higher rating but it now just stops running.

Its really disappointing",3.0
Richard Blackstone,Functional,"Love the app for tracking. Only disappointing part is It seems like the people you ""compete"" with are just bots. I've seen several profiles with the same picture but different names so once you realize that you feel kinda silly. The entire competitive feeling disappears instantly because you realize you're competing with randomized bots that will accomplish close to your daily goal steps and a little more. I dont understand the need for that particular deception I guess?",3.0
Murali Karthick,Functional,"This app WAS good for the first few days. It recorded the steps, distance and time perfectly. But after the first few days, it has been doing some worse counting of the distance. It went so worse that for 5km that i walk every day, it showed 43km.

Jipson George,Functional,"App is not calculating the distance correctly, i daily walk through the same route but with different pace, 3 weeks back the distance was calculated as 8 km which now got reduced to 6.5 km.

Nick,Functional,"This is a fairly okay app if you just want to get a general idea of how much activity you're getting on a daily basis and, seeing this is a free app, the price is right for that. If you're in need of something with a little more accuracy, however, I'd recommend looking for a device that's designed with this service in mind --- which, sadly, means spending money. You'll discover with Step Tracker that your walk calculations can be off anywhere from between 200 to 2000 steps on any given day.",3.0
CJ Douglas,Functional,My first time using it today. I was disappointed that it didn't track my map/route correctly. I had set up a distance that I wanted to cover. Because it did not track it properly I have had to resort to using a different app to calculate how far I went. It would be good if there was a way to reset the map or correct it.,3.0
Nitin Prabhu,Functional,"There are bugs. When you start GPS before you start but then switch on some other app to listen to music while walking, then it stops tracking the distance. To track distance the app has to remain on & one cannot expect that it will track distance in background. Even only this app is on & with no other app on, the distance measure is incorrect. Eg today I walked barely 0.2 Km but the app was giving a reading of 1 km !!",3.0
Md Wabayadur Rahman Chowdhury,Functional,"I am a workaholic so I do not time for exercise in the gym. I was looking for an app where I can measure steps as I walk a lot because of my profession. However, I found this app which is good and enjoy the features. There something I want to add for getting the better version please do that. The UI should be more attractive, instructions needs video, training should work properly. The app counts the steps whenever I shake the phone. As a step tracker, it has a lot of ads too.",3.0
Freedom Wings (Cheryl),Functional,"Good app overall, but limited. Pls make way to edit amt of H2O drunk. If missed entry or past 12AM, there's no way to apply to previous day. If calibrated, it seems to track mileage accurately, but calibration can be set for only 1 mode e.g. walking; no way to set whether jogging vs. walking, or selecting a combo pace while in regulr mode. There's also no provision for choosing hilly vs. flat grade so calories burned is way off & not accurate unless just walking on flat grade. I like app. Thx!",3.0
Esi Zamani,Functional,"It is good, but in the new version on the Xiaomi phone, there is a problem with the pedometer notification and sometimes it does not show the steps. Please follow up. Thank you for your good program. auto start and battery saver It was checked, but the problem has not been solved in the new update",3.0
Norell Weiner,Functional,"First time using and not, exactly, thrilled. Did more than 5,000 steps for the 3,000 step goal which was fine. I stopped and turned around to head back home at slightly over the 1 mile mark (on the app) and literally went the exact same route and the app claims I walked only 1.55 miles. I find that highly inaccurate.",3.0
Cindy and Bill,Functional,"I really like the step tracker. Fits my needs. However there are times when set in trainer mode it doesn't track properly. For example, this afternoon I set it for 5 miles. Received the verbal notifications about progress and at 3 miles I was notified. Somewhere after that the app went into warp speed. What should have been 5 miles appeared as over 9 miles. It had me at over 22,000 steps. Odd. The step section was accurate after deleting trainer mode. How can this be prevented? Thanks.",3.0
LYNNE B RUSSELL,Functional,"Was working fine, but in the last week it has started freezing and not wanting to count steps. Only way I can restart it, is by turning my phone off and on. I don't want to uninstall the app bc I'm afraid I'll lose all my info it has tracked so far. PLEASE FIX THIS. THANKS.",3.0
DuÅ¡an,Functional,"This app is okay since it's not aggressive in asking you to allow this and that and to give your personal data, but as with many other similar apps it also requires mobile data turned on in order to get precise GPS info about how long was your walk (although GPS can work without internet, but not here) and mobile data turned on will affect your battery life (more drainage the longer you walk). Otherwise, without internet, it just sums up the number of your steps and then multiply them with the length of your step and this, in turn, is automatically calculated based on your height (providing you entered it). So, this is pretty inaccurate since your step can vary. It can be shorter when you are tired and drag your feet, and longer when you walk vigorously. I compared this app with Map My Walk. While this app showed I covered 1000 m, Map My Walk said it was 1250 m. Which one is right I don't know...",3.0
C Garner,Functional,It is good and useful. I like that you can edit steps if you go without your phone. Pretty stable in car mostly. Cons It gets stuck and won't track sometimes. I can't transfer my progress to my new phone. It ran out of achievements unless I do 60k steps in a day and up. That's about 10 miles!,3.0
Harj Rooprai,Functional,"Good app for when I was active a few years ago however noticed over the past few months, it has started tracking steps that are definitely not mine. It's tracking someone else clearly. Not sure how this happened, only ever used this app on my phone, have not changed the phone or logged in elsewhere. Had to uninstall as it kept giving me awards for achievements that are clearly not mine. Hopefully this bug gets fixed.",3.0
CM Horn,Functional,"Used to love this app, but since the new update it no longer counts steps. I've tried updating the permissions (they were all fine, but I turned them off and on again just to be sure), closing and opening the app, and restarting my phone but to no avail. Think I'm going to have to delete it, which is a shame.",3.0
S A,Functional,"My friend and I both use the app poll but when we walk together side by side, he somehow logs more miles than I do. Also, when I used it last night and pressed ""pause"" to drive to a different area it kept counting distance. Not all steps get counted into the log so when I go back in to check for the week, some days it says I did less than 5 miles when I know that I'm walking at least 5 miles every day. It used to be better.",3.0
Kyndel Richardson,Functional,I almost gave it a 4 star but my Maine issue is that it doesn't make you log in when you first open it. The reason thats and issue is I got a new phone and all of my progress was gone which is a little disheartening. It works great I love the achievements and its is motivating but if you just made it to where you had to log in at the beginning and it wod transfer over from account it would make it 5 star honestly.,3.0
Sean Pedersen,Functional,"Tracked steps well as far as I could tell, and the gps mapping looked pretty accurate. But there's no tracking of vertical, and I think their calories burned is off because of that. I'll look for something else.",3.0

Jim In Auburn,Functional,"Great design. But not accurate. One day my route is 1.3 miles, two days later it is only 1.1 miles. Went on a longer route that I checked with the car, Google maps, and another walking app that all day it is 1.9 miles, but this one says 1.31 miles. Not sure why it is doing that. If it was accurate it would be a very positive 5 stars.",3.0
Dave,Functional,"Haven't had this app for long but so far it ticks all the boxes for me, motifies me not to sit around as much Now as I have a chance to use properly, as a tracker it is very good but the number of ads are a pain also the ads are not just a small notification but a full screen job. May change to another app if they continue to be a pain.",3.0
Sarah English,Functional,Been using this since September 2020 and it's been really good at counting my steps. I also love that you can track your walks with the GPS map and view the route after you're done. This last month though I've found its suddenly being really temperamental at counting my steps. I've walked a good few hours today and had a run buts its only recorded 1000 steps which I know is wrong. EDIT: seems to only record Steps now when the phone screen is on.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I am somewhat pleased with app. I'd give 3.5 if I could. The tracking is not very accurate, but is in the ballpark. The tracking lines are Not close to straight even though my walking was straight. I am adjusting my step length to try and help the accuracy. I don't use the background feature.",3.0
Gordon â€œTonyâ€,Functional,I recently downloaded your app and I'm finding the distance I've walked is never the same although I walk the same course every day. I have increased my step distance from the automatic step your app calculated based on my height and weight from 2.5 feet to 2.10 feet to see if the readings will be more accurate. My weight is 197 lbs and some ounces. Do I need to be more accurate on weight? I'm using Samsung Galaxy S10+.,3.0
Deepumon. D,Functional,"I have been using this application around 1 year. It is very nice and I always wanted to track my steps when I walk. Sadly, formatted my mobile recently and lost all goals and previous achievements. Though I had back up to my email id, It is not get restored. I really wanted to see my previous achievements.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Just dont use the feature that lets you track your route and stuff. The voice is annoying AF and says weird ""motivational"" things. Also the notification never goes away telling you how many steps you walked, which could be helpful, but just annoys me.",3.0
Corinne Wheeler,Functional,"I used to love this app, it helped me become more fit than I've ever been. Then, it stopped working; I reinstalled it,turned it back,everything.

Santina Urrutia,Functional,"Its not very accurate. It keeps counting steps even though my phone would sit on my desk. Otherwise its nice though, it shows you all its widgets with days of the week, your average steps, the goal setter. Its all nice but I'd like for it to be accurate too.",3.0
C J,Functional,Little disappointed....my app used to work really well but now it won't even track my steps n every shake is counted as a step. I'm trying to find through settings a way to disable but no joy yetðŸ˜•. Still trying.. Hope it can be fixed as this or used to be such an amazing app and it really does aid s healthier lifestyle. If this can be resolved I'd not hesitate to upgrade the rating,3.0
Matt Blackburn,Functional,Liked the app. Can live with adverts as its free. But completly froze and stopped working / wouldnt start tracking my walks after 3 months. Wouldnt load or do anything. Had to delete it and lost all my previous activity which is frustraiting. Im installing again and hopefully it wont freeze up again.,3.0
Diana German,Functional,"Exactly the same has happened to me since the last update. A 3.7 mile walk which I do every week has suddenly become 3 miles and a lot less steps. I've had this app almost 2 years and believe me, I know I average 8.5km a day, not the 6.5km of the last 10 days or so. Annoying.",3.0
Jeffrey Dykeman,Functional,Good consistent step counts. However since most people need/ choose to replace phones every 2~3 years an option to transfer app history would be a major plus. I'm going to see if I can find a similar app with this feature.,3.0
Cody Middelkamp,Functional,A little clunky to navigate at first. Tracks steps well but distance is innaccurate. When using the training mode to track map of walked route it almost always drops GPS when locked and placed into pocket until i physically look at it again. Even more so if I have a Podcast or simmilar running in the background. Most accurate metric is cal burned so thats useful,3.0
David Crook,Functional,"Walking distances aren't accurate. Walked 7 miles today and the app only recorded 6 miles. Previous version I used allowed adjustment to step length, not sure why this is not possible. Clearly one size does not fit all.",3.0
Jon Hookey,Functional,"OK, but GPS is woefully inaccurate. I walked the same route on 2 consecutive nights, and there was a difference of nearly half a mile for a nearly identical step count. It's a shame as otherwise I would have given 4 stars.",3.0
Frederic Marais,Functional,This app has a tendency to not automatically resume after pausing during a training session. Very frustrating to realize your last hour of a hike has not been recorded. Not sure where the problem lies.,3.0
Ed Smith,Functional,"I'm rating this app as a 3 but it has the potential to go to 5. The past week I've walked 5 mile's per day, everyday.

Nicole M,Functional,"I have been using this app aimed May 29th with no problem. The last few days, i.e. today I was at 20.1 miles and it reset itself. Then I was at 1.48 miles as the stat over and it shot up to 6 miles. Not sure what's going on but please fix it. I love this app.",3.0
Michael M,Functional,"Good app. BUT - some days it registers zero steps - it just switches itself off! And there is no way I can find to switch it on!

Katie Budil,Functional,"This app doesn't seem to accurately track my miles. When I compare the miles I've run to the miles using my speedometer in my car, it is vastly different. I get that it may be off by a few tenths, but the same route driven and ran is off by miles.",3.0
Imraan â€œ_mraanâ€,Functional,Excellent GPS mapping for outdoor walking. Would be better to have a weather section to each session. Water tracker needs a custom cup size and there's no need for an animation every time I add to the tracker,3.0
Frank Hong,Functional,"Step tracker is largely accurate. However, the Leaderboard is a bit short: (1) right after midnight & maybe into 1 or 2 a.m. EST the ranked list randomly resets to the top 30 when scrolled down using the More button, (2) when functioning normally the max list is limited to the top 500, (3) no option to allow >30 per retrieval, (4) no way to Like back to fans who have Liked, (5) no mechanism that allows interaction among users, (6) allows only Facebook login, not even Google account login.",3.0

Bandana Choudhury (Seasons in the Sun),Functional,I have installed this app after reading the good reviews. But it keeps giving faulty readings of distance and steps. This has happened a few times and then I had to restart all over again. That way I had to lose the distance and step count.,3.0
Salvador Garcia Barrafon,Functional,"Sometimes the counter does not work. I don't know why. It isn't in pause. To fix it I have to open, put the pause on and after put the pause off. Then it starts to count. Another thing I don't like isn't the same number of counts as the phone one.",3.0
John Alexander,Functional,"When it works it's great, but it is frustrating when it stops counting, normally after the app has been updated but today it counted about 600 steps and then ignored a two mile walk and started counting again later in the day.",3.0
Noopsy,Functional,"Very good app, although the step count can be falsely produced to very high numbers by lightly shaking your phone up and down (as a step would move your phone) as long as you are producing As long as you are in some kind of forward motion (bike, car, unicycle, etc.). Unfortunately, I uninstalled because of this. Sorry.",3.0
Bill Davidson,Functional,"Pedometer count seemed consistent, agreed with other app. GPS distance also accurate, but disappointed no elevation stats offered.

Brandon Petroski,Functional,"This app used to be amazing, but the intrusive ads seem to actually be breaking the core functionality now. I've had several instances of the app simply not recording steps, because the ads had to load in. I'm a developer for a living, and my only educated guess would be that your ad module was trying to pull in data from your ad vendor, but since I was roaming or traveling, it couldn't pull the ads, and thus the step tracking functionality failed.

Esi Bossman,Functional,"This app is pretty amazing, I love that it tracks my steps accurately and that it keeps my training history.

Otherwise, no complaints. Thank you!",4.0
Javier Carranza,Functional,"The app has a good idea behind. Although it does it job and keeps you updated in calories and exercise, it has shortcomings. Technically, it fails in the counting of steps not only when you are not actually exercising but also in calibrating after pauses of not using the phone. When the mobile is left without much movement for a day or so, if you try to resume exercise it has issues to begin the counting of steps and underestimates 90% of your exercise. Maybe this is related to satellites.",4.0
Lou,Functional,"I really like the app. I like that it tells me my stats while walking. It's easy to use and I like the GPS portion.

Angela Mzunzu,Functional,Well it's pretty a good app it's able to record everystep that you take and you also able to track the amount of calories you have burnt.

Saq Saq,Functional,"It's a decent app, it has issues which annoyed me a lot, I've noticed those issues are fairly common among step counter apps. Still not happy but kind of forgiven. The only thing that actually can be changed is counting the 3k etc milestones, it stops after you hit 100 and you just get a star. I used to enjoy targeting the 3k milestone it is good knowing how many I've done 3k and so on. Let the counter keep counting, I want to see the full history, it's very encouraging",4.0
pete stott,Functional,I'm now at level 18 Does that mean once iv walked that distance is that the end of the app? So can you please let me know what happens after that please,4.0
Regina Robinson,Functional,"I like this app for the fun goals that help me aim to achieve the fitness goals I have set for myself. For example, I am almost done walking from Boston to Philly, only 20.1 miles to go. I've already walked over 400,000 steps since the last week of December 2020. I reached level 9 in the first week of April 2021. I had a 30,000 plus step day yesterday. I just updated the app and am disappointed that there are no new goals to meet. No new levels to achieve. No new distances to walk.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Since most of the latest smart phones have a sensor in the power button to read fingerprints, I would like to see if this app can be utilized to give a reading of a person's heart rate by touching the sensor. Also, I know the app tracks the steps when you move around, but would it also count the steps when you remain in one place (such as running/walking on a treadmill).",4.0
Theo Wellington,Functional,"Have used the app for a while, but had to reset phone....where did the data go? All files on phone and memory card were backed up. Was it somehow stored as part of the app? Would like a way to download the data. Update: found the place in the menu to back up data, which is good, but developers should use standard data files. This was the only app that I know of that did not backup using recommended means. I physically saved everything on the phone, should have been able to recover.",4.0
Jean Zuchelli,Functional,I like the app but it seems to quite in a few weeks then I have unstable it and then put it back in in a few weeks.,4.0
Christi Green,Functional,"I have used this app for over a year. I love the achievements! Gives me incentive! Up until this last few weeks it has been fantastic. Lately it has been losing steps ( no big deal, as I don't care about step number, just miles) so I had to use the GPS training. Now it is losing distance. What used to be 2 miles is now 1.8 miles. Hoping the next update fixes this.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,The voice updates are extremely annoying for me because it distracts from whatever I'm listening to. I've turned off all the voice options and it still does it pretty often. Please make a way to turn them off completely and you'll get 5 stars. The app is great otherwise,4.0
Andy Scott,Functional,"I use this for my daily walks. I like it because it's simple. I'm only interested in distance covered, time, calories and route. That is, simple basic stuff. Most apps are way over complicated for me giving stuff I don't care about. This one is good. Another bonus is it seems to work, every time I go walking and in different parts of the country. Brilliant. Elevation tracking would be a bonus, but never mind. My biggest gripe though: it produces a nice map of the route that I've walked, but if I use the Share to share with colleagues on facebook, it doesn't share the route map, only basic stats like miles, calories, distance. Or, am I missing something? I'd give this a 5 rating if it wasn't for that. Basically, If the route data is stored on my app, why can't I share it?",4.0
A Google user,Functional,This is a very useful app. Distance walked and speed shown are accurate to a great extent. But calories indicated is not consistent. please have a look into my data. For same distance it shows different calories at different time. For example one day i walked 7.63 km.it showed 304 kcal. Another day i walked 7.61 km and showed only 301k cal. Borh are wrong. I am a man with 83 kg weight. As per the literature i will be spending 70-80 kcal per km walked. But this app shows appx. 45 kcal per km,4.0
Ray Valverde,Functional,"The App so nice, I downloaded it twice. I use it on 2 different devices. It can be a little wonky at times, since I use a different device to listen to music on my walks, (yes I know there's a music mode, but I've been using Pandora for 5 years and have the playlist all set up), I miss the voice telling me what my mile time is. I walk a lot of hills, so I know I am burning more calories than shown but it gives you a good idea how well you're doing. I love the achievements! Nothing like positive reinforcement to keep you going. Just hit 330k steps today, for those from Los Angeles that's up to the top of the Micheltorena stairs and back...lol. Love the GPS tracking, helps me plan my next walk, or reference a walk for the same mileage. Good Job! Update: 6/24 Today the App told me that on my 5.88 mile walk, I only took 5084 steps, but yesterday it took me 11103 steps to walk 5.64 miles. That's why I won't give it 5 stars!",4.0
Thomas Lewis,Functional,"My app language changed to what looks like Russian. There's no option to change the language. How is the language changed back to English? Well, there was no language option on the profiles page - so I unistalled it and installed it - all that history was lost - it would have been nice not to lose any history - starting out on the ground floor again. Walked 100 days with over 6000 steps per day - total distance was approaching Sahara desert goal :-)",4.0
Sarah Roush,Functional,"This was a 5 star app until recently. When I select the GPS tracking for my walk, it's no longer accurate. I walk about twice as far as the distance it tells me I did. I might as well just use a stop watch in that case. Edit: make sure you have battery optimization turned off. resolved GPS issue.",4.0
W Alexander,Functional,"This app counts steps pretty accurately. I've counted along with it just to be sure and it was very close on medium sensitivity. So, a good way to log steps. One problem I've had is the distance counting. It is way off at times. Your set step length doesn't seem to matter. Once I walked 5.7 miles (I actually did my own calculation using the step length and step count) and it says 4.37. 10,344 steps at 35 inch step = 5.7 miles, which is more accurate according to GPS.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This is a very good app for anyone who wants to GPS track walks. It even speaks giving updates and words of encouragement while walking, plus it's nice to have someone or something to talk to during these times of social distancing ðŸ˜… The latest update has a slight problem with Bluetooth playback breaking up and the adverts are too intrusive otherwise I would have given 5 stars.",4.0
John Bickel,Functional,Very helpful tracking walks or runs but distance always changes after tapping FINISH. usually lose distance when looking at day or week totals. For so.e reason lost step & calotie counter 2 weeks ago. Also ability to send or receive likes. Looks as if all are restored. Also lost all achievements and totals of steps and miles. Can these be restored?,4.0
Rob Allen,Functional,"Easy to use, and until just a couple of days ago, a seemingly accurate GPS tracker for the walks with my dog. It would start with .32 miles on it, I know weird amount, but then count off correctly. Hopefully the update fixes that. Oh, but I have made it across the Sahara and we'll on my way to the center of the earth... lol",4.0
xnestlex,Functional,"Really good for version with ads but it has really weird or inaccurate distance measurement. For example I do run with steps counter + GPS tracker, I do ru 10.26KM but when I get to weekly report my score is usually 2KM less then what real time tracker says... I do consider to purchase ads free version but I'd like to know if there's a bug with distance measurement. Overall I do recommend this app, it keeps me going!",4.0
Gangadhar Sharma,Functional,"I have been using this since 4 months. Till now I have worked close to 1000 kms. Since about a week, the distance shown is highly. Erratic. Some times too little..or even too high. I have the latest version of the app. I have sent a couple of emails with screenshots. But did not get t any response from you",4.0
Francis Tabin,Functional,"Almost perfect, just some minor glitches. The water drinking will not count your entry if you don't let the animation finish hahah, and the TTS voice settings do not seem to work. Also zero response from the tech support, but it does the job well enough to get 4 stars.",4.0
Sean Campbell,Functional,"Great app and it's helping me stay on track. I would give 5 stars if the app had 2 extra features. First, a Finish my day option to lock in my passing my target, even if I change the target the next day. Second, I measure my height in feet and inches, but distance in km. It's imperial or metric right now. No hybrids. Thanks!",4.0
Ramy Abdel Wahab,Functional,"I started using it recently .. it is simple , easy to use ..Some benefits I liked : you can choose target distance, duration, calories or free mode..it updates you with your progress ""by voice"" every 10 minutes..There are daily reports and graphs to track your performance...One disadvantage: Few times it may hang ..Overall : Thanks Dear Programmers ðŸ‘",4.0
Chipo Nyasvisvo,Functional,"Very accurate. So far so good for me. The ads don't bother me much. They are not excessive. Wish it had more options to track your daily excercises. It only tracks, walk, run and bike. You cannot log previous workouts either like the other apps I've used in the past. Hence a 4/5 rating!",4.0
Katie Dolan,Functional,Only beginning to use app and already it is far better than others I've used! Setting goals and receiving achievements when completed has me eager to work harder and get more steps in each day ðŸ’ª My only question would be how to change distance from miles to kilometres?? Can't seem to find an option anywhere on the app..,4.0
Akhtar Manan,Functional,Its really a great App and step counting very accurately. There are a lot of more goals tables available which are really enjoyable and encouraging the achievement. However the widgets of this app if visible in the lock screen of mobile so it will be mire great and during walk there will not be required to unlock the screen.,4.0
Selina Wong,Functional,"Just started tracking my steps with this app. It's been wonderful! The only feedback that I want to give, is that I'd like it to automatically NOT count my driving as steps when I forget to pause. Pokemon Go for example doesn't allow driving to be counted towards egg hatching.",4.0
ExoticWaffle,Functional,"I've been using it for a while and really like it, but one time I did training and for some reason it did not count my steps correctly although it has worked fine before and nothing changed in my walking, apparently I walked 3 km with only 300 steps when it usually takes about 3000?ðŸ˜‚ Other than that it's good, it was just kinda annoying that I met my daily goal but it didn't count it (although the distance was correct)",4.0
Anouschka van Wettum,Functional,"Great app, no annoying ads (very unusual for a free app) and it definitely urges me to move more. Funny awards to keep you motivated and great insights into your moving patterns daily. Only downside is that you'll need to charge more often but as it has to track your steps all the time it's understandable.",4.0
Lauckness Monster,Functional,"Works well. I think it sometimes picks up some steps while I'm driving in a parking lot, but you can avoid that by pausing when you get in the car. I wish you could switch your distance to km instead of miles though",4.0
Wadering Star,Functional,"It's great app. Just one feedback if it starts counting normal steps while we roam around the room, it will b great. Otherwise, it counts km, area where we walked (map), calories burnt, steps. It motivates us by showing diff levels. Best thing it's Free. Loving it",4.0
MLD,Functional,"Have tried a coupld of these and this is my favourite as it's simple and gives me the info I want. Also it doesn't guilt trip you if you don't exercise every day, or try and make you do more. Only downside is that it can turn itself off when I go out unless I check that it's still on and recording my steps.",4.0
Brian Silva,Functional,"So far good. Interface is clean and well laid out. My only suggestion to the developer would be to be able to input the stride of your walk in foot measurements as oppose to low, medium or high. Other than that, great app!",4.0
Steve Utermahlen,Functional,The app works well. It provides me with essential info and current updates when reachinga goals. It has ads but what do you want from s free app. It does have a glitch when starting out like adding a few unearned steps but I delete them right away to get a more accurate count.,4.0
Amanda Clarke,Functional,"I have using this for the last 2 months and have found it really good. I like the achievements and that you can set your own goals, this keeps me motivated. The last 2 days the km having been calculating properly so just did an update so hopefully this will fix this glitch",4.0
Qing Cao,Functional,Pro: Simple interface. Easy to navigate. Highly recommended for beginner walker or jogger like me. Con: No issues with GPS for the first few days then suddenly the GPS tracking stopped working. Still do the job though. Give 4 star because of the GPS issue.,4.0
Abigail Carroll,Functional,"I love this app but I am a little bit upset. I just got a new phone and since there was no way to save my previous progress, I have lost it all. App is really simple and easy to use. Very encouraging. It's fun and easy to aim for prescribed goals and even set your own.",4.0
Ed Short,Functional,"Like that you can turn it on and off, pause it. When you pause it, the background turns black, making it very difficult to read in sunlight. Works well for measuring distances, and creating walking routes.",4.0
Jyoti patel,Functional,"Great going,Our running is low, so it reminds us that we have to walk even more. We try to achieve something full. When we wake up in the morning, we do not use mobile, so our exercise and walking reading is not there, that is the fault, the rest of the app does excellent work.",4.0
Oxeye,Functional,"This was a pretty good app at one time, but now it just wears you out with ads and questionnaires. - I added a star because I still use the app and LFG responded to my review. The problem is that developers naturally want to monetize so every attempt to usually just makes the app worse. I feel their frustration but the bottom line is that with every tweak to wring some cash out of the thing, it further degrades it's usefulness.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Installed in conjunction with Map Tracker(strange this doesn't show in installed apps? May have installed it from within the app.) and accurately plots walks. Pedometer seems pretty accurate but distance covered widely out. Calculated length of step to use and increased sensitivity. Step length now 2' 10"". Should be over 7' tall. Haha! I've tried other trackers but this is the best. Found where to put personal details. Bltooth h/phs on and didn't burn too much battery. So good I've bought it",4.0
A Google user,Functional,Like the app. Seems very accurate. Will uninstall though if I can't find a way to turn off the verbal updates. Even with the phone sound off this app's audio still activates which is embarrassing at times.,4.0
James Noonan,Functional,Really like the app design and functions. It computes steps very accurately for me. Computes a calorie burn which seems reliable too. The GPS distances were a off a good bit. Covered a known distance of 3.92 miles and Step Tracker only counted 3.45 miles.,4.0
Lynne Shaw,Functional,"I love the simplicity... But recently the tracking of the route or the distance has been way off. I've sent reports from within the app, and updated yesterday hoping that might fix things, but it hasn't. Please fix tracking.",4.0
Scott Harlow,Functional,I lmost maxed out all of the achievements and totaled over 1200 miles in 4 months. Now the GPS has stopped working and the walking trail has gone haywire. I just did the update so hopefully that will fix it. A great app but I'll find another if these issues continue,4.0
huslaine maxwell,Functional,"Very happy with it & the achievements give you that small psychological push to stay consistent (but its purely a personal vanity thing). One thing missing is I would like to be able select certain timespans (maybe by holding or tapping both the start and end time of the day with different fingers simultaneously, see Apple iOS health app) to see the total amount of steps/kms I've walked in that specific period (for example between 5pm and 8pm) instead of adding up each hour in my head manually.",4.0
Hannah.B Love,Functional,Amazing app really useful and plays a big part in my weight loss programme xx,4.0
Tbret Rickert,Functional,"It does exactly what it claims and runs well in the background. Since my original review there have been some issues with the app not counting steps. Overall it still works well, but I have to change to 4 stars.",4.0
John Neidigh,Functional,Canâ€™t figure out how to simply start and stop daily steps to keep a CONSISTENT record in the mySugr app. I just want it to AUTOMATICALLY show me how many steps I take each day (@ ANY set time) preferably in a scrollable table (mySugr should have this option instead of itâ€™s silly â€œenter a number of stepsâ€,4.0
Zakiyah Hyman,Functional,I like it it's great it's just it sometimes doesn't actually count the step,4.0
Mike Pro,Functional,This app is really good my only complaint is that the fasting portion of the diet plan has no countdown clock it just says the amount of time you have to fast and the eating window it would be alot better as a motivator and more intuative of an app to see how far you have come as opposed to having to keep up with it on your own.,4.0
Mitchell Sanchez,Functional,I like it never realized how much I walked quite amazing when you don't have a car. Only thing that I wish you had was a meditation type of workout as well to add to the cool things they already has with it I really do love this app not too many ads and it's really cool.,4.0
vaishali leekha,Functional,This is an amazing step counter app!!!!!! As we do workout daily but we couldn't calculate of total workout so it helps us a lot in getting our daily workout info.. there is another benefit that from this we can listen to the songs and keep doing our workout ðŸ˜,4.0
Rowan James,Functional,"Took ages to find previous walks. Press GPS, then ok button top right.",4.0
Meg Chua,Functional,"App is very good but one thing that it could improve on is, it's pausing during exercise when you're not doing anything on the phone and just leave it on your pocket. You have to resume it to continue.",4.0
Florence Lam,Functional,The app is great and reliable. It is useful in motivating me to exercise because I can track my progress. It would be helpful if the historical log/report includes pace per km so that I can review my average pace speed per day or week.,4.0
A&Pmcn,Functional,I find this app motivating. I like when my footsteps are automatically shown on my home screen. I wish my progress and data was brought forward to my new cell phone when I changed phones. Now on my new phone I am starting from scratch at the bottom levels.,4.0
Marcia Wilson,Functional,"It's a good app. Only thing I've to criticize is: the associated GPS tracking accuracy is laughable. But then that has been in my other uses too, so I'm not shocked. It puts me places in my 2-acre yard I haven't been in days. GPS has, in the past also located my house in the middle of the highway, wrong side of it, and (before I corrected it) twenty miles east of its true site. Go (re)figure!",4.0
Debasis Biswas,Functional,Excellent performance and good calculation methods are received from the app. But from the last two days it suddenly stopped calculating the steps and started from the beginning again and again. Thank you,4.0
James Ashton,Functional,"A little tough to understand at times, but it does its job, and I mean it seems very accurate so I'm happy to stick with it. I like the achievements you can unlock too, and I feel this can motivate someone to carry on exercising and go that extra ""mile"", so to speak.",4.0
Landyn Parkin,Functional,It's a good app. It doesn't always count all of your steps. I would prefer a watch because it stays in place. It's good for taking a walk or run. It's not for playing sports because it's heavy and will fall out of your pocket. But overall I give it a 4 star because it doesn't count all of your steps,4.0
Carol Dreyer,Functional,"Love the new app for me. I've tried others and they didn't work properly after awhile. I hate the ads, but I realize that the company needs them.",4.0
Andy Lester,Functional,GPS accuracy has improved again. Thank you. Can I make one suggestion? The ultimate target is km to Earth's Core... what would be more fun is to say you've walked distance to Siberia etc. and have bigger targets that we can aim for. I will have reached the Earth's core soon... no clue what that looks like... then what's my target?? :)),4.0
Adrienne Yt 22,Functional,"I tried another app before this one. I was really intent on recording my steps. I would walk about 5 miles, it would give me credit for 1. It seemed like it would stop tracking whenever my screen went off...THIS one is giving me everything I want, 100 percent. Bug difference. All I wanted was a record of miles, steps and time . Perfect. Very accurate. So happy with this!!",5.0
Jeff Frank,Functional,"Very good for tracking miles walked. I use it at work and play...it's easy to use and not a bother. It let's me know when I have reached a goal walking and sets new goals , for me great app............ the review is kinda long wanting 500 words to explain how good it is they need to cut it back like 200 words. Or they can just let you put words in to get past this and go on to ratings and back to your phone. I hope they correct it and make it simpler for us. I tried to think of everything bye",5.0
Andria K,Functional,This is an awesome step tracker. If your just curious how many you walk on a regular basis or if you need a little push to start moving. It really works for everyone. I really enjoy the option to compete with people near you. That definitely gives an edge for wanting to do better. And I really enjoy the drink more water reminder. That's just fun!,5.0
CLINT MCCLELLAND,Functional,"Only used for a couple of days but impressed so far. I walked over 3 miles yesterday and confirmed with Google maps the distance and periodically checked the step recording accuracy. I am an engineer that has precisely measured my average stride length and results lined up well and met expectations. The ad experience has been minimal so far with the free version. That said, I typically upgrade to ""ad free"" in most apps if the free version performs well.",5.0
Rick G,Functional,"Exceeds my expectations. I use it to track walks & hikes for time, distance, steps, calories, activity history and achievement of goals. Really like the (optional) voice feedback which provides occasional status reports (time, distance, calories, pace, progress toward goals) via my Bluetooth wireless headphones while listening to music. Paid the one-time $2.99 to get rid of ads and it's worth it. All around great app. Highly recommend.",5.0
down2two Liketoknow,Functional,I started walking for my health and this has been really nice it has the GPS function. I can track the mileage from one point and then restart and to another point. It's very nice. Very helpful it also lets you put in your personality data like your weight so it can also do some calorie calculating. It also keeps track of how fast you walk. I highly recommend this app for anybody who's walking for their health.,5.0
William Wilkerson,Functional,"Simplest to use of all, and coincidentally, it has the best combo of features, all in the simplest to use interface to use compared to other competitors that I've tested... Unfortunately, the competition has noticed, as I watch in real-time as both the similar existing apps seemingly become more like Step Tracker by copying every aspect of this app with every revision, masquerading these changes as merely ""updates"" -- while new apps just shamelessly copy, thankfully failing at every step...!!!!",5.0
Cozy Castle,Functional,"It's the best app I have on my phone. I'm not just saying that, it's truly a daily motivator for me. The app achievements section is great but could be expanded and different sign in options instead of just Facebook for the ranking system would be great. Maybe use Google to sign in or allow users to input their own user name for the ranking system. Still, out of all of the step tracker apps I've tried out, this one has the cleanest design while simultaneously being packed full of features.",5.0
Nickolas McAnally,Functional,"This app has been great for keeping track of progress, it is encouraging with the badges, and the GPS is better than any other tracking app I've had, and I went through about six others. You also can plan for say a 1 mile walk, but at the end you still wanna keep going? It lets you know your time at 1 mile, but will keep tracking extra progress automatically. It helps to not have to start and stop constantly.",5.0
Laura McCullum,Functional,"Awesome at keeping track of your movements whether walking or in the car.... It has one little lag in it... when it starts to keep track of steps you might think it's not working cause it doesn't count right away... but not long after you start it, it will catch up the steps and you'll be able to watch 1 step at a time counted by the app... It's pretty cool and basic... it's perfect what I was looking for... oh it also tracks day by day and week by week so on so you can look back at past days",5.0
Robert Lee Raimondi,Functional,So far it's been really great. I've been wanting to get a step counter and a fitness device for my wrist but in the meantime I'm using this app and I will probably continue to use it after I get the wrist or wearable device. It seems to be accurate gives you some good metrics and a map of the route that you took. There are some ads but they're not very intrusive and they don't seem to be causing a negative experience,5.0
Larry Bogan,Functional,Super simple and fun! I've only used it once but I like it already! I don't know how accurate it is because my wife wore her Apple watch and it showed 1.5 miles walked whereas mine showed 1.7 mi walked. I like how it praises me at mile markers. I got an attaboy at 1 mi and I got confetti at the end of my walk.,5.0
Riley Renteria (Stay),Functional,"I love the app a lot, it's fun to see where I've gone and stuff and the steps are accurate. I like that it reminds you to drink water and sometimes motivates you when you track your walk or run. The only thing is that the water drinking is weird because obviously it has no idea how much you drank but it does give you goals! Overall, 10/10",5.0
Shari Bradley,Functional,"This is a great pedometer except for one thing. Obviously is you aren't holding, carrying or having your phone on your person, your steps cannot be counted in those instances. I like it though and it's very accurate while you have your phone. So I will continue using it some. I also wear my sports band when it is charged.",5.0
Ken Woods,Functional,"seems realy good to me so far,,, I'll take back my 4 star and give it a 5 love the fact that you can have it run in the background,, sometimes you forget to turn it on and then sends you reminders about how for you walked and more",5.0
Berlie Clabough,Functional,I do cross country and track this satisfied me because I got so much better that the your before in those sportsand it absolutely amazing you can set goals and and finish them and make more .Everyday I get better instead of laying in my bed all day I get and I run hike walk the reason why I'm not in my bed all the time is because how can miss out on a good healthy walk .THIS HELPS ME AND I LOVE IT 5 STARS.ðŸ˜Š,5.0

Maureen Ndubuisi,Functional,I lost my smart fitness watch at Walmart and couldn't afford another one at the moment but needed something to track my progress with weight loss when I saw this app. This app has helped in shielding the pain of losing my fitness watch. So that I can still count my steps and track my progress. I am grateful. Thank you ðŸ˜Š,5.0
Lisa Bjerkness,Functional,The GPS seems a little off saying I'm jumping through yards when I'm using the road lol. But besides that tracks steps and calories well. I highly recommend this app for people that want to count steps and calories. Great job developer stay awesome. ðŸ˜€,5.0
Michael N,Functional,"Very useful and accurate, doesn't confuse driving on bumpy roads etc with walking.",5.0
Leigh Donoghue,Functional,"ROB What do u want for nothing??? Would you rate any stars if the FREE step tracker actually done the steps for you, you can easily pay for one then ridicule it when it tells u u havent hit ur target......

Hoskins Donna 65up Haskins,Functional,"My experience has been awesome and amazing. If I walk 6000 steps 3 days a week. I ,,have 7 pounds already. Sometimes I don't even realize how much I walk. Yesterday I did 10000 steps. I like when they show you that you have research. Certain goals and it goes on and on. Thank you so much for whoever created this app. It works if you put the work in it. I don't have it in my budget To join a gym this works for me thanks",5.0
Joseph Innocent,Functional,Over accurate step counter. Best of all apps. Does anyone have to get another step tracker apart from this application,5.0

Iani Thompson,Functional,"Simple, it just runs in the background and gives you little targets to aim for, tried a different app but came back to this, appart from adds which can be a bit incongruent I.e. McD,s...",5.0
jim kahn,Functional,"I use this app quite a bit for the last year when I was walking or cycling. But in the last month or so, it would Screech instead of speak a countdown for example. The sound was like fingers on a chalkboard. I have no idea why the speech engine went so poorly. This is the only reason why I gave it three stars instead of five. Note: Thanks to feedback advice from the developer, the app is now working perfectly again. I am now giving it 5 STARS!",5.0
Bueno Perder,Functional,"I like the features. First of all it of course, tracks your walking after permissions are granted, reminds you to drink (I've been drinking water MUCH more because of this one app) water regularly and design and feel is more than enough for me. One thing: The app isn't very accurate when on Training mode on the map. If you stand for a second like looking at how good you did on it, you'restill moving on the map. That might be an issue that's enough for a person to uninstall. Though, not for me.",5.0
john tamind,Functional,"This is a great little app. Pedometer is pretty accurate. It does miss steps, sometimes, when you do a very short burst of activity (maybe for a duration of <10 steps). But overall, excellent. If it had a paid version without ads, I would get it. However, the ads don't interfere too much. Can change languages. Has many nice little features besides steps. Keeps history, etc. I have been using for over a year now.",5.0
Nina ArensonEscorcia,Functional,"Great app, it barely has any ads it doesn't lag at all and it's easy to use. There's really nothing bad about it in my opinion. In the app, you can have a water tracker that reminds you when to drink water. There's also a step tracker that tracks your steps. It doesn't count when you are running though. Would definitely recommend installing it if you want to track your steps or if you want a reminder when to drink water.",5.0
Luke Etchingham,Functional,A little intrusive (for me) in the default settings. But it is easy to switch off notifications. Then it becomes an accurate step counter and walk tracker. The first one I've found that doesn't bug. All the competitors that I have tried seem to find it difficult to produce an accurate final map. This one works perfectly. Exactly what I wanted. Easy 5 stars.,5.0
David Lucas,Functional,"I've had this app since May 2020 when my city went into a hard covid lockdown with a 5km distance limit. It kept me motivated to walk/run local streets, and I've kept on with it, hitting my 10,000 steps a day. The optional GPS tracking is great to calculate average step length for walking or running too. I'd love to see a couple of additions, or perhaps I'm missing something. 1: It would be great to see total distance and calories since installing. 2: Sometimes I get a notification ""New Record Created!"" and when I select it, the app only shows me my step count for the day. I'm left wondering what sort of record I created.",5.0
Apex Stock Charts,Functional,"A good app. Started using it yesterday. Only problem is with the GPS. The results of my run do not show the map. Otherwise, still early days and 65% satisfied.",5.0

Jacques,Functional,It will be nice to have an option for treadmill. The developer answer very quickly and soon it will be an option for the treadmill and outdoor walking. Great apps,5.0
Jonathan Hamilton,Functional,This app just runs in the background and encourages you to walk more to achieve a better step count. How wonderful. Make exercise more fun.,5.0
Cynthia Daire,Functional,"Great app! Easy to use! Gives you info on how many steps and how far you walked. Love the level tracker. Your own personal ""high 5"" on doing an awesome workout.",5.0

A Google user,Functional,"It's not often I bother to pay to remove ads but I did for this one, even though they're not intrusive. It's a really good little app and seems to do the job. The GPS tracking appears very accurate and I like how it can give voice updates to save checking the screen while walking, it's just a well designed and thought out. The only downside is I can't put it into my family library, which is a shame.",5.0
Saranne Holmes,Functional,"Great app. I like that it starts working as soon as you pick up the phone without having to start it. The exercise mode is really motivating and encourages me to take a longer route to work, etc to meet my goals. Good that it tells you how many calories you've burned as well. It does seem to accurately record all my steps too unlike other apps I've used that are less responsive. All round really good app.",5.0

Caroline-Matilda Henley,Functional,"It's pretty good- there's a bit in the notification bar that lets you know how many steps you've done that day, and how many calories you've burnt, and it's pretty accurate. You don't check the app itself that often, but there's all sorts there, like hourly, daily and weekly counters. The ads aren't too obtrusive, and doesn't effect the functionality. Would recommend!",5.0
Dennis Bathory-Kitsz,Functional,I love this simple app -- but I moved to a new phone and now all my historical data is gone. How do I recover it? Asking again. Any way to recover data before phone change?,5.0

shanvi s,Functional,"Easy to use, and very convenient. It tracks your steps much better than any other app I have used. Loving the updates! Easy on your eyes when you want it to be. Overrall, I have had a very good experience with this app and would highly recommend you to download it! It doesn't drain your battery toouch and it takes up very little storage.",5.0
David Horner,Functional,Great ap. Really enjoyed my walk. Also loved the explanation of the number of steps. Miles walked and Calories burned. Also time taken to complete. Thank you so much. Found you again on 14/9/2023. Enjoyed my walk today. Thank you so much.,5.0
Charmaine Viljoen,Functional,"Had this app for almost a year now, and when I started running it was just to get more active. Now I actually train for races and now that I actually train, now the app started to give problems especially with the GPS tracker. I really need to track the distance that I run and also my time. This is still by far the best app and I truly don't want to delete it. I love that there is no ads and it's pretty easy to use. So if you can upgrade the GPS tracker. It will be fantastic.",5.0
Tara Salyers,Functional,I just recently downloaded this app and it is a lot more accurate than any other apps I've used It has counted every step I have taken opposed to other apps I've used and only kept track of the outside steps. Definitely give you a A+,5.0
Kel Stalker,Functional,"Pdated Accurate and easy to set up your profile Inc. body weight, step length, how tall you are, and once the learning period is finished, it runs perfectly incl a built in GPS tracker. Mine has been running every day and the progress reports are updated with graphs and charts. It's an 'all in one) and the last step tracker app you will ever need!!",5.0
Drew Hussey,Functional,"It's a good app. Monitoring how far you go is good for anyone, especially those who are watching their activity when it comes to a fitness or a weight loss program or if you just like to hit a target. It's also good to be able to show the doctor or nurse who may be monitoring you as well because you can see when you are most active during the day. If you miss steps you can also edit them back in at the time you did them.",5.0

Protons and neutrons.,Functional,"I've been finding this app more useful than I even thought it would be as a person who has severe anxiety I tend not to want to go outside, but this app actually forces you to go outside and walk around and jog because it shows you the lack of movement its a motivation to be more active so it's actually so beneficial in many ways,thank you.",5.0
Alejandro Torres-Vielmas,Functional,"Nice app, simple to use, no ads (except a little bar in the bottom of the screen, but who cares). I just downloaded it today and it worked perfectly for my first walk. I like that every mile OR every 10 minutes it tells you how you are doing and your time done in each mile. It keeps you motivated and you can seamlessly listen to music with it running and giving you these voice messages. Overall a perfect nice app.",5.0
Susan Brown,Functional,I'm beginning for the second time walking/running. I quit for a year. So I'm very excited about this thorough app,5.0
Sisca Christina,Functional,"Good, easy to use. But sometimes the kcal count seems to be not accurate.",5.0
korian sarafian,Functional,"It is a fab app. Accurate time and Distance. Not sure if calories are reall or accurate. Through GPS shows on the map the path walked or traveled. Very accurate. Paste perhaps would have been better in km/h. It also periodicly tells you traveled distance, time , paste and calories. No annoying adverts, only one short at the beginning. Well recommended.",5.0
L McGowan,Functional,"I've been using this app for 7 days. I like the way it tracks your steps, distance, the route you have taken & the calories burned. I understand some people have issues with the vocal encouragement. When I don't want to hear it, I turn my volume down or off & leave my mobile on vibrate. This works for me.",5.0
Dua'a Abdel-Razzaq,Functional,"This app is great! It tracks your walking path and shows it to you, it tracks your distance in km or mile, it gives you an estimated calories lost after each walk, it counts the steps, and every walk is saved in ""history"" with all these data with the dates! So you can actually track your past achievemenst. Another beautiful thing is that when you press finish after walks, it says (yes with a voice not just a text) something motivational and nice, it makes me smile and feel more motivatedðŸ˜‚ðŸ’œ",5.0
Dayla Arnold,Functional,The app is very easy to use. The only problem that I can spot is the inaccurate step counting. I walk 12 steps it says 16 but I'm not complaining. All apps using a phone will have this problem since it is based on movement. Also this app motivates you to walk with the use of milestones. I have only been using g it for a day but so far I really like it.,5.0
Nebulon Azu,Functional,"This app was great! Unlike many pedometers I have found, it starts counting when I start walking, unlike another which you have to get on the phone before it starts counting each day. It actually counts every single step 1 by 1, and adapts to how fast you go. It also has a map feature, allowing you to keep track of your surroundings as you walk.",5.0
Michelle Koch,Functional,"I do a lot of back and forth walking at work, so wanted to be able to calculate how much. The app is easy to use, runs in the background so i don't have to set it, and shows up in my drop down menu at the top for a quick peek. I love that it also gives calories burned to help me log that info into MyFitnessPal. Doesn't suck my battery like other apps have",5.0
Susan Davis,Functional,"I had reached all but two goals when I had to reset my phone because of issues with my messaging that I couldn't resolve. I was disappointed to lose all my accomplishments, but now am excited to reach all those milestones so much faster!

Ed Candelora,Functional,Honestly I was just looking for a quick install of a reasonably accurate app to track my walking progress during the pandemic shut down.

Florence Nesbitt,Functional,"Thia is an amazing app!!!! I was walking my dog, and I set a target for 3km, and although some reviews say the voice was annoying, I just put head phones in, and it was fine!!

Rich (Thump),Functional,"I have used this app for years...it may not be as accurate as a pedometer... personally this app has been more accurate than any that I have used. Iong distance hike and for use over terrain, it is spot on accurate. If you're expecting great things using it around the office and house then get a pedometer. This App is suited for a more ""motivated"" hiker genre. Edit... 6/29/23 still the absolute best app there is.",5.0

B Lamba,Functional,"Great App! I downloaded it last week - and have used it past 2 days -- each time for walking about 4 miles. Each time provided all the relevant info: time, distance, number of steps, and calories burned. The numbers provided are accurate - each time I verified using another app that is popular but I do not its interface. I like this app since it is easy to use. It shows the route for each walk. And keeps records of each walk in history. I plan on using it for daily walks. You Can not go wrong with this app. I highly recommend it and give it 5 stars.",5.0
Michael Syvuk,Functional,"I love this app and use it constantly on my walks. It has definitely kept me motivated to keep walking and keep meeting the goals. One thing i don't understand though is the daily goal never changes. The faq says it changes depending on my stats, but I've consistently doubled the daily goal and the goal has yet to change.",5.0
Tanushree Roy,Functional,I like how the steps count are accurate and it has water tracker too. It works in background so you don't have to open it everytime before you go for a walk. You can add a widget on your home screen too. The badges encourage me to walk more. The ads are skipable. Overall it's good you can go for it.,5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Wow! This app is awesomely accurate. When my wife and I walk, we almost always travel the same path. My stride is very close to a yard. When I add up the distance, either with Google Earth or manually, they always match up with the app. The programmer who wrote the app is a genius! The great things about the app are the reliability of measure, notifications, and the user interface. Simply marvelous! If you ever need beta testing of new stuff, please let me know!",5.0
Dee Scustin,Functional,"Very glad I found this. It is easy to set up. It is based on steps and tells you when you pass 3000, 7000 etc. Each day it gives you total miles walked. It also has a timer to alert you to drink water that you can adjust to amount you want and time. You can turn off GPS, or use it for trails. You can set goals for calorie burning.",5.0
Roni Ross,Functional,"Very easy to use, I especially like seeing where I've walked, not just having the step count, timer & KCal calculator. I did the March Challenge this year, 'Walk 10,000 steps everyday in March For Cancer Research' & this App would have been a real asset to show not just the step count, but journey walked! I volunteer with our 'Local Litter Legends', so this app will be ideal to show the roads I've walked to litter pick, so I can send this into the group feed to keep track of progress.",5.0
Michel,Functional,"I have my phone in my front pants pocket and it seems to work regarding counting steps. Interestingly it counts the same amount of steps as a sport app I also use. You can view your step history, and the app gives a summary of your weekly or monthly average. The interface is easy to use and pleasing to the eye, no unnecessary options and clutter. Pop-ups and awards etc. you can disable through the app and or using Android settings. There is a small widget which only shows your steps",5.0
Miguel Andrade,Functional,"So far so good. I just installed this app today and have already achieved 10,447 steps despite weighing over 400 lbs. Even though the constant notifications are great encouragement, for me, they can get a little annoying when I'm expecting an important text. Every time my phone vibrates I think it's who I'm expecting a text from but it's just the app telling me how great I'm doing. It's excusable because those notifications put a smile on my face after I see what it's about.",5.0
Anne B. Sanchez,Functional,"I love this app. I am pretty much homebound since long before Covid, but I like trying to increase my steps slowly and surely. I can look at them and decide whether to increase my steps or maintain them for the time being. I had to learn how to walk again after an accident. This keeps me moving. If I can build up the strength I may be able to avoid a surgerie(s).",5.0
Michelle Q.,Functional,"Absolutely love it!! I had a few hiccups at an update but the developers immediately handled the issue.

Daniel McCain,Functional,"Very good devise; it's better than the trackers I used in the past (the step or distance trackers that hung from the belt. For inaccuracies, they were excellent). I need a walker or a cane to be ambulatory, so that might affect my results. The purpose of the aides is to steady me when I am standing. I used to fall often (down; falling up is infrequent & is not recommended). I weight more than I should. That, I attributed to my height. I'll try to increase my height, soon, as I walk.",5.0
KellyAnn Walsh,Functional,"App works well. My only issue isn't with the app..it's the fact that phones are so large and heavy these days that it doesn't fit in most pockets or pulls on clothes if it does fit. So, more often than not, the phone is left on table or in purse and all those steps can't be tracked. Lol!",5.0

Freebird,Functional,"This is so satisfying. And it works, I've held it in my hand, it's not a gimmick. To think I walked 100km in 2 months is amazing, and had I not had this, I wldnnt have known how my new, go for a walk everyday, was stacking up. It's a nice interface, v simple, no harsh graphics, yes I would totally recommend this app, to anyone, it's good to see your fitness levels.",5.0
Sherry Quinn,Functional,"I have tried 3 other step counter apps and was not happy with them. Decided to try one more time before giving up. I like this one alot.

I have told friends and co-workers about it.",5.0
k.a. wilson,Functional,"This app is a breeze to use, syncs beautifully with G-Fit and my nutrition app, and encourages you at every small step (you choose your milestones). The app is nearly effortless to use. Free version is tap start and walk or run, and choose your distance goal.

Ben Jackson,Functional,"Was a great step counter. Not sure what happened, but since the last update, it no longer counts steps unless the main app is open. Used to work in the background, now appears to be working but count stays at 0 unless I open the app. Edit: developer's comment helped.

Christie,Functional,"I really like this app. It doesn't stress me to use it, or if I forget. It's just an easy background thing that I use to keep a track on walks I've done, when I remember, and I like the fact it counts my steps either way. My only criticism, is that my sister and I do the same walks and occasionally end up with different lengths at the end. But, I think that was the result of the settings and it seems to have stopped doing it so much now.",5.0
Mary Gonzales,Functional,This app was working great I really liked using it until today while out walking I had my phone in the back pocket of my jeans and some how it changed the language from English to something I don't know what it is I can't read it anymore and can not figure out how to change it back to English. Update. Thank you for getting back with me so fast. I was able to get the English back on.,5.0

marie montero,Functional,"This is by far the greatest step counting app I've downloaded by far. And it's actually absolutely free as advertised there's so many different features it's actually helped motivate me to walk because of their new GPS step counting.

They're so many other great features that come along with this app. Just try it",5.0
David Martin,Functional,"A nice simple stand alone app for counting my steps and distance walked that isn't made public (anti-Strava, if you will!). A nice bonus is that I can still get an approximate distance walked without having my location on, which I don't like keeping on permanently. I like that it's free, but I'll be willingly paying to have the ads removed.",5.0
Sherissa Goodson,Functional,"Literally, the best app for tracking my steps EVER! Google Fit is awful at tracking steps. It literally gets everystep. I can literally put my phone in my pocket while I work out and trust it will get all of my steps. Love that you can set goals on the app and it will remind you when you are near your goal. Keeps me going. Haven't figured out how to sync it with Google Fit yet, only because I can only use Google Fit on my phone. Hopefully, I can download this on my smartwatch soon!",5.0
bill warner,Functional,Got app in 2020. Worked great up until this year. The distance has seldom been accurate. I walk about 2X as far as the app states and will not allow me to edit the distance properly. It just keeps adding the amount I add instead of re-calibrating. Luckily I wear a standard pedometer as well. Got rid of app and will now log totals manually.,5.0
Brian Holmers,Functional,"So far so good! Much better than Samsung Health. I had to adjust the sensitivity so it didn't count the bumps on the road, while driving, as steps.

Laura Barfield,Functional,"Just got it literally yesterday so I really can't rate honestly until I've used the app for a few days.

One more doubt is about the step count, but I need to compare it with some other apps to give a clear picture.",5.0
Jaicee Lawal,Functional,"I've only been using it for a few days but it seems like a great app. Extremely easy to download and get started.

Could do with the app having the ability to synch with a weather tracker; nice that it tells you how long your jaunts take, and how many calories, but it might be better if it could take account of daily temperature. A five mile walk in 10- 15 degrees will burn calories at a different rate to the same walk in 25+ degrees. ðŸ™‚ Energy also proportionate to temperature, and you can't give us distances; all users legs aren't the same length.x",5.0
Cameron Lavallee,Functional,"I just started getting fit again yesterday and this really helps! It reminds you to drink water every day, it makes achievements that you want to earn later on which makes you more motivated. Love this app if I could rate this 6* I would!",5.0
Theresa Ristvedt,Functional,"I've tried different pedometer apps and ended up uninstalling because of various issues like not running (no pun intended), data lost, and s l o w processing. I didn't trust the step count either for those other apps; however I've had really solid experiences with this app! You can alter the sensitivity mode and I did several tests to see if the counter is accurate. So far, so excellent = game changer for this Grandma! â™¥ï¸",5.0
N Maser,Functional,"I've been using it for a week. Seems accurate. Calculates stride distance based on height and weight, but can be input manually. Manually input your daily step goal. Tracks walk/run workouts and automatically keeps a record of each, and of cumulative milestones.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,Doesn't force one to create an online account to hold personal information nor bombard one with ads. Easy to use but one thing that would be nice is to have option to turn off progress audio while in GPS mode. Took me a little while to figure how to change to metric units.,5.0
Lynn Walsh,Functional,"I normally use a pedometer to track how many steps I've completed whilst walking the dog. So today I downloaded this app and had it playing in the background whilst listening to music during my walk. Every 10 mins it overrides the music to give me a verbal notification of how far I've walked, how many calories I've burned and the speed I'm doing per mile. Although it doesn't take into account when I'm walking uphill (extra calories would be burned) I still found it a great motivator to do more!",5.0
Jill Killian,Functional,"So far, so good! I had checked to see if different movements would count and they do not. It keeps pretty accurate read of steps taken. I am waiting to see how having this app running in the background will play on battery drainage or if it inhibits use of other apps. So far, so good. Thank you for the help to a healthier lifestyle.",5.0
Metalguts,Functional,"Simple, easy and offline! Downloaded the app and then took a 7k walk. Worked perfectly! I like the fact that it will give you an approximate distance walked, even if the GPS is off. It would be nice if the app always auto updated the step count instead of sometimes waiting for me to unlock the screen.",5.0
Henry Fu,Functional,"1. The 'audio' that tracks on progress helps motivate users to achieve their goal. Perhaps, with more frequent trainer's 'words-of-encouragenent', it creates better interactivities. 2. The live GPS to track/record walking routes is like 'proof of achievement' when shared with others. Kudos.... thank you!",5.0
Celeste Austin,Functional,"Love it ðŸ˜Š. It has these great little reminders and encouragement to meet goals without being annoying. It has lots of features I didn't even realize it had. Fun surprises like when you get to the checkout counter and find out everything is half off, lol. I'm really getting into it and it's only been two days! Great app so far.",5.0
Serina Goodman,Functional,"You have officially lost a user. The last update has made a huge error in keeping track of the distance accurately. It jumps all over the place, too far in distance in a short period of time then jumps back to starting your distance when you've been at it for 20 mins. This is no longer a reliable app. Too bad you don't pay attention to your app. You can see comments explaining this app is having trouble and not running accurately, and you're not doing anything to rectify the problem.",1.0
spynylcracka,Functional,"The app is completely broken now. I have been using fit for over five years and everything worked except for the step counter which was way off. I used the app mainly to track distance, pace, miles, heart points and elevation. Now nothing is working correctly after the October update. The location tracking is completely broken as it now shows zig zags instead of straight lines for my route. It will even start subtracting distance, I don't understand how this is even possible.",1.0
Jennea V,Functional,"Keeps freezing. So frustrating. Also doesn't track walks on its own anymore, so have to go in deeper to see how many steps I took on my walk and total them myself. Every pause on my walk seems to think it needs to stop and restart tracking. It used to say ""morning walk"" and track the whole walk not stop tracking for every 2 seconds pause I take. Update 11/6/23: still freezing and not tracking steps or anything, just spinning wheel of death. Fix it.",1.0
Vassilios Gerousis,Functional,Latest version seems to be totally wrong on estimating activity metrics based on exercises. It stopped adding data metrics and then removed at the final results. This is annoying. Also the app to be very novice with latest Samsung watch. It does not use actual sensor data to calculate metrics. It seems that phone app is the main engine with less data and less reliable input. I hope you guys do a better job on the next version.,1.0
Jarrad Trythall,Functional,"This app worked perfectly on my Galaxy Watch 5. I've tried to do two walks/runs with it, and the GPS is all screwed up. I just did 4 miles in my neighborhood, and GPS shows me going around just our block for an hour and 15 minutes. ðŸ¤£ It sucks. Works perfectly on my phone, but then I can't track my heartrate. I guess I'll stick with Samsung Health. It even tracks my workouts when I forget to hit play!",1.0
Tony Murphy,Functional,"Displays a completely inaccurate step count even though it is supposedly syncing with my watch. As I'm writing this my watch shows 10,198 steps and Google fit shows 17,866. It's not even remotely close. It used to work correctly so I'm guessing it has to do with an update to Google Fit. It is super annoying, I wish the would fix it ASAP.",1.0
Daniel Erat,Functional,"Frustratingly buggy UI. Different parts of the interface are frequently out of sync: the step count usually doesn't match what's shown in the graph. Other times, the step count will stop updating entirely for minutes at a time and just fade in and out with no indication about what's happening. I suspect that Fit will be on the chopping block soon, like so many other niche Google products. That's a shame, since it seems like it could be a solid app if it got a bit more care.",1.0
S H,Functional,"This is the most frustrating app I've ever had to deal with. Not only is it inaccurate with step counting (by the thousands), but it consistently deletes steps as well. To the point where it feels hopeless to keep going to reach a goal because every time you get close, hundreds of steps disappear. I have no choice but to use this if I want to participate in the money back program through my insurance, but it's so awful that I may just give up on the program.",1.0
Mike Cebrian,Functional,"AVOID AVOID AVOID Since it was updated on July 20th, the app isn't accurately collecting data. Steps data reflects the information for a few seconds correctly, then the data disappears. If you select source data, it displays how many steps were taken correcty.

Denise Bosak,Functional,"App hardly tracks data, and when it does, it's still intermittent. I have attempted every fix suggested by Google and third parties (uninstalling the app, changing settings back and forth, updating app, etc.) And the app almost never tracks my activity. I started using a different app called Pedometer Step Counter and it tracks my activity accurately and reliably.",1.0
Alexey Dets,Functional,"Yet another stillborn Google app. If you're expecting something like Apple Health - don't, this app is not capable of syncing with anything useful - it doesn't sync with Garmin at all, it doesn't sync properly with Strava (only manually, after editing activity in Strava, and only some types of activities and only part of the data), it was not syncing with Fitbit while Fitbit was still a separate company etc. So, unless you use a Google Watch, this is just a piece of useless junk.",1.0
Kimberley Edwards,Functional,"I've used Google Fit as a step, workout, and heart point tracker for a couple years. In my experience, it had always been a bit frustrating, but after doing a factory reset on my phone, re-installing, and giving it every permission it requested, it's not working. It refuses to keep ""Track Activities"" and ""Use Location"" selected. I've uninstalled and re-installed. It was dodgy at best before. I was hoping that reinstalling on a reset phone it would be better. Instead it isn't working at all",1.0
Barak Nehoran,Functional,"Google Fit is the most bug-filled app I have ever seen Google produce. It has *serious* issues. There is a toggle for tracking my activity, but whenever I flip it, it immediately flips right back. What on earth? I tried contacting Google's customer support, but they couldn't help because they said that no one in customer support is familiar with Google Fit. Being able to turn on/off activity tracking is a crucial feature of the app, and it doesn't work and they don't seem to care.",1.0
Tom Robinson,Functional,"Doesn't track travelled route well. Shows corners cut through large (multi-block) buildings, fails to track accurate path even across miles of relatively open ground. Drops laps around a quarter mile track. It has always had a problem with this but recently it's grown much worse. It has also recently begun reducing mileage and heart points AFTER completion of a walk when even initial numbers were too low. I will actively begin searching for a fitness tracker that offers better performance.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Don't upgrade. This redesign sucks when it comes to accuracy and pretty much everything else. It doesn't accurately measure steps anymore and always seems to be subtracting them and it hasn't imported my Withings scale data since Sept 17th. I haven't seen Sleep As Android sync correctly with this new version. The journal also doesn't match the data on the home dashboard, so that's totally not confusing. ðŸ™„ It's difficult to navigate if you're used to detailed information like the previous app version had, lord help me if I ever need to edit an automatically tracked activity in here from like bike to walk, it seems like it's going to be a giant headache. Finally, the heart points are stupid. This new paradigm is vague and confusing and maybe if it was used anywhere else it would be helpful but right now it feels like you earn these mysterious points for doing who knows what, and that's if the app even tracks it correctly. Then it chastises you for not meeting this goal of weird points and makes you lower it so you can feel extra bad about yourself. What would have been helpful are notifications that tell you when you've been sitting too long or haven't walked enough. Or maybe like meditation or breathing exercises. But as it is right now, it looks pretty but it's a giant pain in the butt.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"With the upgrade, the widget for registering your weight is easier to use.  Or would be, except that the font has shrunk to the point where I can no longer read it.  It could really stand to go back to its old size.  Or at least be made adjustable.  The app itself only works part of the time.  Actually, I believe that it continues to count steps.  But the UI often freezes and will not update, so you can't see your progress.  When this happens I've tried force-closing the app and even cycling power on my device.  But I've found that the only way to wake it up is to go home and turn wifi on.  Then the UI will finally update.  But this defeats its whole purpose, since you can only see whether you've achieved your goal in exercise by stopping exercise.  Giving up.  It's simply stopped working without a data connection.  Which makes it useless.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's amazing to me that Google can't seem to make an app that syncs properly with the phone and a wear watch. Constantly having to manually edit the number of steps. If the battery dies on the watch it will not always sync correctly when you restart it. You have to go in and estimate your fitness data and enter it manually because it syncs typically a much lower with step tracking. If you walk away from the phone with your watch on when you come back, sync is way off and it's getting worse.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"I used to love this app. It worked great, encouraged me to move around more at work, and even helped me progress in Pokemon GO. Unfortunately, it broke sometime in the last week. It tracks nothing. It has lost track of all recorded data since mid-May. Any attempt to start a workout hangs indefinitely and fails. Any attempt to change a setting in-app loads infinitely, then fails. The pop-up menus don't work. When I tried a reinstall, I couldn't login with my normal account at all. Fix it Google",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"The old google fit prior to the recent revamp was great.  It was reliable, easy to figure out, and tracked information I was interested in, such as changes of elevation on my walks.  Also looked nice.  The new version stinks.  It frequently won't start at all, it doesn't track my route consistently - sometimes the route it tracks looks like the GPS system is wobbling!  And sometimes it won't find me at all, though I'm starting from the same place every single day.  Lots of problems, including that it put my photo on the start page, which is NOT something I want and can't get rid of.  I don't like that kind of invasiveness.  PLEASE bring back the old Fit for those of us unhappy with the new one!  There is not one feature of the new that I want, and I do want features of the old one back.  Guess I have to ""edit"" this review rather than write a new one.  I've uninstalled Google Fit because it's not fit to be on my phone.  The latest problems include draining my battery by continuing to run in the background after I've turned it off, and NOT running to track my activity when I tell it to.  Since you can't be bothered to provide the option of the old system, it's history.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"In the old version I could use this app to track all of my calories burned as well as stay motivated. It would sometimes count being stuck in traffic as bike riding, but overall a close enough approximation of my work over time. A little slow to load, but used it for over a year. With the current update, it has become an abomination of all the worst elements of gamification. Meaningless point economy that overtakes the above the fold UX. Now this app has motivated me to go somewhere else.",1.0

I've had the app for over a month now and a) I'm frustrated that it's not compatible with my Fitbit and b) frustrated that there's no way to add exercises. It lets you modify exercises but won't let you save it if it thinks it's ""too high"". I went for a 5 mile run last night and had about 12,000 steps, but the app only counted 283 somehow.

In the end Google registered two walks. One for seven minutes and the other for 11 mins. Sigh. 2. When selecting an activity you have to manually scroll to select the type. Booo, this can easily be updated to make searching more efficient, come on Google! 3. It is sometimes nonexistant to edit a workout. Overall a horrible interface.",1.0
Mel Marrero,Functional,This app is terrible at syncing data properly. I often find random activities that I did not perform that bump up my active minutes. I have to delete them almost daily. I'm not sure if there's an issue with the security or what is causing the glitch but it's incredibly frustrating. I would not recommend this. Unfortunately there are no other options for syncing data to Stridekick for fitness challenges with the type of smartwatch and phone that I have. I wish they had customer service to help.,1.0
James Kibler,Functional,"This is the worst app ever. It used to be great, but systematically lost all useful features. There is no elevation tracking. You can't keep your screen on (locked on) during workouts. Once the screen sleeps, you can't see your workout timer in notifications. It tracks some ridiculous thing called heart points. There are no useful settings--100% of the previous used to be and/or should be set by the user. I hate this app, primarily because it was so much better ~4; years ago.",1.0
Patrick Whittle,Functional,"After the next-to-last update, the app has started to ignore entire long walks in measuring step counts, etc. For example, yesterday I took three different walks, each of over a half-mile, but the journal recognized only the first of them. All settings appear to be normal so it appears that the app has gone kablooie. UPDATE: Thanks, but I had already read the article and all the settings were already as recommended. As other reviews make clear, this problem is not device-dependent.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app is T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E! The who purpose of it is to track your fitness in order to achieve a certain goal. The ""move minutes"" and ""heart points"" disappear after you've already earned them. This doesn't happen sporadically, it happens every single day. I've since downloaded the ""Samsung Health"" fitness app and I've experienced no problems at all. I like the platform of ""Google Fit"", but it definitely needs to be fixed to improve reliability. My opinion...... DON'T BOTHER DOWNLOADING!!!",1.0
Victoria Iyere,Functional,Its so buggy. Suddenly my steps and heart points are saying 0 yet when I go into steps they are there. I use this to sync everything for an important health program and its very important that it is accurate and it throws off my results and progress tracking. I can't even delete incorrect weights and it syncs them wrong. March 1 shows up in the february week and won't even change when I edit it. Showing gain when there was loss. Its all messed up and these updates don't fix anything.,1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Yeah, I really loved Google Fit before this redesign. Now the app is basic, and lost alot of its functionality. For instance you could separate the data, so that you could see when you biked or walked or ran. You could track your heart rate not these ""heart points"". I wish the play store had some way to download older versions of apps because this one is so much of a dud, I had to uninstall Fit.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've had issues getting the app to work since the first time i tried to use it (over a year). it NEVER syncs to my watch. in the last couple of days it stopped tracking anything, wouldn't register, just looked like it was trying to load. i uninstalled and reinstalled and now it won't let me log in, says doesn't recognize account. very disappointing.",1.0
Usman Javed Bhatti,Functional,"The most useful feature of activity detection and rep counts has been removed. Without it the new app is practically useless. The new simplified design has been over simplified that it's no longer useful in displaying even the basic information when walking or cycling. Lastly the calorie counter is extremely unreliable, if you put activity to strength training and just sit and do nothing, the calories keep going up at the same rate. I hope they fix this and bring back the activity detection.",1.0
Glenn Kettler,Functional,"Your app has changed drastically, steps, distances. Not accurate anymore at all. Been using you for well as long as I can remember. And it's just occured in the last few weeks to a month. I use it every single day. Always update it.

It once was a great fitness app, not so much anymore.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"This redesign did nothing but dumb down the app and remove a whole bunch of useful features. This app is currently only good for tracking your step goals and heart Point goals. Can't even see previous days or a summary of your week/month/year. Syncing with 3rd party apps is also very finicky. It does not get heart rate data at all from Huawei bands and doesn't sync all heart rate data from Notify (Mi Band). In the case of the latter, it only provides snippets of data, sometimes only once a day.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"The new update is really uninformational. The hexagon graphic takes up most of the landing page and is absolutely useless.

I miss the useful content and efficiency of the old app.",1.0
Dad Life,Functional,Extremely glitchy. It removes certain workouts when I add more than three in one day. And even though I am adding the time it's still screws it up. For example I put in from 8:00 to 8:30 and it counts it as 1 hour. This has gone from an okay fitness app to absolutely unusable. There are so many things wrong with this app that I have to uninstall it. It has recently been updated and it keeps getting worse.,1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Automatic activity tracking is broken at the moment. Used to have no problems while phone was in my pocket to pick up on walks (treadmill or outside).

And again, over a week ago it did without issues. I haven't updated or changed any phone settings.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"The recent changes have made the app pretty terrible. I do the same walk everyday, and the steps and miles are never consistent according to this app. It works poorly with MyFitnessPal, which seems to think I'm walking while pushing a wheelchair.

Pikey F,Functional,"Not a really serious fitness app. While it can track a range of sports, it fails to track swimming beyond basic time in the water. There is not an option to enter distance swam and it does not track distance either. Thus there is no measure of effort expended. If you floated in the water for 30 minutes or put up a world record time, Google Fit would treat them the same. This is a major deficiency to the app.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,This doesnt interact properly with watch version of the app. It detects activity when none is present: calls a drive to the store a walk for example (@ ludicrous speeds). You cant edit or adjust the data and when you try to delete entries they stay put. It can detect 24+ hours of aerobics and congratulates you for forgetting to turn it off. All these issues make this app beyond useless and in the realm of just plain annoying.,1.0
Dee Garkie,Functional,"Wildly inaccurate and un-usable. Will measure 6k steps while I'm at work sitting at a desk, and there is no easy way to turn this off while not in use. you have to manually disable all permissions after your workout and then re-enable it before your workout.

Laura McElhinney,Functional,"I used to love this app. It connects to so many different apps - it was my central hub. Now it very rarely syncs my steps, so my weightloss app thinks I'm not walking.

A Google user,Functional,"Google fit use to be a great app. With the big update earlier this year the app is now useless. I can go on a run using another app and it shows an accurate mileage while fit says I went half the distance. If I look at the map that fit provides it shows a path I did not take. The most frustrating part is the apps are set up to share data and they don't.  Edit: Setting my height and weight is not the solution.  Again I use another tracker when I run and it shows the correct path that I ran, fit shows a very odd path where i cut corner and miss complete parts of my run.  Yesterday I went for a 3.5 mile run and fit showed it as 1.2 miles.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,The loss of features with the latest big update is inexcusable. We used to be able to *choose* what we wanted to set as our goals and what we cared most about in terms of our health. Now we are forced to use the move minutes nonsense. I am actively trying to *gain* weight and I don't care at all about steps and cardio. I care about strength workouts and calories. Now I'm trying to figure out what alternatives exist aside from Google for fitness tracking because it's become completely useless.,1.0
Cynthia Chou,Functional,"I really wanted to use this app to store all my health information. However it is not very friendly in regards to the menstrual tracking portions. At the moment, it does not allow updates to existing menstrual entries. The only way information can be modified is by deleting all data completely!

I'm really disappointed.",1.0
Scott Dickinson,Functional,3-12-2021. And you broke the app again. It's sees the heart points but the gauge shows 0. Please fix Pros: Easy to use and able to track a wide variety of activities.

Elliander Eldridge,Functional,"This app has a major problem: There is absolutely no way to correct a typo. If you enter a bad data point for a body measurement you can enter a new value afterwards, but the old value will remain in history permanently. If you make the new data value for the same date and time it will show that as your current measurement, but it won't record it in history at all. The only way to fix a typo is to delete all history for that measurement, which is a bit like if Google made us delete entire documents to fix a typo on Google Sheets. You'd then have to go in and enter all the data points again manually for the entire history and hope you don't get another typo. If you need to clear the data again you will first have to clear data for the app in Android settings. If that's not bad enough you can't access the data from a web browser to save it so you will need to keep your data history recorded somewhere else to fix errors if and when they occur. A data entry app that doesn't let users fix typos is of limited usefulness. There's no way to report bugs and Google One support can only read you what is on a single help page which isn't much. Oh, and there's also no way to accurately record BMI. That requires a whole number, but my Doctor's office records to two decimal places. And for tracking steps, I counted my steps while holding the device and it did not record them properly. That said, if you don't care about storing accurate data, the app is great! Nice user interface. Although personally I'd prefer functionality over look and feel.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,It appears there's a glitch in the software. I decided to install Google Fit and sync my watch app with it. Well the Move and Heart minutes were correct for about 45 minutes then poof only a few minutes remained. The Journal showes my data though. I spent too long trying to figure out what happened. It appears I am not alone. Someone at Google needs to fix the code.,1.0
A Google user,Functional,"So far it's useless due to the error that apparently many are getting - ""Cant verify your account. Check your internet connection.""  I've tried installing this on a Galaxy S9+ as well as a Chromebook using standard Google accounts, but get this error no matter the device.  I think it's a glitch with Google's account system.  For some people it's started to work again, but obviously not for others.  Very annoying.  This has been going on for at least a week if not more according to reports I've seen, you would think they would have prioritizing fixing a bug that prevents people from using the app at all, but I guess Google Fit is not a high priority for Google. :(",1.0
Jarrod Martin,Functional,"terrible interface. not many options for editing, tracking fitness. the app on my watch is in a constant loop asking for permissions and information which is already available in my Google Fit account like weight and height. seems like there are too many broken seams. this app has never been able to deliver a good user experience and i don't expect that to change. also, Android Wear devices do not properly sync data with Fit.",1.0
Gannon Mendez,Functional,Update ** - Got the s22 Ultra and installed this app again to see how it works. This time it completely misses the accuracy of my walks. It shows me walking through homes instead of on the streets on my 2 mile walk. Plus I can't turn off my walk until hours after I'm done. Why can't this be updated to work??? It doesn't track my walking accurately. It is consistently off everyday on my steps and on the map. Love the app but since the last update I've had this issue. Hope it can be fixed.,1.0
Thal Wright,Functional,Too bad this app really is not functional. I don't understand how it can subtract steps. I literally was looking at it when my step count decreased by 100. Very inconsistent and unreliable. There are so many other versions. Go elsewhere if you are looking for reliable and consistent. And yes I will get the automated thanks for your feedback response.,1.0
Skylar Fitzwater,Functional,"I hate you can't edit a workout when it records the wrong data, for instance the amount of time of a workout. I accidentally recorded 1hr 14 minutes on elliptical (Bowflex Max Machine) when I meant to record only 14 minutes and there's no way to delete it now. Really sucks there is no user control if google fit syncs with a third party app. Fitbit and the others don't seem to have an issue syncing with many apps and watches so what's up google?",1.0

I get to setting the move minutes and cannot advance through the setup. Was there a recent update? I have a pixel, so i figured it should be pretty seamless... Auto tracking is not the issue I am writing about. When I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, I am unable to get past the initial info. The tracking issue started on 2/19.",1.0
Jerry T,Functional,"The activity journal is very buggy and you can't stop it at the end of your activity! It's also logging your activity when you definitely weren't doing any and counted a drive - oh, and I didn't activate the journal. I'll start the tracker when I go for a walk or a jog and sometimes take it out during a walk to check the distance. It usually works during the walk or jog. However, when I'm actually done I will go to stop and the pause/stop isn't available; it's on the main Journal page. I go do other things and the next day (or later) I open the app and there's the pause/stop view; the activity journal is still going and it says I've been walking for 16+ hours!! I moved to another state recently and the activity monitor appeared when I re-opened the app after several weeks. The activity was running (pause/stop options) and said I did a ""lunch hike"" for 41 miles and 113,500 steps over a period of over three weeks; from the middle of one month into the early part of the next month. Really?!?!?!? In one case I edited the end time and tracker was still running, though after stopping the activity and re-opening the app the summary was corrected. This happens the majority of the time.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"It used to be pretty good. The ""update"" was really a downgrade. The data isn't presented very clean, sleep data was removed from view. It just takes too many clicks to get the information you're looking for. There isn't a good way to compare your current level with your previous level... just bad design all around.",1.0
Dan Corby,Functional,No longer tracks workouts. I'll add one and it'll start. The the notification disappears when I go back to check it. Within the app the workout is gone. A day or days later I'll open the app and it will have that workout magically pop up. It's been tracking the whole time. Wish I could actually use it! It used to work.,1.0
Charlie Warner,Functional,Steps tracking is broken. Individual activities are being tracked and can still be viewed under the details page. But the big circle on the home page that shows your progress for the day is just stuck at zero. It occasionally flashes the number for a quarter second when reopening the app and then goes back to zero. I'm not going to go add up 12 numbers over and over again to figure out how many steps I'm getting in the day...,1.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app has turned into complete garbage. It used to be great, and it still tracks your steps. However it now does not track workouts correctly. When you start a workout to track it often just disappers after 5 or 10 minutes. You can then add it manually, however when you add a 2nd workout activity for the day the first one disappers. Virtually worthless for tracking actual workouts. Seems now their focus is just more accurate location based and step data to tie togwther for maps and ads. Sad.",1.0
Nina Melita,Functional,"Doesn't track steps, route and miles correctly. I walk over 5 miles every day. Fit never tracks it correctly, missing most of the route and steps. Today was the worst it told me I walked .07 miles in 1hr 50min and took 2000 steps. Looking at the route it misses most of it with a straight line between a few points. App is useless. I have samsung health on my phone as well and it gets it right every time so it is definitely an app issue.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,I find it poorly designed and useless as a fitness tracker for a long time fitness athlete it seems to be designed as a gimmick rather than a serious tracking tool.

Nathan Sanders,Functional,"When it works it's great. The problem is as of recently it rarely works. Heart points consistently disappear through out the day.

Everything is set correctly but still doesn't work at all...I have done all the trouble shooting that was shown and the app still doesn't work even had a phone tech look at it. This app needs a new update to fix the tracking issue. If you guys actually read the latest reviews for this app we are all saying the same thing it doesn't work. Don't send me a computer based response just.,1.0
A Google user,Functional,Looks nice but that's about it. It tracks while you drive. Can't enter seconds in manual workouts. Had to go back and make this 1 star. Would make it zero if I could. Can't edit your workouts in a meaningful manner. Treadmill workout just runs and tries to track even if you don't have it on your body. Problem is you can't go back and edit the distance. Who designed and tested this?,1.0
Jason McMurray,Functional,"It only adds my steps and information once every week or two for some reason. Very unreliable. In response to Google response: first off, the ""Profile"" tab doesn't even have the ""Help"" option. I think you mean to go to the ""Settings"" tab. Second, what am I supposed to submit? Basically the same thing I said in this review, that it only logs about 1 of every 5 days or so? This shows that my settings are turned on, but it just doesn't give data for the majority of the time.",1.0
Michael,Functional,"Complete garbage. The option to change measurement units is either very well hidden or doesn't exist at all. That's as far as I got.

The calorie counts are totally off even though I put my data in. Now it also started tracking a bike ride while I was at home and didn't touch my phone. SUPER disappointed in this :( will download a different ap",1.0
A Google user,Functional,Won't let me start a work out when I'm offline. I have disabled GPS access for Fit so it shouldn't need to be on a network to count my steps. The app should just save the data on device storage and sync it later but it doesn't. I've also had several problems syncing with other apps since the last update. I do a lot of walking at work but because I'm in the same building all day PokÃ©mon GO's distance walked stats don't do much and I've relied on Adventure Sync to hatch eggs via Fit stats.,1.0

A Google user,Functional,"I just started using this app specifically because it tracked minutes of activity rather than steps. It was the perfect alternative to Fitbit for someone recovering from a foot injury who can't walk as much. But now they changed it to track steps instead!

A Google user,Functional,"I started using Google Fit about 2 years ago, and one of the features I quite liked was that it presented your route, showing it on a map and even (If I remember right) color coding your walking or running speed.  I moved last year, and was pleased to see it could ALSO show you elevation changes, so I could see how many hills I was going up or down, and at what points.  THEN... it got a big update and redesign.  Now, there are no maps, and half the features are gone.

At the end of the hike discovered the app stopped recording after I'd looked at the journal. BAD! I don't have any other gadgets that interface with this app; if you do, it may be a better fit for you. For me, I want to know distance and also elevation and a good map, etc. The strava app is great for this.

If it would connect with Garmin or Strava and add those steps, that would be outstanding! In the mean time, it does not really help. Good thought though!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app has been simplified to the point that it's barely even functional anymore. I can't disable the automatic tracking that thinks I'm walking when I get stuck in traffic (the article says it should be in the settings, but it isn't), I can't edit a journal entry to change the intensity, I can't set long term goals. Looking for something else now.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I loved the old version of Google fit, but the new one is so limited in its features. You can't access half the stats you used to be able to, step count is no longer a forefront feature, and it sends you judgy notifications when you miss a week because you're busy. No, I don't want to adjust my goals! Bring back the old version, it was so much better!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I used to be a big fan of the app but it got redesigned in 2018 and became much less usable. It used to easily and at a glance show steps, you could manually log workouts too or recatagorise if it read an activity wrong. Best of all it had a log to see past day/week/month stats. Now it's not easy to tell what it's tracking and it's impossible to look at historical data.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"So disappointing. Not great to navigate. Forces seemingly arbitrary metrics on you, like heart points and move minutes, which are poorly defined and are of no interest to me as a result. It doesn't seem to be able to accurately measure basic things, like steps, so I really don't even trust the app anymore. Flipping from day to day to see history is not intuitive. The one thing I like is that it captures data from other apps. Overall Google has truly overcomplicated what used to be a good app.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,Sync not accurate. For some reason every time I work out in the morning Google fit on my watch recordes way more activity than my phone does. And the two devices are not that far apart from each other with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth being able to be connected. I've tried to troubleshoot the issue on Google's forums and I still can't fix the problem. I wouldn't mind but the difference in numbers is quite significant. 40 move mins versus 20 and it's a little aggravating.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I'm kind of disappointed with the performance of this app. It worked fine in the beginning, but several times I've opened it to find that it hasn't been tracking my steps, nothing but a big fat ""0 steps"". Restarting the app doesn't help, only after to uninstalling and reinstalling did tracking resume. I don't think it's unrealistic to expect better from Google, especially when most Google apps/products work excellently.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,It's nice to feel good. That's about it. Changed phones and no way to transfer my history to continue to track. Basically like starting completely over. Limited windows for you to review graphs. Bubble graph automatically for month. No month to month tracking. I could go on and on. Nice week visual that's about it in a nutshell.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Doesn't work well; I used it with Wear OS. Went for a five miles run and it recorded that I spent ONE (1) calories !!! This has happened several times. It should check that if one has spent 47 minutes covering five miles, it is impossible to have spent only one calories. Also, when I ride a bike and have my phone with me, it says it gets the GPS from my phone, but it doesn't record the distance, or anything, just the time. The old version one could edit the data when it was incorrect, but with this version only the title can be edited. If the data is wrong, one should be able to correct it.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"the app is fine. user interface is easy. my biggest issue is that it does not take any of the information from my steel hr nokia smartwatch. it claims to and yet I can have thousands of steps from my watch and 100 on the app from the few times I had my phone on person while walking. This has been a frustrating issue and hasn't been fixed. I do a ton of walking at work and cant have my phone on me. I tried sending an email but their support email doesn't work. I'd like to see change, I'd be happy.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Fit eats my miles. This bike ride was at least 8 miles round-trip. Halfway through, it said 4.28 miles and actually had a little extra track. By the time I'm back to where I started, it says 2 miles. There's some overlap on the route, bit this is so far off, it becomes worthless as a fitness tracker. You guys need to improve tracking. Location services and data are all enabled. The track on the map is mostly accurate. But the total miles are only a quarter of what I rode.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I'd gladly give it 5 stars, because it used to be an amazing app! However, this latest update has ruined it. Please make it we can log in and sync all of our stuff again!! I took a screen shot if where it gets stuck but I'm not able to upload it here. I'll gladly email it. I've already done the feedback option in the app as well. Not sure where the bug is but I hope it gets fixed because it has not tracked anything done me since 28 July 2019.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"No clear purpose for this app. Never mind that it's got it's share if bugs, there's no clear purpose for this. You get the number of minutes you moved, and number of steps. That it. Even after you connect your workout and sleep apps, you don't see that relevant data reported. You still have to go to each individual app for analysis. So you enter a bunch of data that you can't analyze, can't download, can't edit. Why?",2.0
Zack S,Functional,"Please fix the glitching, or app is useless. I've been using this app for months now for hiking, walking, swimming, etc. and haven't had any issues. Recently, while hiking, I will go to check my progress in the app, and all I see is a loading wheel as if the app has lost connection. By the time I finish my hike, the majority of my activity has not even been recorded, which means that the information is not accurate. Please fix this issue, or I will have to uninstall permanently.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"The heart points are arbitrary and i dont see the point. i would just like a clear log of my steps and distance. I find myself adding up the distances of all the separate walks i take to get my total mileage for the day. the interface isn't intuitive, and i can't go back and look at a simple history without an itemized log. very disappointing.",2.0
Jen B,Functional,"It WAS decent, but not perfect (it always seriously underestimated my distance when I went for a run, but I have a Garmin for that). However, it has now stopped working properly. It displays my step count and heart points as zero, no matter how many steps I've actually walked/run. I've tried clearing the cache, clearing the data, uninstalling and reinstalling, rebooting my phone, all to no avail. Based on comments on the Google Community Help page, I'm not the only one with this issue. I'll change my review if/when this issue is fixed.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"The new ""improvements"" are inaccurate. Plus you can no longer add fitness goals and if you erase old goals you can't get them back. Good for have an idea of how much you've walked but it's glitchy and will change your stats for no reason. Example today i walked .48 miles around a store but now it says ""0"" miles but it still shows the time. Also fails to register all of your steps. The old design was much more accurate.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"When the app works, it's great. But when it doesn't work, boy oh boy does it not work. Can't even log in, can't access my account in any way, won't track any of my information, and there seems to be 0 way to fix it until it randomly fixed itself. Have had this problem twice and there seems to be nothing I can do. Have sent reports to Google multiple times, still no fix. No excuse for this!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"occasionally this app stops tracking steps and distance, even when you turn on the run tracking. Clearing the cache and making sure that storage rights are enabled usually fixes the problem. However, after this most recent update (where they introduced elevation change) it doesn't track at all anymore. It's so inconsistent that I will probably switch to a different app soon.",2.0
Stephanie S,Functional,"Recently I've become frustrated with this First of all, if you click off the tracking, it disappears and you have to go through all the steps to find it again as I'd you were first starting it. It would be nice to have it on the lock screen. Second, I've noticed when tracking, it will give me one mileage, but later when I check, it will be less. And today I wanted to run 4 miles. When I looked, it said 3.75. I looked a few mins later and it said 3.46. super frustrating.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I used to really like this app until it was updated. The heart points are stupid. The move minutes are stupid. I can track my steps and types of workout, great. But while it has a journal that individually lists every walk I've taken, I can't see monthly or yearly progress, and it only shows me the steps I've done that week. This update blows.",2.0
M M,Functional,"When it works, it's great. But despite my having a Pixel, the app suddenly stops working regularly for a bit of time. The past two days, it is tracking but the interface keeps resetting to zero, so I get constant messages of hitting my goals as it keeps going back to zero then back to my progress, etc. At times it would stop tracking steps for a week or so, then stops calculating distance. Given this is Google on a Google product, I would expect a higher level of stability.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I'm giving up and uninstalling Fit. After the recent major overhaul of the app, the activity tracker has been wildly inaccurate. For example, it now always interprets my commute of a block of walking, then standing in place for five minutes at the bus stop, then riding a bus for ten minutes moving well above walking speed, then walking two blocks as 20+ minutes of walking. And then other times when I've walked, it thinks I haven't moved. And unlike the previous version, I can't go into the activity and edit it to the correct distance walked and time it took. I'm using a Google phone, and Google Fit doesn't work on it. Ridiculous.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app is inaccurate (steps counter) and has gross inconsistencies on distances. For example, it correctly tracked my 13k steps and initially told me I walked 5.5 miles (roughly accurate). An hour later I have more steps and the distance shows a total of .47 miles. I restarted my phone and force stopped the app, and it says the same. The app gives you no option to give feedback to Google whatsoever, so they can't/won't help debug it.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,The old version was great. And the new version is ok at best. There is a fatal flaw that I have run into time and time again. If you are in an area of no to little service then you can't start your workout. No idea why it needs a data connection to start but it does. The second issue is a pain but not deal breaking. The new app does not allow you to open and zoom in on the map of your workout. You just get an overview. I want to see where I went when hiking cross country.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"The original app was way better. It was simple enough but allowed customization of goals based on the USERS goals (number of steps, miles, minutes etc.) Now you can only set goals for minutes and the heart association's ""heart points"". That may be ok if you're setting new basic goals, but this app was much more useful before. I love Google products in general, so this is a let down.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,Was working great the first few months and then suddenly the past few days it doesn't track my steps correctly; and none of the settings and permissions for the app were changed to cause this. I walk at least 2 miles a day due to work and it only records around 0.7 of a mile now. The averages for each day used to be around the same but now it varies drastically.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Latest update is garbage! It no longer tracks workouts correctly, and the time is a pain to input if you're just trying to enter the number of minutes, it now requires that you must enter a start time and a stop time. If you don't do this as soon as you're done it requires unnecessary math, whereas it used to require just inputting the minutes. If you workout more than once, it doesn't accurately account for each workout. I used to love this app, as a way to track my average mph but this recent update is a huge step backwards.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,I used to use iPhone all the time including my iwatch but my husband and i switched to Google Pixel and i now have a ticwatch. My biggest complaint in switching has been fitness tracking. Using this app is so inaccurate. I can't trust the tracker in this app at all. I will go on a 3 mile hike and it will say I've only gone 1.7 miles. I'll go on a 4 mile run and it will say 2.2 miles. I don't even use it to try and keep track because I'm so frustrated with the inaccuracy. Its also very slow start,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"10/10/19: Data that was randomly deleted eventually returned. Apparently, the update caused a hiccup that was resolved. The app is decent when it is working properly. The problem is that it will retroactively remove distance at random. Given that I must use this app to support a different app, it becomes a big hassle when it reduces the distance walked. Additionally, there is no support for checking your walking distance in kilometers instead of miles, which is a disappointment.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app has good features, if they would work the way they should. The distance counter is inaccurate, the step counter doesn't update quickly enough at all, and I have tracked walking with the activity tracker, will go to end the walk with a set amount of miles (ex. 2.53 miles shown that I've walked) and when I end the walk it will randomly reduce the amount of miles or steps traveled (ex. 2.42). It clearly has some bugs and doesn't utilize the phone properly in its tracking.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Not too bad of an app. One bad thing I'm not a fan of, is that at the end of the day it does not show the total steps in the 'Journal' summary. It is only showing the ""activities"" that it auto tracks. I have my phone in my side pocket while I'm moving about during my shift. It would be nice to see a ""Total Steps,"" Calories, and total miles, in addition to the move minutes, and heart points in the journal. It already does this in the ""Home"" screen, just below the profile picture. Why can't it show the same data in the one-line history in the Journal?",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Older version worked pretty well, but the newer version with the Heart Points (whatever that means) is a big step backwards. Basic features no longer work: activity tracking is terrible - half the time is cannot start or stop activity tracking so info is completely inaccurate, the app is horribly slow to respond - freezes regularly and sometimes takes minutes to respond, adding or deleting activities completely confuses it. Wish I could go back to the previous version since it had some nice features and actually worked most of the time.   Got so frustrated I downloaded Samsung Health and that app works great. I have a Pixel phone, and its frustrating that the Google app works so poorly with the Google phone. Please fix it.",2.0
Mark Faine,Functional,"I like that it is free but that's about all of the pros. As for cons, you have to have your phone on you at all times unless you are linking a device, at which point you'd probably be using the device's app. How it's held/worn seems to change tracking accuracy. The step count is wildly inaccurate. The app under counts drastically on the treadmill and over counts a bit when walking on pavement. There is no way to modify the stride length or do any sort of calibration",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Google failing once again. Breaking previously perfect functionality all for a UI redesign to copy Apple's. This app used to be very precise in tracking steps and distance. Now I'm only able to view steps and I'm unable to set new goals because the set goal button does absolutely nothing. What's worse is that you're unable to view history for individual days, only for stretches of several days. . . otherwise you get that annoying moving wave animation. Great job on that placeholder for broken functionality!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I constantly have issues with this app. After a few weeks, it completely stops tracking steps. I've done all of the troupleshooting steps suggested and I still have issues with this app not working the way it is supposed to after a few weeks. I basically just uninstall then reinstall the app... you lose all your progress when you do this, but at least I can get it to work for a few more weeks. :/ really wish they would fix this app. I love Google products, but this one is lacking.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really loved the old Google fit. The recent update eliminated many of the useful features I liked. (i.e. doesn't call out pace anymore on runs, can't modify a tracked run for time or distance if the logging is wrong). The new features like heart and move minutes are useless. Don't like the new version at all. Time to go back to the drawing board Google. You screwed up a great app.",2.0
Travis Mesologites,Functional,"This app needs a major design overhaul. It has the absolute basics and can only show the data, but not allow you to edit or delete incorrect entries that were imported (you can't even edit the dashboard). I only use it as a link-aggregator between apps so my weight and steps data is transferred from one third-party program to another. I have also sent feedback and never receive acknowledgment.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"This really is not a very good app. Very confusing interface. The app tracks well but very hard to see good info in app. For example, still have not found a view for calories burned per day. Also, very clunky to switch days when viewing day stats. Should be able to slide left or right to view days instead of tapping a small right left arrow. I liked the Moves app MUCH better but sadly Facebook canceled it.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,Update: bring back custom goals please. The removal of these is very disappointing and makes me want to seek alternatives. Great app! I would like to have a widget to start/stop activity tracking. Hoping to see more developers integrate with it. I would also like to see elevation change in hikes and included in calorie calculation (maybe integrate with All Trails for some of that). Updates: love the inclusion of elevation,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app is nice and basic and looks good. But that's it. I have it linked to my device and it's syncing something, cut only about a quarter of my steps. It's very consistent about it. It's never matched anywhere near my actual step count. That's a bummer because my tracker is supposed to sync to Google, which will sync to my food tracker. Instead I'll just have to track things manually in the food app. Without that Fit is kinda useless. And yes, I left feedback through the app.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app creates bogus log entries & you can't delete some of them. For example, I entered my weight for yesterday morning & later found two other (incorrect) entries logged for that afternoon. Then, my phone was sitting on my nightstand charging last night when the app created an entry saying I went for a 5-minute walk (???). It would be great if the app worked, but I can't use it in its current condition. Deleting.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"It won't let me edit journal data that is automatically imported from mi fitness app. Manual journal entry also doesn't show up any more if it is in the same period tracked by other apps.

Clearly Google hasn't thought through how to present the data in a meaningful way.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"The GPS and distance tracking is some of the worst I've ever seen. I watched my distance tonight jump from 1.5 miles to 1.2 miles, while the number of steps increased.

Yohance Trice,Functional,This app used to be better but lately it seems to be getting worse. It no longer wants to track the minutes I spend exercising. I just went on at least a 20 minute walk which even my old outdated pedometer was able to pick up . Yet Google Fit failed. Update July 8 2023 It has gotten even worse since last year. As others have said it no longer tracks activity. I walked back and forth in the house for at least 10 mins and it picked up nothing. Also as someone else said Fit is very buggy.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"It would be great if it worked right.  Today, I took my 2-mile fitness walk.  Fit reported 1.08 miles, and the map of my ""morning walk"" was completely wrong.  This is on a Pixel 3, Google's ""flagship"" phone.   Fit used to work much better.  I don't know if it was the Android 9 update that broke it, but the app is useless if the collected data is junk.",2.0
Anne Griffin,Functional,"I actually liked this little app but sadly it no longer works and does not show step count or heart points anymore. The numbers flash for a fraction of a second when you open the app but then just reverts to zeros.

A Google user,Functional,"I appreciate that you refreshed this app, but at this point I don't see value. The app shows some steps data, but I can't drill down or even get a reading of the exact number of steps per day. I can't see information beyond a week.

George Young,Functional,"The accuracy for steps seems to be way off. The app only counts the side of the body the phone is on.

So far, I have not met any of the goals since the beginning. I think the app needs better accuracy data.",2.0

I've tried booting one device then the next, most of the usual fixes. Currently giving it another chance. But if it doesn't work then I just have to use another app.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,Android 10 seems to have ruined this app along with other things. I used to love this app it was very accurate and reliable.

Also hope they fix the fact you cant sync music playlists since the 10 update but that's besides the point.,2.0
Marcin Sieniek,Functional,"Disappointing for a Google app. Barebones activity tracking with no Google magic. I wish it automatically detected when I was active, paused when I was not, trimmed the time when I was driving and forgot to turn it off.

Still a piece of junk. will not sync with mi fit or endomondo. it says that they are connected. used it to day for my morning walk. map out my route okay. yet it did not give the distance traveled or steps. need to go back to the drawing board.it still does not sync like it should. Just tried it and it crashed. I deleted it. It would not sync. I had to unlink it and relink it. To get it to sync and even then it would not always sync,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I used to love Google Fit and it was my go to app for tracking steps and other activities. However, for some time now it seems like it has bene declining steadily. First it stopped tracking from some other apps, then it became much slower and now it simply won't let me do anything - it won't show my steps on the journal my activities, won't let me log an activity and won't let me start tracking an activity, as it gives error after error. I am running it on a Pixel 5, fully updated, so it is not my phone's issue.  My only guess is that Google might be about to discontinue this app soon or something, because based on the comments here, I am not the only one having issues. It is a shame, it was so nice before!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Frustrating. it doesn't import any of my Strava results even though it's set to synchronize. and it doesn't let me make any changes or even delete the ones that get logged in my ""journal"" - i can see a ""more options"" button but it disappears when i try to click it. I'm amazed that Google would release an app with so many bugs !",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Tracked perfectly for a few days, then lost an entire afternoon walk, 6k+ steps, the day after it was tracked. The activity is there when you look at calories, and the total miles are correct, so it must be a bug in the app. Make it more reliable, and easier to fix if this happens again! I would very much appreciate a fix that retrieves or recalculates my steps in the next few days while the step challenge is on, rather than just improving it down the road.",2.0
Brenda Thompkins (Butterflydzines),Functional,"I ended up uninstalling - this stupid app is downright user UNfriendly. I'd like to just keep track of steps but those I've taken recorded automatically from the phone's movement ADDS to the amount of steps I manually record and it ends up being wildly inaccurate and I don't see a way to correct or change it. I'd like to not be forced to enter time spent or duration when it's an all day total, not an actual workout. I'll find an easier and more accurate way to record my progress.",2.0
Eric Vandewater,Functional,"Lags compared to other apps. I like that it's ""always on"", but some deficiencies. The weeks are screwed up, it consistently displays distance on the previous week. I wish I could see my total mileage for a month versus having to sum up the individual days. It's still installed on my phone but I'm tracking more accurately with other apps.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Doesn't track accurately and then doesn't allow you you to edit anything to improve it's accuracy.  Response to comment below. ""I've tried that multiple times as instructed by the help section. However when I follow those steps the only sections it lets you edit are the activity title and notes section. It shows no selection box for changing distance, time, etc...""",2.0
Rebecca Onuschak,Functional,"I'm only using it as a conduit between two tracking apps that don't take to each other. Worked fine until recently. Then it started changing the received weight from my scale by .1 lb. Not a big deal but annoying. An update fixed that, but now it changes what it sends to the other app. Sending and receiving a number without changing it is pretty basic programming.",2.0
Garrick Taylor,Functional,"Does not correctly sync with Strava. Of my last 10 Strava workouts, over half are missing. Randomly imported activity today but with the wrong date. I did ALL of the suggested ""fixes"" by the developer and it still doesn't work a lot of the time. Bottom line is this app needs significant improvement instead of expecting users to go through an arduous process every time they want to sync data.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Up untill yesterday I would have rated this app 4 stars. But yesterday it went wonky. It doesn't seem to be able to track my location anymore. I checked the location tracking settings and they have not changed. Still, today, it said I only biked 1.2 miles when I actually did 12. Update. I'm done with this app. It still won't track after I've done all the suggested fixes.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Really like the app when it works. It has the core features I care about. Unfortunately, it's broken quite often, especially after updates on my Huawei Smart Watch 2. I don't want to micro-manage my fitness apps - they just need to work and continue working with no fuss. Google is too busy adding features and breaking things to care about testing properly it seems. The latest problem after an update last week: it won't track steps properly at all. Huawei's tracking app works perfectly as always. Tired of having to spend time on getting this app to work.",2.0
Andrew Hash,Functional,"It's great when it works which is maybe 50% of the time. I have a Google Wear OS watch and a Google 6 Pro but Google fit stops working almost daily now. I've tried all the fixes, logging in and out, restarting devices, toggling the activity tracker on and off, none of it works. It's obvious there's a bug with Google fit that they're unable to fix. I've moved on to utilizing other activity trackers and highly recommend others do as well.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Used to like this app a lot but changes to the design have negatively impacted the UX. What is this giant visual in the middle of my screen and what is its purpose? I don't care about some Google specific point system, I want an app that makes tracking, and compiling fitness data, easier. Preferably using metrics that can be referenced when speaking to a doctor, personal trainer, or coach. Texhnically, I'm fine with the extra point system as an added motivation but it shouldn't be such an invasive part of the app. Not only is the data hard to find, it seems less accurate. Can I just have old version? Also why doesnt this version sync with my Aware app anymore?",2.0
Jay Tee,Functional,"I find this app to be temperamental at best. I mean it changes my weight to something it has never been; the tracking of the steps seems a little off. It takes all day to sync with my other apps and it almost has no real purpose for having other than tracking it with the American Heart Association to tell me I'm doing good or bad for the week. I was going to give it 3 stars, but the weight thing is really got me upset.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"App mostly works (can be glitchy when you add activities manually) but you can't set/track normal goal metrics like distance or elevation. Stop trying to make ""heart points"" and ""move minutes"" a thing. Maybe they are a better measures of effective exercise, but are hard to plan around and motivate around. This app is complicating my life instead of simplifying.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I used to really like this app! Easy to use and clearly tracked data. This update it terrible though. Every time I add something, there is no update to my overall goal for that activity for the week. I don't get it. I hope the next update isn't as terrible, or I'm back to finding something that's actually useful. And, I don't care about ""heart points"". Just let me track my workouts for the week!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"this app got a lot worse after the update a while back. used to be very good fitness app for tracking lots of activities. it is frustrating that you can't edit the time of an activity anymore which is important if your phone dies mid activity. now if your phone dies, the activity keeps going and you cannot stop it. also you can't view and move the map of your activity unlike before the update. I don't really care about the heartpoints feature that was added either. just give me the old app back.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Inconsistent. Heart points sound great but how they work is odd, especially syncing across apps. Did 11 mi. bike ride today in MapMyRun. Initially Google Fit showed double digit points. When my Fossil watch synced to phone, suddenly i only had 2. Now, 6 hours later it dropped to 1. Pretty sure negative points wouldn't make sense. Just inconsistent and therefore, unreliable.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I want to like this app as it works in unison with other apps I currently use, but after weeks of use, it's as much a let down as that relative who eats at Taco Bell when south of the border. You wonder why you even bother bringing them along.  The major disappointing sigh is in it's visual appeal... or lack thereof. Bundle up as this app is so stripped down that I found myself double checking the Play store to ensure I hadn't actually installed some 5th grader's unfinished summer camp app project. I easily waste 10 minutes every time I open the app, as I confidently morph into Sherlock, absolutely sure this will be the time I uncover some hidden area or setting that I have just somehow managed to overlook... over and over and over again. Other than the picture of myself, the only two colors are shades of blues and blacks, both psychologically induce the opposite brain reaction one needs to feel invigorated, energized, or motivated to get up and get moving. There's a reason doctor offices and Hospitals aren't painted red and fast food places are.   It is probably for the best I've run out of characters as, unlike the app, my review gets more colorful.",2.0
Mahammad Sabir Ali,Functional,"It does not work in the background. Yesterday I collected around 50 heart point, it gave a bonus of 150 heart point out of nowhere. If I have to open the app and start pace walking every time, then I am out. I don't need this.",2.0

I would also like a full list of supported voice commands and haven't been able to find one. 2) I don't need to track my weight, so it would be nice to be able to turn that off and not have the big weight meter taking up space in the middle of the app's front page. 3) It's pretty clunky and slow to start tracking any kind of workout that's not a run.

This app consistently counts only 60-75% of my steps vs. another app which counts 98-100%.  I have searched and can find no way to adjust the accuracy so that's it.  I think I do like the idea of the Move Points and I like the workout (walk) tracking with the map and all, (although the map sometimes does not show my whole round trip), and I like being able to track other items (bp, weight, etc), but that's not enough for me to stay with this app.  Also the app will not let me enter heart rate; that part only works with a separate tracker device.  I'm giving 3 stars to give the app the benefit of the doubt, but I am removing the app from my phone.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I had the app before the recent update with Google's new branding style and enjoyed it a lot then. I normally strength train and go running so it's a good app to compile all of my exercises in one place and you could go in and edit the details the app got wrong about your workout. Now that it's been updated, I can't go in to fix the milage or time of a run I tracked with the Nike Run app (you can connect apps to it to input other workouts automatically). Being able to connect related apps is a great feature because I can see all my workouts in one place still without having to manually do it all the time, but it doesn't get the details right. For example, if I go for a 1.5 mile run through my Nike Run app, it'll show up on Google as a 1.3 miles and the time/pace will be wrong because of it but with the way the Google app is now, you can't edit that information. Also, when I delete the workout, and try to add the activity to put in the correct details, the heart points/move minutes don't adjust and I hate that I can't put in the ""seconds"" as the smallest time measurement because improving and tracking my times are super important. Overall, this app would be fantastic, if it worked a little more like the previous version.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Honestly, this updated app is rudimentary and has next to 0 customizability. The only thing it's decent for is giving a high level overview of activity. The only good thing about it is it's integration with other apps, which you will need in order to get ""credit"" for your actual exercise. You can't even add a personal goal, like ""workout 3 times a week"". Overall, very disappointing.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"3.5. I really like the concept of this app. However, after installing it I've found it pretty buggy - definitely not Google's usual standard. I tried adding a bike workout for 30 min, but when I checked it the duration was for an hour so I had to fix it. I then tried to add my strength training as an activity, but it didn't even show up after I saved it. It also doesn't allow manual heart rate entry, and every activity only shows steps and distance for me - not ideal for recording lifts.",3.0
Joanne Locnikar,Functional,"When I first use it, everything tracks fine. After about 2 months, it doesn't map my walks correctly and doesn't keep track of pacing. I have tried to start fresh with this app 3 times over the last 18 months. Same thing happens each time I install it anew. Very frustrating. I love that there are no ads so I've tried this app a few times. Unfortunately same thing happens each time.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I LOVE using this app and have recommended it to countless people, however there has been a few occasions where the app doesn't track things properly. For example, after working out this morning and inputting the values, I check my phone a bit later and the values skyrocketed to over 100 move minutes and more than double that in heart points, and continued to add more and more all day at times when I wasn't doing anything. Also has done the opposite after working out, where the values dropped.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I use this, but can't highly recommend.  First, the phone app often shows only the half the activity shown on my watch. Tried an uninstall, but that did not work. Today I tried unpairing, then re-pairing in hopes that this will take care of the problem. Secondly, the Fit watch face used to show the amount of steps right on the basic dial.  No longer.  No I have to click through twice to see the full amount of steps. It would be nice to see the steps on the basic face, then, if I want to see more info, click through to it.",3.0
Cyan YT,Functional,"It's not very informative at getting people into an active lifestyle, but is VERY good at being a ""Fitness tracker"" app. It seems to accurately count my steps when compared to a pedometer, can track heart rate and respiratory rate in-app as well. Takes a bit to figure out what various connectivity functions do. I just dropped it to 3 stars. No way to delete a specific entry, can only delete all data for a fitness category, or ALL data completely; any inaccurate reading cannot be overridden.",3.0
Shellie R,Functional,"I like the look of the app and how it displays information. I like the journal aspect to see my walks each day. But the tracking is always way off. The steps are accurate (match my pedometer app), but the distance and minutes seem random most days. I've sent feedback through the app sooooo many times. It gets old sending feedback over and over for the same issue. Easier to just manually change it. This app can be used in conjunction with a more accurate app but isn't very useful alone.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app itself works pretty well. Pretty easy to add activities and weight. I like the widget for tracking how I'm doing. One major complaint: it's too hard to get a useful overview of my data. Mobile isn't the best form factor for that, so I would like to view it on my desktop. But for some inexplicable reason, Google shut down their Fit website. Please offer a way to see my data on my computer!",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"app is not accurate to the tic watch fit app. the fit app on the watch will show 1500 steps during a walk while the app on the phone will say 0 or 100. this number can change during the say but will never be the correct amount. this is not limited to steps. it can be the distance, or calories burned as well. this is very frustrating and would love it to be corrected. oh and if you just log the activity to the phone application instead, the problem will still continue to happen.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Is it the greatest fitness tracking app? Answer, NO. But it's much better than the car wreck of an update Planet Fitness pushed out this past August, just look at their reviews, it's undeniable. At least I can track miles, minutes, and calories burned on this app. It could use improvements in the way it presents the data you enter by using bar graphs like Planet Fitness used to have on there app and solve the problems with interfacing with hardware and other apps as some complain about.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Overall, I like the motivation the app provides. When I check my progress while on a walk I can see whether I'm on track to meet my goal. However, lately I've noticed my mileage and steps walked don't coincide. For example, today the app registered 9.8 miles but only approximately 11,000 steps. That would be just over 5 miles. I'm more inclined to believe the step count. The GPS function needs attention. Thanks!",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I  have used Google fit for two weeks now.  It leaves much to be desired.  Today I used it on a bike ride of 21 miles, for which it registered only 11.6 miles.  Another problem lies in the mapping of walks and rides.  If I sit for  just a few minutes, it seems to confuse the app, and it  drops part of the walk or ride either the first half or the second.  The mapping function also seems to easily drop a major part of the walk/ride.  I think the app needs more work.  Bryce Johnson",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Was working great, no idea what happened. When my screen on my Galaxy S9 goes off, my gps location no longer tracks and just shows a ""as the crows fly"" track. Tested this out around a square park today. Isn't the point of using these apps to set it and forget it, but still know things are working? Also running into an issue when I'm done with the workout and still shows a notification that it's still currently tracking, even though it's not. Only way to get rid of the notification is to restart",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I admit I only downloaded this app for use with Pokemon go as it will not connect to the fitness tracker I currently prefer but first impressions are not so great. It's not intuitive really in the least. I had to dig for the settings menu, it set goals for me automatically that probably will be perfectly useless for me. I love Walking but I'm not going to go just because some app tells me too. Sorry. Also it snows 9 months out of the year where I am so I can't possibly walk every day because it simply isn't safe sometimes to walk in blizzards and 4 + feet of snow. I will give this app one month after I can connect it with go. If my impressions haven't improved by then and/or I find it useless in some way it's going bye bye again. Just so you know I love walking and use a simple app called pedometer pretty regularly. It's a wonderful app that tracks steps taken, distance walked, and calories burned among other things pretty accurately. It isn't very robust but it does exactly what I want and need it to and it does it well. Only downside is I have to turn it on and leave it active for about 5 mins for it to be accurate but it's easy on my phone for battery and processor so with Pokemon go it's amazing even if I can't sync the two. Sorry.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really like the concept of move minutes and heart points, and how they automatically adjust based on your recent activity.  However, this concept does not work when move minutes and heart points aren't counted from aggregated activities from 3rd party apps.  Strava, for example, will create activities in the Journal, but you'll get zero points for it unless you manually override the activity with a new activity of your own.  I have heard that My Fitness Pal syncing is the same way.  I also cannot sync directly from a Suunto watch, so the amount of manual syncing that's required to make this useful is painful.  Also, the New Year Challenge is confusingly simple - there are milestones, but it's unclear what the actual goal is here or how you're doing in general.",3.0

Kevin,Functional,"3 stars â€¢ Impractical | The design of this app is great. It's nice and clean and has a dark mode!

There is no ability to track calaries in, which could really help. I recommend looking for a different app.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love that this app tracks ""move minutes"" and "" heart points"" to help you track activity levels, not just number of steps. I hate that it is incredibly inaccurate. It constantly drops steps; you open the app, it shows a step count, then updates and lowers that count - by hundreds of steps, sometimes over a thousand. I have a smartwatch, and the numbers on the watch's fit app never seem to match the app on my phone; and when they do sync, the app defaults to the lower number of steps (apparently). I've watched my step count drop on phone and watch over and over. It does not sync well with other fitness apps; they overwrite the Google fit data. If I track a bike ride on fit, and another app also picks up the activity, but doesn't track correctly (because I didn't set that app to track), the Google fit data is overwritten by the other app - which only picks up about a third of my ride. It they could fix these issues, it would be the best fitness app I've used, but at this point it's so unreliable that I need redundant apps in order to get anything close to accurate info.",3.0
Paris,Functional,"Since the most recent update, the number of steps and heart points show up as zero.

A Google user,Functional,It's ok. Could be better. Should allow you to share and compete with friends and family. UI can also be more intuitive.

Gandelf,Functional,"It has some nice features. At least, they would be nice if the program would work. It only records workouts, steps, and heart points if it feels like it. Even when it does feel like it, it's extremely slow to pick up data from my primary device/app combo. It randomly forgets workouts that it has previously credited. (Yesterday, it went back and forth between crediting my afternoon walk or my evening workout--but never both.) The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 is that it is not my primary tracker so when it fails it's no more than irritating. I simply set what it calls goals and I call minimums to something low enough that I can still keep my streak even if it drops half what I do. When it doesn't randomly drop things, it counts steps pretty close to the same as my primary app, and I have the feeling that it counts calories used rather more accurately. The only thing I'd like to see different (other than working properly) is counting heart points on a rolling week instead of Monday to Sunday and then you start over.",3.0

With the new update as of 11/21 it's not possible to see all 4 at a glance any longer. You have to swipe between screens or tap multiple times to get all 4. Not convenient at all when wearing gloves or in locked mode. I still like the heart rate monitor, but the app no longer provides what I need. I rounded the rating up. I think it's really about a 2.5 start app with the latest modifications. I would have put it between 4 and 5 before.",3.0

For added exercises I would recommend adding the typical amount of heart points and move minutes because in most cases that is impossible to know.",3.0
Tsalagi Yi,Functional,"If you dont have cell service, as in out of the country there are better apps for your exercise routines. This one shows all the roads on the map, but the exercise doesn't follow the roads or your route. Also, it tracks when not prompted resulting in many so called walks which are aggravating to delete. To delete them you have to delete them one at a time taking WAY too much time than you want to spend on something that should be simple.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really liked this app because it measured my overall activity, it tracks my time and gave active minute goals. I liked it a lot, especially during the shelter in, because I'm not walking far but I'm staying active. The update changed it to just another step counter. I hope the producers will consider allowing the app the track both and let the user choose which goal system is most useful themselves.",3.0
Dan Chan,Functional,"Fit is good at figuring out what activity is occurring automatically (walking, running, cycling). However, Fit undercounts the distances. The problem is Fit doesn't sample GPS data often enough, as evidenced by the Fit maps. Google Maps correctly shows the true path and distances traveled, so it's not phone or signal problem.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"It was doing great until recently. starting March 16th, it hasn't been doing well with mileage when matching the steps. I would have done 2 miles worth of steps, for example, and although the step count is right, the mileage will say I've only done like 0.35 or something way less. So because of that, it's messing up with mileage for synced apps such as Lympo and Pokemon Go, and hurting the progress in those apps. Been trying to contact but haven't been able to, so leaving concern here.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app is reasonably good at differentiating between walking and bike riding. I'm not sure how accurate the step count is. Significant difference between this and Samsung's fitness tracker. As much as 20% more than Samsung. Small bug when I actually start a workout activity (bike ride) When I end the ride, the notification of an active ride is persistent and will not close. I have to force close the app. No data is lost, so just a minor pita.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,This app initially works great but then after a month or less it will stop accurately counting my steps. I work 10 hour days on my feet (very physically active job) with only 20 minutes where I'm sitting in one place for lunch. When the counter works correctly it says I'm at about 14000 steps. But it must have an algorithm for steps recorded if it thinks you're getting too many because it suddenly drops to maybe 4000 steps per day until I reinstall it. Frustrating!,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"App used to work great but just like everyone else it stopped working recently. The app will not count any of my steps or activities. It also no longer will allow me to sign in on my regular account and I had to log in with a different account. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and that did not work, switching accounts didn't either. I'm just trying to get an accurate pokemon go step count and without adventure sync it doesn't work, so I beg of you, please resolve this issue.",3.0
Karla Tberry,Functional,"Great when it works but it doesn't like changes. If I do aerobics one day & walk the next, it does not like the change. Even if I switch to the correct icon it continues to monitor the previous exercise. According to this app, I recently did aerobics for 26 hours. One day I walked 59 miles! Yeah right. I don't think so. I uninstalled the app & reinstalled it. Hope that works.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I would have given this app 5 stars, but Google made a change and now it's 3 stars. Home shows you steps, calories, distance, heart points, and move minutes for the current day. Journal displays steps, heart points, and workouts. It no longer shows total move minutes for prior days. I was using this app to track total minutes moved per day, so now I have to use a different app. Journal does not display calories burned. Otherwise it works well. Easy to log workouts. Easy to synch w other apps.",3.0
Tim Lehner,Functional,"It's OK. Does what it needs to do, mostly. One big problem is that part of my running route has poor GPS connection, so my daily 'loop' is always wrong, showing an interpolated path cutting through yards and homes, mis-estimating the distance. It needs is a 'snap-to-predefined-path', and/or a 'snap-to-roads', and/or 'edit path taken' options, so when GPS is lost, it assumes you followed the road or a predetermined path, rather than running through people's houses and yards. When the distance is manually corrected, it should auto-correct related quantities: steps, min/mile, calories expended.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's ok! But something I'd like to suggest is to put a sleep tracker in the app. Sleep is very important to your overall health. This app is very basic considering it's a Google app. I also would like for the fitness tracker to take the phone it's connected to to be able to also track steps/mileage using GPS. The fitbit app is amazing and I wish this was more like that, i.e. sleep tracker, ability to add friends for accountability, challenges amongst users, earn badges, etc.",3.0
Adrian Cortes,Functional,"Used to be great now mediocre, I liked the ability to track move activity instead of steps. They should added the steps feature as an optional feature instead of replacing it as the main mode of tracking. Now the app doesn't track cycling very well which, is my main form of exercise, I done a 10mile ride and had Strava track everything correctly however when viewing on Google Fit it only tracked 4miles of it . An update with an option to choose the previous method would be great.",3.0
Chris Doehring,Functional,"I think the app has great intentions and with some trackers may integrate really well. I received my Mi Band 4 about 3 weeks ago and Google Fit sync'd with it not flawlessly but it was good. Fast forward, some steps aren't counted, to the tune of 300-400 a day. Syncing is sporadic and is rarely current when I check in on it. That said this is my first tracker since I trashed my fitbit. I had a model several years ago that you couldn't replace the band and it cost roughly 140ish. Swore I'd never go back to a company that did that. My Mi Band 4 is awesome. I've not seen ghost steps, does all the usual things, like that I can check weather immediately, locate my phone (If I don't have floors and walls interferrring too much), heartbeat etc. And at a fraction of what that fitbit cost. And it's global enough that I'd think Google Fit would better sync with it. I expect that Google Fit will catch up but that's not a sentiment I attribute to google.",3.0
Matt Clark,Functional,This app falls far short of the mark for anyone serious about exercise. There are many apps that track location very well and provide accurate distance and other stats using only GPS data. This app is not one of them. Distance and other data are so inaccurate it's absurd. Data such as elevation gain is missing. It feels like they coded this halfway and then just gave up. This app has so much potential yet it was all hurriedly tossed overboard. A significant disappointment from Google.,3.0
Amber Joy,Functional,"While I like the steps/HR data, and the walk mapping is really nice, the ""heart points"" are a frustrating mess! (Yes I used the in-app Developer contact.) They disappear for no reason, making it a useless metric. Sometimes they come back, but they don't stay. For example, mine went up to 15 or 16 yesterday, dropped down to 3 at the end of the night, went back up to 15 an hour or two later, now the next morning they dropped to 2 for that day! Steps and heart rate data for that day are unchanged.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Overall my experience with the app has been a good one.  However, the app syncing feature is not working and it is extremely frustrating. I have the Under Armor Record app connected to my google fit app, but the two apps do not sync at all.  The connected app is listed on the google fit site as a compatible app.  After trying to troubleshoot the issue my Under Armor Record app is now no longer showing as being a connected with google fit anymore. I have read all the help articles in the google fit help center and nothing is solving the issue. And there is no one I can contact to discuss the problem.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's good that you track 5 thing's in the main page but how about giving the user the ability to decide which 2 should be their primary goals. Also, could their be an option whether the app uses my name. I mean I know tracking me is the price of admission and some people might actually like it but I find it a bit creepy. Other than that decent app does what I need, thanks.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's okay. I remember it having more functionality back when I had a moto360 years ago. Why isn't there an enormous heart rate button I can press while I'm working out? Instead I have to scroll and squint to find the tiny button. Also I can't edit the length of my workout. I forget to end my workout, and it keeps recording my driving. This is a basic setting that needs to change. **update, the dev gave me directs on how to edit workout type not length. there is no way to edit length. runaround",3.0

Journal now refreshing. Still no sleep,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Looks like it's pretty much just a step tracker. No obvious indication that it's capable of linking to my smartwatch, no clear method of importing exercise information from other apps, and it doesn't look like there is any ability to go on an actual computer to mess around with the data. Probably most useful for people who want to let Google track their every step and count it towards their exercise goals. My own preference is to not count such activities and only count my exclusive exercise activities towards my goals, so the app doesn't seem to be useful for me.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Edit and Delete functions are not available for activities. Errors cannot be rectified. Directions for corrections are incomplete or the option to select ""more"" or ""advanced"" options is not linked properly because it doesn't exist.

Alejandro Guillen,Functional,"It is okay for passive tracking but has several technical issues that prevent it from being a good fitness app. Main complants: Cannot create work out routines in the app, does not communicate well with other fitness apps, no option to delete a single erroneous entry (weight), & GPS tracking for walk/run very unreliable. Also, after looking over recent replies from the developer the answer seems to always be: use these troubleshooting articles because we are not going to look into anything.",3.0
Timothy Chace,Functional,"If you have other devices, a smart watch, a smart scale, use MyFitnessPal, then this is a good place to keep data in one place and act as a conduit to connect multiple app data. The tracking of exercise is wildly different from my watch. It also doesn't take into account heart rate when calculating calories, just time and some arbitrary burn number. If the app added intermittent fasting tracking it would be more useful as well. Maybe add that.",3.0
Alexandra Palacios-Rodriguez,Functional,I am a bit disappointed now with the app. Today was the biggest disappointment. I really wanted to only use this app to track my workouts because it syncs with my watch. Today We did the same trail we did yesterday it was a 7 mile loop. Today half way there it said I had already done 8 miles and looking at the map there were long blue lines in areas I did not hike. My friend then started to keep track on her iPhone. I mean I guess you cant get mad at an app that's free right.,3.0
Nathan Levine,Functional,"Mehhh, could be more user friendly. if you made the app a little bit more friendly like the Samsung fit app I think you would have a much better quality app you can't really make any adjustments you accidentally put the wrong data in there for like blood pressure it's stuck can't make changes to it and then you can't just use your phone to automatically check your blood pressure using that app as well That's one thing and then the walks you can't just start a walk and stop a walk.",3.0
Alex Reynolds,Functional,"Pretty good and getting better. Still a little ways to go to catch up with Fitbit. Wish it would show an easy to read graph of the history of my resting heart rate. It tracks it, but you can only look at it a day at a time. Also wish I could sync activities tracked with Google Fit to other services like Runkeeper or Strava or Fitbit.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"HR, calorie, and step tracking (Using WearOS) is great. As is the integration with other services (Strava, etc)  However, I see TONS of activities that I didn't do. Numerous ""Afternoon Hike"" entries that have a duration of under 1 minute. This essentially makes the ""Journal"" section useless.  I wish there was a way to turn off what seems to be automatic activity tracking. If I want to track an activity, I'd rather explicitly start it.",3.0
Dawn Ellis,Functional,"This app is ok. Unfortunately, I'm never sure of the accuracy of my walks. It doesn't seem to be consistent with distance in relation to the activity and map. The map will show my walk ending about halfway through. Sometimes the distance will reflect that ending point on the map and other times it will be correct, regardless of what the map says.",3.0
Francisco Fadul,Functional,Easy to enter manual activities. Nice journal feature to keep track of daily activities by date. Some suggestions: Too much white space that could be replaced with useful info. Strava activities automatically populate only 50% of the time for me and there's no easy button to manually trigger the update. Calendar could be better and easier to navigate. Trending graphs should be added as they are useful.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,Update 03/07: Suddenly seems way too generous on heart points or is it just me? Was working well for some time before now. Previous review: The performance of Google fit is at times at times a challenge. Can count heart points too high or too low at times or just erases a whole bunch randomly. I lost a week's worth of tracking in August 2021. The app is fantastic at times and frustrating at other times. I've stayed with it solely for the heart points feature.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,the app is very complete. Gives me the ability to track much more than I actually need.What surprises me is it doesn't have an option (that I can find) to upload the results to an outside app. ie Humana's go365 app. Many of the insurance companies are encouraging this by offering discounts on premiums for hitting certain goals. I didn't like the Fitbit because of it's limited smart watch capabilities. I thought Google would be in the forefront of this rather than lagging behind.,3.0
J.D. (ACE7F22),Functional,"I love the idea, but it seems glitchy, and missing a lot of features that I feel should be built in, and not rely on third party apps. Things such as passive heart rate checking, more accurate activity and location tracking, logging other vitals that are available through connected devices like wearables. There could also be a notification to edit, or add info to recent workouts once the app detects you're resting, maybe ask how you're feeling, so it better understands you.",3.0
Pamela Okerholm,Functional,"Move minutes was replaced by steps in the mid-April 2020 update. I don't understand why that can't be a toggle. I don't count steps, I count activity minutes.

Instead they keep adding more and more modules.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I do the same exercise every morning so it would be nice if I could copy the previous day exercise easily but as far as I know this is not possible.

Besides this the measurements are very inconsistent. This last problem is probably watch fault though.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I like the split to Move Minutes and Heart Minutes in the 9.2018 update. That said, Google has work to do. Sometimes I get notifications of having achieved a goal, only to open the app and find out I have not. Some days I'll get this incorrect notification several times a day. To be fair, I don't use a watch, but I feel even the phone alone should be more accurate.",3.0
Michelle Dillon (MichellesTwoCents),Functional,It is a great app if you have Fitbit or a google smart watch. I have the Letscom watch. Though it says that it my VeryFitPro is connected it doesn't seem to load data accurately which disappointing. I don't want to get another watch just to use this app. So I guess I won't use it. So if you have Letscom device that uses the VeryFitPro I wouldn't recommend this app. Doesn't work well with that device. Hopefully they update or something.,3.0
Jason L,Functional,"Thought IÊ»d try this out. Seemed to track my first walk/run ok. But then I tried to add an earlier swim from the day to see my total calories and IT MERGED THE TWO ACTIVITIES. For a little while, you could see both activities separate in the Journal, ,but now its only 1 and you can see my route around the city park, but the activity is labeled ""morning swim"" >:( And with Googles ubiquity across so many devices, why cant their be a desktop version that it syncs with?",3.0
Camden Mac Leod,Functional,"This app is decent. The only reason I use Google Fit is because my smartwatch and workout apps sync to it so it's an easy HQ that allows me to see all my data at a glance - good job! Besides that, the app over-simplifies activity with things like ""heart points"" instead of active minutes. In my opinion is better for inactive couch potatoes than real athletes who want to see genuine data. It also doesn't include meal tracking and my walks and runs don't show a map ðŸ™",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Using the Wear OS version and Android version.   One bug report...  Expected behavior (maybe I'm wrong): a tracked workout stores calories, steps, heart rate, etc... in the record which is uploaded to the Fit cloud and remains fixed for historical purposes.   What's happening: a tracked workout on the Wear OS app gets uploaded or sync'd (not sure which happens first) to the Android app and the calorie data and steps are overridden by what appears to be the normal daily tracked data, starting at zero. In fact, when I view the workout history, I notice the calories for a historical workout record will continue to creep up throughout the day at what appears to be the pace of my metabolic rate.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Not sure what happened to this app because it used to be my favourite. Now, it doesn't track any of my workouts or yoga sessions and hasn't worked right in a good month. I'm trying reinstalling it to see if that'll change but I'm not hopeful. Update: the reinstall didn't work because now it won't even verify my account. I hope Google sends out a patch soon because this is frustrating",3.0
A Google user,Functional,Automatic tracking is not reliable. Sometimes it tracks me exercising but I'm just driving. Sometimes it doesn't pick up my exercising. It's just so frustrating. I wish they gave you a pop up question to see if you started exercising and then track the distance a little better. It does have other options to log your work outs and weight loss though. So the app isn't a complete bust.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I am having trouble with the app. If I do not take my phone with me and add a workout manually, it only shows the last input.

AM Cub,Functional,"The UI is what you would expect from Google. Very clean, minimal and white (thank you for dark mode). It seems accurate, but it focuses on ""move minutes"" and ""heart points"" instead of calories/steps. What is a move minute? I don't know. Google doesn't know. Nobody knows and nobody cares, but they are sticking with it for some reason. I assume it is so they have something proprietary that will separate them from the other trackers. I am separating back to FitBit. Add rucking to activities, pls.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Not bad. I only have it because it syncs with my game. It does not support the major brands of fitness watches, so 3 stars. It does allow you to add activities manually, but it's a pain to go back a day because you forgot. You won't see total steps for prior dsts. Just meaningless heart points. Google bought Fitbit. Hopefully, they replace this app with the much better Fitbit app and don't screw up Fitbit",3.0
Reginald Bailey,Functional,"It would be nice if the app could accept data from Fitbit, which is able to monitor efforts in non-GPS related activities like Spinning, etc., much better. Also the GPS related measurements for walks, bike rides, etc. along familiar routes yield wildly inaccurate results compared to the known distance for these routes. I am reluctant to trust its distance reporting and I was hoping there was a way for a user to edit the activity results, especially when you know it's wrong.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"like it, but it keeps automatically assuming I'm working out on a highly intense activity level, which isnt the case (I strive for moderate), throwing off my heart points and my calorie burn severely, but I cant edit an activity after the fact to decrease it. The only way I can prevent this is by manually entering a workout after the fact, which defeats the purpose of what I want the app to do.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Not the most consistent at tracking. The app stopped tracking my activity a few weeks ago and there was nothing in the settings I could find to fix this problem. after reinstalling the app, it instantly decided that I earned 83 move minutes for the day and 0 heart points. This was highly inaccurate because I hadn't even gotten out of bed yet. I recommend Samsung Health for Galaxy users because I've never had problems with it. However, Fit has consistently tracked my steps for PokÃ©mon GO.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app has some applications that are promising, but they are not that accurate. for example after a 2 mile run it says that you have covered the 2 miles in distance; however it may also say that you only did 5 heart minutes and 6 move minutes. Overall a great concept, just needs improved accuracy.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Motivates me to get out and get moving every day, and I like being able to set goals. My issue with the app is with the measurement of my pace while running. Looking at the chart after every run shows my pace significantly fluctuating over the course of the run. Like constantly. Makes the graph very unhelpful and pace measurement likely innacurate. The fluctuations often show changes of 1 minute or more in my mile pace over a very short distance when I haven't stopped or greatly changed my pace.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Really doesn't give much information about anything. I don't really care how many minutes I've moved as much as I want to know intensity, how long, if stairs were involved etc. Paired with the overestimation of distance people have mentioned doesn't help. I use it because it pairs with my meal tracking app, but according to that, Google fit overestimates calories burned as well.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really like this app as a general activity tracker and goal setter. But, this app falls short of it's competitors such as Samsung Health, with features such as food logging and widget support really lacking.

Roger Beattie,Functional,"Formerly it was better. It does an okay job tracking what you do. It is nearly impossible to find where to start an activity. Activities should be right in your face when the app starts not hidden 4 clicks away. The name activity is in the title of what the app is, isn't that ironic. Also there is no definition anywhere as to what a heart point is. That is ridiculous. Impossible to set goals. I am not a novice user. I am a Google fan. The app looks pretty but has little usability.",3.0
Michelle Hunter,Functional,EDIT: I did what they suggested. The program still doesn't add distance or calories for anything added manually. I don't like that it doesn't track anything you add manually like swimming. I swim for two hours and manually enter it. It adds the heart points but not the activity time or calories that I enter. I really wish they would fix this.,3.0

No hourly step reminders or ability to connect with other users. Does not stand up against other fitness apps,3.0
Abby Johansen,Functional,"Enjoying the app sometimes, but really don't like the update to show steps instead of move minutes for my goals.

A Google user,Functional,Great to track or aggregate health metrics most of the time. I have two issues though. First there is no native sleep tracking but Sleep as Android does a good job. Second if I have activity tracking on in the phone settings and have my watch track steps my step count always goes down when they sync. When I lose steps it is hundreds at a time which is stupid because I do walk around with out my phone on me then lose steps the watch counted off the watch.,3.0
Lourdes Pena,Functional,"The app is OK but I miss the earlier version when you could track the history of daily totals (not just activities) and be able to look at it in daily, weekly and monthly mode. If I don't keep a written or screen shot of my final daily total, it's gone after midnight. I think the app took a step back.",3.0
Mary Knuth,Functional,"NEED SWIMMING OPTIONS!! I really do like the app for a general idea of daily activity. I have it on my phone and fossil gen 6 smartwatch. I use it daily to track steps, walks, and hiked. I loved the stroller walking option. There is a ton of sort options, but no option to track a swim on my watch. The other swim apps are terrible. I have started tracking a swim as a walk, then changing the category to swim on my phone. I am really hoping that an update soon will fix this. PLEASE!!!!!!",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"It was great, until one day it just stopped working. I uninstalled and reinstalled it onto my phone but it would not work without a wireless connection. Something that is meant to track wall walking or running shouldn't need a wireless connection, in fact that's nearly impossible. Wish they could fix this little bug because I would love to reinstall the app again.",3.0
Menna Mourad,Functional,"I've been using this app regularly with my wear OS watch for a while now and, for the most part, it's great. But lately, it's been removing heart points after the fact. I tend to look back on my data, and happened to today and noticed a majority of my heart points for the past few weeks were missing after it had previously tracked them. Not sure how to resolve this issue or if there is even a resolution, but it seems like one that needs to be fixed.",3.0
Adriane Mozzini,Functional,"Update: I tried the recommended fix, counted 50 steps at a moderate pace, but the app reported only 3. At least it seems to track distance okay. Overall, it's a useful app although its counts are inconsistent. For example, today's walk was .21 miles longer in 1 min less time, but yesterday's walk recorded 6000+ steps and 40 heart points while today's recorded 3000+ and only 3 heart points. Both walks were on the same streets.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,Love this app so much as it has allowed me to be more conscious of keeping up with healthy habits. I don't care for the recent update to change move minutes to steps as the daily goal. Some activities I do don't generate many steps such as gardening and yoga. Also while working I don't have my phone on my person so I'm not calculating those steps to help reach my goal. It's discouraging not to see both goals completed. I'd prefer to have move minutes as a goal.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,I was a loyal google fit user for 5 years and I used everything the app does. After the change I wanted to give the move minutes and heart points a chance but they didn't work for me due to innacuracy and the fact that I care about step count more. Currently I moving on to another app but it would be perfect if you could have an option to choose steps OR move minutes as your goal.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The new version has definitely improved the usability with heart points etc instead of just the steps. But in doing so they removed lot of features which were there in original app. Second thing is the wearable, Google really needs good hardware to support all the features. Currently wearos is abysmal in fitness and health.",3.0
USS Barry,Functional,Fit no longer display steps and heart points on the main screen starting yesterday. The green and blue circle shown you have some steps and heart points accumulated but the number inside the circle always 0. The steps shown correctly if you go to steps screen. The issue went away once you start an exercise tracking and sync the data between my watch and phone. The problem comes back once new day started after midnight when all numbers reset to zero. Manually sync phone and watch does not work.,3.0
Shawn Gross,Functional,"Usually works OK for me, minus the occasional glitch. However, it is completely on the blink today. I am walking right now and no steps are being tracked. Followed all the setting instructions, but it still is not working. This has happened before, and it suddenly corrected after about 10 days. Unfortunately, my steps for those days were lost. Ain't nobody got time for this. Disappointed.",3.0
Beth Cramer,Functional,"So many issues since a recent upgrade. I have a fossil sport watch. It has the latest update as well as wear os and fit apps. Does not seem to be recording background heart rate, but will record heart rate from an activity that I indicate on the watch. Also I have to restart the watch everyday to get the activity tracker to reset. Only the green circle needs this, it looks like the step tracker will reset like normal. Heart rate problems only the last two days, activity tracker issues over weeks",3.0
Erica Pettit,Functional,"this app does decent with tracking data from my smart watch but sharing that information with other apps is much harder than with other fitness apps (I gave up and got a 3rd party sync app but this functionality should be built in) It also needs more customization in the data display options, for example I would like to turn off the ""trend line"" on the weight graph. I know it's not accurate since it does line up with my data and because it's darker and on top it obscures the actual data",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Works well but really doesn't compare to its competitors (fitbit) it should have more options for tracking such as water intake, calories, ect. As well as share options on your activities ex. share as picture or share to social media instead of taking screenshots. This app just doesnt have a lot of depth!",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I could've sworn that I left a review... Not cool if it was deleted without my involvement. I had an issue where the app wouldn't sync no matter what I tried, and the solution was to disable/enable the body sensors permission in Google Play Services. Not sure how that got buggered, but this is Google after all... It's an interesting app, but because of Google's rep for throwing away apps and services they're bored with, the Fitbit ecosystem might be better for that reason alone.",3.0
Mike Sims,Functional,"This app always seems to tank after it's been working well for a while. I have it synced up to a MyZone heart rate tracker and it was working fine for a while. However, Fit now seems to ignore my runs. It just completely ignores the activity. What's more, it seems to lump my heart rate from different exercises into one exercise. Pretty frustrating as I do boxing training and I like using this app to track progress but it seems useless now.",3.0
Joe Uno,Functional,"With a smartwatch it is great. When you forget it at home and use the phone to track activities the distance is way off! Seems like it tracks using linear points on the map vs using true GPS data. Feel like it has something to do with having automatic tracking checked off. Idk, but choosing to start an activity to track, should enable metrics data which was not logged while working out.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app was great before the update. Now they took out a ton of features, like being able to see your calories separated into active and inactive in the journal. The interface is ugly and less user friendly as well. There's no option to change the interface or any premium feature to get the old functions back",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really only care about my daily step count (which isn't too accurate..but that's okay). Would be nice to see how many steps you took every day (maybe include this in your daily history summary?). The app is obsessed with ""move minutes"" and ""heart points"" which I don't care about (and after reading other reviews, neither do most ppl). Overall subpar UX and unintuitive layout for tracking activity, but still some useful info.",3.0
Kathleen Patterson,Functional,"I have had this amp for a number of years and it usually tracked my steps. since it's been updated it does not track my steps unless I manually start. That feature is not will explained in the app description and I think that the developers have done us all a disservice by changing how the app worked. I'm not very happy about this as I'm not going to pull out my phone to push the start workout button every time I start moving. I walk a lot at my job, I liked the way the previous version worked.",3.0
Marian Shah,Functional,"Update....now it adds phantom heart points that aren't there. I wish I could get 17 points sitting at a desk all day, but sadly don't think that is accurate. Will send feedback thanks! Doesn't work well on my new Samsung S21 + 5G. It shows consistently 800-1200 steps fewer than my Pedometer app. On my old S10 there was a discrepancy but not that much. Tried reinstalling and re synching and yes permissions and location are on.",3.0
Jeff Klein,Functional,"Under counts the distance traveled by about 10%. Map of walk is inaccurate and distorted. Really expect more accuracy from Google. Google reached out to me with a simple fix and IT WORKED, YEAH! upping my review to 5 stars. Fix only worked for a week. Need to restart and change permissions every morning. what a hassle. Back to 3 stars.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's a great app but it isn't good for keeping track of fitness goals if you drive with you phone in the vehichal as I have had it track a 5 minute shopping trip as a jog, at 30 miles an hour. So yeah it just needs some fixes so it cam tell whether I'm throwing my phone on the bed from when I'm going fast paced ed resize and driving from a jog.",3.0
Anne Malautea,Functional,"This app is good, but I've just come across a glitch. I use it to stay active and more often since I'm getting older. I really like the heart points feature because it holds me accountable. However, on Tuesday of this week, it showed my correct heart points at the beginning of the day, then by mid afternoon they were gone. I sent feedback to the app and shortly after, it was fixed. Now this morning they're gone again! This shouldn't be happening. Fix the bug, Google. Ridiculous.",3.0
Alice Brinkmeier,Functional,"If you're not a health nut, then this will work for you. I use this app for very bare bones workout tracking & really can't complain. I don't wear any type of smart watch & I actually have the pedometer completely disabled on my phone. This is my 2nd year using it to track bike rides. I was happy that it still had all my rides from last year saved in the Journal section so I could use them to plan for this year. Occasionally all the workouts will disappear or the data will be off in the list view, but it has always reappeared or corrected itself without major intervention from me. The only thing I wish I could do is access this ap on my laptop the same way that you can so many other Google aps such as email, calendar, sheets, keep, etc.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Generally does what it says. However, there is a huge difference in the steps that it logs vs what has been recorded on my day in my Garmin tracker. I have deleted and re-downloaded both apps to make the connection happen. I have followed the help options located on Google Fit. I have watched YouTube tutorials and read online suggestions from other users. Nothing has worked to make this sync happen correctly. Frustrated, as Google Fit is the requested app for my heath challenge at work.",3.0
Monica,Functional,"at first using this in conjunction with my mi fit band 4 was awesome! And then I noticed that on days that I didn't walk for exercise and I tried to tag weightlifting as my exercise, the heart points and calories would disappear after a few hours. Trying to go back and find those statistics in my history is also a problem. I cannot find the recorded heart points and statistics or my weight lifting activities. Only the walking! Booo!",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I liked the Google Fit app before it had steps. I think move minutes is a lot more general and applies to all activities where as to steps is mainly just walking and running. Google, if you're reading this review, please try to make it optional to have steps instead of move minutes because I do understand some people like it better. But, I do not. It would be really great and more useful to me and people who don't walk a lot as an exercise to have the move minutes option instead.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"It was a 5 now a 3. It was working well for me just recording and presenting accurate and useful activity information until about a month or two ago when I was on vacation. The maps of my running and walking became much more inaccurate, running was recorded as walking, sometimes running was not recorded at all, and steps walking around the house or office were not always recording. For example, a morning walk to the end of the driveway to pick up the newspaper or to put out the recycling would not record. I thought that maybe the app was having trouble adjusting to vacation in LA when it was used to a routine in the NYC and the suburbs. The problem persisted when I came home. I am not using any other device such as a Fitbit to record my activity. I thought that my Pixel 2 was acting as my activity tracker to count steps, record move minutes, and to track my location, to estimate running distances. I have an activity tracker called Stridekick on my phone. I installed it when from when my workplace had a steps challenge. Maybe that app was feeding information to Fit and that connection has stopped working or is now creating a conflict. I thought that Fit gets its activity information directly from the phone's accelerometer and location tracking. Perhaps the phone itself is not recording activity correctly. I also use Digital Wellbeing, so perhaps there is a problem with the Fit's interaction with that Android feature. Problem solving information on the other two recent posts which is available within the app did not provide insights about solving these problems.",3.0
Michael,Functional,"I like the app but heart points don't always show and miles tracking has a bug. When I'm finished with tracking a bike ride it shows accurate miles but the next day they show incorrectly. Example: I rode 14.2 miles on Thursday, the next day the same ride shows 3.8 miles... It also doesn't seem to pull info from the Wyze band properly.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,Somedays this app is tracking my driving as walking and not tracking my morning walks at all... I'm glad it has the option of manually recording workouts but its really inconveinient to do that every time I walk around for a bit. Its supposed to be keeping track of the distance and time I have walked for the day. This has got to be fixed ðŸ˜’,3.0
Bria Sativa Aguayo,Functional,"Pretty solid and user friendly app. I like to be able to track BP and activity. They lost me at estimated calories burned a day (including at rest). It's totally bogus and not based on science. Everyone has a different metabolism, bone density, muscle/fat ratio, hydration, etc., etc. It's guaranteed inaccurate within hundreds of calories. Don't just make stuff up, man. That's irresponsible and contributes to disordered eating and eating disorders.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Three stars is generous. This app could be good, since it tracks important metrics such as blood pressure, weight and sleep as well as exercise. It can connect to my Tickr X for an accurate heart rate reading, which is good, but the problem is it's woefully inaccurate in tracking exercise. I just finished a 7.9 mile mtb ride only for Google Fit to tell me it was a 2.5 mile ride. This alone makes it barely worth using.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app has serious sync and tracking issues. It will track a 6km run as a 1km walk and only 60 steps recorded. This app in combination with Pokemon Go also has serious delay and lack of tracking. Overall this is a great concept, but seems to lack in actual usability at this time without a compatable wearable device. Maybe add a feature for Pokemon Go users who use this when the game is idle to track progress and hatch eggs. Even a generic set step count and actual km tracking would be appreciated if you can not create a new workout option for Pokemon Go. Seems that Google missed the mark and is getting more promotion because of Niantic and that makes Google look incompetent.",3.0
Patrick,Functional,"Doesn't sync well with the Mi Fit app/Mi Band 5. A whole day of activities including an indoor rowing workout never transferred from Mi Fit to Google Fit. Any indoor rowing workouts that ARE transferred are recorded as ""walk"" in Google Fit. After weeks of sending Feedback to Google Fit through the Support menu in the app, nothing has been fixed or acknowledged. The app works better on it's own. Don't try to use it with an activity tracker.",3.0
Wayne Foote,Functional,The app started out good when I first started using it. But lately it was inaccurate with my walks sometimes saying I walked 0.3 miles other times saying 3 miles. It would get it right occasionally at 1.5 miles. The other thing that was annoying was the heart point awarded sometimes I would get 27 points for the 30 minute 1.5 mile walk other times it would only give me two points for the same walk. I finally un installed it.,3.0
Alicia Lici,Functional,This menu could be better. Surprisingly Samsung Health is pretty good in comparison. I see now that you could connect to other apps if you have history tracked which is a good idea. But you have to enter food nutrition manually. Why isn't there a food database to search from? I added a start for the cycle tracker. That is a nice feature and I don't have to get another app for that.,3.0
Tommy Costales,Functional,"Good software start. Two-star reduction for not having the most common options. For example, It would be nice if it included an option to scan bar codes to auto-input the nutrition facts. and the ability to copy events from exercise and meals from day to day. Finally, to be able to input by Ounces, not just milliliters.",3.0
Just Elise,Functional,"Decent... Wish you could track more. At the least be able to put your own pulse in - bp monitors include pulse. Would also be nice if it would take info from apps like lose it and etc for food intake, exercise, etc, weight. It goes from fit to the apps, but not the other way round. Med list or a pill reminder would also be nice.",3.0
Vincent R (Flagada002),Functional,"Nike Training Club recommended I pair it to google fit account one day. I was delightrd to see that was a thing so I signed up. Sure enough it counted those 2 modules i had completed, but it never synced anything after that, no matter that I wiped cache memory etc, reinstalled both apps. Also it was supposedly synchable to my schwinn IC4 indoor bicycle, but no such option seems to exist in there. It is not compatible with my samsung galaxy watch 3 either... not sure they're to blame for that.",3.0
Janet Nevaux,Functional,"Got this app to track steps post total hip replacement. There is no place in settings for this info, just age, weight and height. I'm hitting all my post surgery goals like a rock star, but the app, thinking I'm the average person my age, is very negative. I don't need an app's opinion of me, I'm good. But it does do a decent job of counting my steps. Ease of use is also good.",3.0
Laurel Stevens,Functional,"No ads, and some basic functionality. However, it gives me up to four times as many heart points when the phone is in my pocket rather than in my hand while I walk. It records the same distance in the same amount of time, about the same number of steps, but the heart points vary wildly. I don't wear a smartwatch or Fitbit. Baffling.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"App is great when it updates. It takes forever for it to refresh, and crashes majority of the time when it's trying to update the journal after a workout was auto detected. I would give 5 stars if you can get the system to refresh more frequently, and doesn't timeout and crash",3.0
RabblerouserGT,Functional,"Just a few gripes: ironically Google doesn't save this data on the cloud, which means that if you switch to a different device, all that data seems to go away. I'd also like the data between Samsung Health and Google Fit to be syncable. There's some things that Fit does that Samsung Health doesn't and things that Samsung Health does that Fit doesn't. For instance, Fit doesn't interact with the pulse oximeter on my phone. Not buying a watch when I have a perfectly fine pulse oximeter here.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,The concepts is good. The execution is mediocre and unreliable. It doesn't measure steps and heart points accurately. I have two other trackers and the difference between this app and the other trackers is sometimes close to 50% less steps. The difference between the two other trackers is around 3 to 4%.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,I love this and it has been great in keeping me honest on how much I walk. It is on my android phone .  The past week or two I have had some issues with it tracking my walks. It is not every day and usually it pops up later. Today nothing after a good 80 minute walk. Any suggestions> I want this to keep working> I have updated the app. Help please.  I guess I am going to have to down rate this app. My app is still not tracking and seems no one can give me help. I have tried to reset it but just keeps bringing up the same stuff.  I am very disappointed as I really liked it to start.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,It's good when it works but frequently it fails to sync with my TicWatch or record activity from other apps like LFConnect or MapMyRide or VESync. When bad readings (like someone else using the scale) editing or deleting them doesnt have any effect. Only tracks blood pressure and weight not other biometrics. Edit to add - recently activity data becomes corrupted over time - distance and calories reduce to not match initial correct values or map.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,simple app that does good job of tracking fitness steps and GPS in background data while you carry phone in pocket. Downside to this app is wont use Samsung's built in heart rate sensor on phone. but I found a app in play store called heart rate plus that works with sensor and will transfer data to Google fit. I tend to smash smartwatches.. lol cant use them.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The design of the app and the tools that it provides would be really great except that it can't seem to accurately track steps, distance, or whether I'm walking or driving. I have to manually delete ""activities"" everyday because it thinks that I'm walking or running when I'm actually driving.",3.0
Cayenne Moody Medina,Functional,"It's Good, But Could Be Great I like the tracking, the integration, the interfaces, how it looks on my watch and phone.

A Google user,Functional,"Edit: Have to turn on ""body sensors"" in 'Google Play Services' permissions. This allowed the setup to complete. I am looking forward to using this app. Couldn't even get past the setup wizard. The app kicked my height and wieght info out. The ""next"" & ""skip"" buttons do not work so I'm stuck on the page about ""move minutes"". There are no options to progress to the settings where I might be able to find a fix. Googles help page has no relevant information. I was very excited to try this out.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Gives me a good idea of how many calories I go through and definitely helps me keep track of my exercise. One thing that annoys me, though, is that tracking my walks results in variable results even though I follow the same route to the extent that one day will be marked as 6.5 miles while the next is 9, even though it's the very same route. A tool to edit these anomalies would be a plus.",4.0
Isaac Lamb,Functional,"I use the app for basically two things: step counting and run tracking. It does both of those jobs quite well. I do this through my phone itself without using a smart watch, and I seldom have any issues. The GPS is fairly accurate, definitely more so than other running apps I've used. The user interface is clean and good looking. My one complaint is that it gives far too many heart points for simple activities like going for a slow walk, so I usually go back and manually adjust it.",4.0
Kyla Tripp,Functional,"Good for tracking speed throughout but difficult to navigate - hard to end workouts. I can add a workout and hit start then put directly in my pocket without closing out, when I get done with the workout I open the phone, the app is on but can't find the stop button I have to scroll down from the top of the phone find the app, click the button that takes me to the screen where I can then stop it but by then I have already lost 10-15 seconds, when you're training to get time down it's not ideal.",4.0
Lauren Seaton,Functional,"I like this app, as it can sync with most of the other fitness apps I use. However, the past two days my steps and points are not shown in the main screen. If I go into the day itself I can see them, but it still shows 0 active minutes. None of the trouble shooting helps. It IS tracking, just not completely. Please fix",4.0
Jessica B.,Functional,"As a basic pedometer, its okay. It syncs to other apps like walking games and my intermittent fasting app to keep track. My only really problem is that when I wake up in the morning, it has already counted steps. Unless I'm some sort of secret sleep walker, that shouldn't be happening. I'm more puzzled than annoyed, but I would much prefer a clean slate in the morning!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Pretty good! Used to be perfect, but I recently started having an issue where the location is more inaccurate than usual when I go on a walk. It seems like it only tracks my location every 10 minutes or something, so the map has some wonky data points. That's my only issue though, and it used to not have this problem.",4.0
Joshua S,Functional,"Been using it for a few months now and the only complaint is that under ""Your daily goals"", I want to see the circle graph when I tap on a day, but instead it takes me to the bar chart, which is not immediately useful. It could be displayed separately, but I just want consistency. The path I walk is not accurate on the maps, but as long as the steps are (I believe they are), that's okay. It keeps me motivated to walk more, even though I don't always have my phone on me. That's okay too.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This is a perfectly serviceable, basic app to track distances traveled, maps of walks, runs, and rides, number steps, and other high-level information about workouts and day-to-day activities. I use it often on bike rides, walks, and runs. But when I compare it against the data that I can get from my Polar GPS running watch and its app it seems surprisingly bare bones. When I first started using it, I thought it would replace my other fitness tracker, but it's not nearly as comprehensive as I would have expected. It does what it does well, but it doesn't do as much as I would have thought.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I like the app as far as the info it records, but it would be my go to app for activity if you would add a sharing option when an activity is completed and even better a voice function that calls out your info every 5 minutes or so while walking/running.

Rich Conrad,Functional,"I would give app a 5 if not for recent frustration. The front screen started showing 0 steps and 0 heart points even though tapping into both show correctly. If I walk 5 miles, the miles show on front page, but shows I did it in 0 steps and 0 minutes. Very frustrating. I tried deleting app and re-adding. I love this app, so I don't want to switch to another, but I won't put up with this for more than a few days.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app is simple to look at and tracks walking pretty well. It encourages you and lets you know when you are succeeding.

You can see specific activities and point totals, but not time, distance or step totals (you can add the distances up yourself if you want).",4.0
Jessica Cushway,Functional,"The app does not load adequately. I'm always waiting for the info to be available. Cycle tracking is never accessible when I need it. The journal is also months behind and says it can't refresh. Okay, third at it on my review. You guys have obviously been doing some work because things are running much smoother and the app is linking the right way with other third party apps. Thank you!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Does everything i expect although my only recommendation is that using the app on more then one device that it reflects the same info live. There really isnt any real time numbers between devices. Sometimes it doesnt catch up all day and forced manually to sync. Again, its not a major concern, more of a description of my experience.",4.0
Russ H,Functional,"Love Google Fit. This would be my preferred app for all things fitness except for one thing: my brand new Fitbit won't sync natively with this app. That's the main reason I bought a FB after hearing about the Google acquisition. It's confusing to me why this feature isn't baked in already. You can grant access to a third-party app to sync data, but thats the only solution I'm aware of at the time of this review. Otherwise, I'm really pleased with Google Fit. Accurate, intuitive, and features!",4.0
Chris Kistler (Ziki),Functional,Using this app has definitely given me an incentive to exercise! I like the diversity of trackable activities and how you can adjust your goals as you go. One very minor problem is that Google Maps will sometimes track you in places where you weren't exercising. Not sure if it's due to a lack of signal or not.,4.0
Manda Braman,Functional,"I've been using Google Fit for yrs. I still don't know if I like the recent change that took away move mintues from main goals but I'm giving it a try. I do notice sometimes it thinks I'm riding a bike when I'm not. Also it would be nice to have more of a selection for activities, not just high intensity options. Also we can manually input BP but not pulse. Love that it has so much capability and potential & it's free. Thank you.",4.0
Alejandra Cubillos,Functional,"I really like this app, it's very encouraging. I would suggest adding a search bar when adding an activity. There are many options and it's annoying having to navigate to the bottom if the one you need is last in the alphabet. Also, the graph about weight progress is not helpful, it visually doesn't add any value because it isn't close to the real values.",4.0
Steve Walker,Functional,"I've been using this app since March 2019. After a couple of rough patches due to updates, I'm happy to say that Google Fit is now performing as expected. When used with my smartwatch, tracking my daily activities is easy and informative. The journal feature allows me to go back to the very beginning and see my progress. The updates sometimes tend to take a step backwards but, they are usually corrected within a couple days and the new features are welcome additions.",4.0
Steven Cornell,Functional,"I'm new to fitness tracking apps and I'm trying to get back into shape. The app together with my phone's camera, measures heart rate and respiratory rate more accurately and with a far better display of those results, compared to pulse oximeters I've used. However.

A Google user,Functional,"I use this app every day and I love the breadth of activity options it has. However there are a few bugs, the gps tracking for my walk to work and back likes to cut corners and this morning even says I walked in a straight line through houses, office buildings, and parking garages. I've also noticed it takes 3-4 failed attempts before ending or adding an activity, brings up an error message such as 'oops something went wrong' and 'cannot end workout.' Can end up taking 3 minutes to log workouts.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love the app, but do miss the ability to login on my computer and review my workout history. That was a huge useful feature that I used to stay on track with my long term goals.

Steve Breiner,Functional,"Thankfully, Google seems to have fixed the ""0 points"" bug, so I've upped my rating to 4... if its distance accuracy were better (I can take the same walk 3 times in a week, with different distances recorded for each), I'd bump it to 5.

Pomesa,Functional,"Whats included is decent but it also kind of feels like its not complete, for example under ""Browse"" theres lots of categories but not many of them do much. I think it would be cool if the categories were for fleshed out, for example allowing you to set water reminders right from the app instead of linking a water reminder app and porting in the information from the linked apps. Also it would be great if it included a mental health tracker as well, since all aspects of physical health are there",4.0
Arthur Upfield,Functional,"Good for a basic fitness app! Missing a lot of features I really want though, which I'm getting by using the Lose It! app for calorie counting. Automatically tracking runs and having a lot of support for fitness devices is a huge plus though. On the other hand, inputting workouts that Fit doesn't track by itself is a pain. Using Ring Fit Adventure or guesstimating jogs to put in time spent is a pain, although there are a lot of exercise options. Overall, not too shabby Google!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great app,really helps motivate me! My only gripe (and it's a big one) is that it's really frustrating to finish a workout (for me a run) having used the workout tracker to see that the location tracking is abyssmal. I have location and data on, and it still cannot draw my workout within any sane measures. No, I did not Cross an interstate 4 times and swim through a lake, burning 1700 calories in 20 minutes and averaging a 2 min km. Like.. Aren't there ways you can program in these sanity checks",4.0

A Google user,Functional,I love the app. It interfaces well with my fitbit. Recently they upgraded from move minutes to steps. The move minutes seem a little inconsistant so I think steps are far better than the move minutes. The app contains a lot extra info. It can interfaces with other apps like blood pressure devices to track all vitals in one app. I also think it analyzes and organizes the data better than the fitbit spp. I left off one star because once I had to reinstall it to get it functional again.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really loved this app for tracking my activity throughout the day. Sometimes it messes up and thinks I'm biking if I'm walking quickly...it's an annoyance, but easily fixed. My main concern is that I lost the ability to use a widget for quick reference. I also wish we still had the color coding feature. Some variations of sports are missing that I would like to see featured such as Sprinting, Kata for martial arts or different yoga styles yin vs power yoga. I also would like the ability to specifically program in the exercises I do while weight lifting weights or other rep/set/time interval based exercises.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Significant difference between 1st time use of the update if app was already installed or a fresh install. If already installed, user presented with 3 choices of goals, no adjustments. If new install, user can adjust steps goal +/- 500 steps. The better experience. Strong emphasis on steps, which is an overlap with 2 other apps. However, the opening screen gives status of steps, heart points (formula? ) & move minutes. Would like to set goal for move minutes as well. No map tracks yet.",4.0
Darrell Winger,Functional,"I have always liked my Google Fit app. However, this past Sunday it stopped showing the number of move minutes or heart points I do each day.

It's great that the end time defaults to ""now"" but why make me have to change it just because I change my start time? Rarely are all activities exactly an hour, quit trying to force that!",4.0
Sarah Jones,Functional,"In general, this app works really well! It even has integration with other exercise apps I use and is great for compiling all the information of exercise you've done. Over the past month I've been using the ""paced walking"" function since it tracks a lot more data than the app does automatically. Then thing that knocks the app down a star is that the metronome of the paced walking does not stay consistent as you walk. It adjusts itself to your place, more or less defeating it's purpose.",4.0

After trying trouble shooting steps and finally doing factory reset, i still have no audible staus messages during my workouts.

Even walking at 12 minute my miles I'm not consistently getting them.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,1 star less because of no inhouse sleep tracking and no clarity on how steps get actually tracked when both watch and phone are being used at the same time for walking or whatever.

Jim DeCesaro,Functional,"The tile for workout choices should allow me to select the workouts that are most relevant to my health plan, not the three most common according to Google: Samsung Health at least offers the feature.

Vincent Irwin,Functional,"This app is great at connecting all your fitness apps and devices to store your vitals and fitness data. It allows manual entry as well. What's missing is a focus on nutrition data and any kind of analytical insights.

In other words, lots of numbers but no frame of reference on whether those numbers are good or not for you.",4.0
Elizabeth Evans,Functional,"Great app generally, it really annoys me you can't delete single weights, you can only edit them or delete all weight data. Don't ever sync anything to this app( my experiences are with a bluetooth scale and my fitness pal) because it will probably not sync right and on top of that you will get extra weights records that you cannot delete (from ppl who use your profile on the scale etc).",4.0

Not all users are ready to move to a new app and leave their data behind. They want to have everything in one place. Thank you.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Update - Thank you for the quick response, Google Fit did not have access to storage, granting permissions seems to have fixed the problem. It seems wearing a watch using wear os decreases the amount of steps. I go to bed showing I have 10,000 steps on my phone and I wake up with an adjusted 8,000 steps. Wouldn't be a big deal except I get an incentive from my insurance co. I didn't have the issue of losing steps until I got the wear os watch.",4.0
Glenda Lopez,Functional,"Great app so far that works well for my use. I use it to track steps, exercise (walking and biking), and weight. It has a great UI that's easy to follow and use, and you can set exercise and step goals. I don't give it 5 stars because of the way the exercise choices are listed. First, there are dozens of choices and you cannot search or filter. You have to scroll through all of them to find what you want. Second, the exercises that are there are stored unintuitively. Look at walking. There is fitness walking, nordic walking, paced walking, treadmill walking, and walking. These are all in alphabetical order with other exercises in between, making it difficult to find which walking exercise is best to pick. It's the same way for running, swimming, skating, biking, and other categories of exercise. To make it easier, they should be stored as walking, fitness; walking, nordic; walking, paced; walking, treadmill; walking. This way all the similar typed exercises will be next to each other, especially since there is no search function.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I struggled with a serious problem since Mar 19th, with my sessions not able to acquire GPS from the phone. Finally, today, I found that I needed to enable the Settings/Connectivity/Bluetooth ""Play phone voice call on watch"" option on my watch, and also select ""Connect Carlyle HR"" in the Wear OS app on my phone to assure that the Bluetooth connection is fully functional, and that Fit is again able to acquire GPS from the phone, and properly report the routing, heart rate and distance travelled during my sessions.

A Google user,Functional,"Updated Review (8/20/19 ****) The issue went away some time after I posted the Original Review below! I am not sure what Google or Fossil or both did to fix the issue. I hope it does not occur again and if it does, it would be great to get some notice of the issue being worked on in Fossil and/or Fit support pages.   With respect to the primary functionality, I am quite happy with the app.   Original Review (8/19/2019 *) On my Fossil Gen 5 watch, the app fails to connect to the backend and hence does not track anything. There is the spinning wheel at the top showing the failing attempts to establish the connection. On my Pixel 2, Wear OS app shows the watch is connected through BT to the  phone. The Fit app in the phone shows an X in the Journal tab watch icon for sync.   Hugely disappointed, since I got the watch for the heart rate tracking in Google Fit. Everything worked for about a week and then the phone and the watch stopped syncing, even though the app in both devices seemed to be working independently. I performed a factory reset of the watch and since then, the watch app has been failing to connect to the backend.   Google, is there any hope for a fix?",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's a good app. The notifications can get a little tiring but not too bad and I think you can turn them off. To be entirely honest; I only use it for the step tracker and I only check it every few days. I would be alot happier with it, if it was easier to get to my step history. If I could just tap on the part where it shows how many steps I've taken today and then it just shows me a week summary, showing me how many steps I took each day for the week and maybe be able to tap on each day for more details; I'd like that. Thanks for reading.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I LOVE Google Fit.  I think the main thing I like about it is that it automatically tracks steps.  Additionally, I have mine linked to my Walgreens account & get Walgreens rewards after so many points, & as stated earlier, even if I don't specifically exercise, such as using elliptical, it still tracks steps automatically & those go towards points for Walgreens rewards.  I like that I can track my weight, blood pressure, activities, etc.  I took off one star because up until recently I never had a problem with it not tracking my steps.Then it seemed to just quit working as far as the steps go.I sent feedback on 2 separate occasions regarding this. After the 1st time I sent feedback, some time later it started working again then quit (By the way, I checked to make sure my 'Track activity metrics' in the Settings was on & it was).    Through trial & error, I have discovered that if I turn the Track activity metrics off, & then on again, it starts working after that.I don't know if it gets messed up maybe after having to turn my phone off to charge it, but I will try to notice if I can figure out when it stops working.I am happy I figured out a solution, but it's still kind of a pain.",4.0

Robert Fish,Functional,"Does a good job. With a few changes / updates it could be better. For example in the area where you can upload your weight, BP etc, it would be great if there were a text field to add a descriptive note associated to the value. Could also add ability to upload glucuse level (and synch with a CGM) and a section to add symptoms, to keep track of health issues, and have documentation ready when U go visit the doctor.

Kiera H,Functional,"I liked this app for the most part, the only slight issue was with the gps tracker lagging but that might have been an error on my part. There is a wide variety of exercises and activities that you are able to log or track which is helpful if you are not only tracking running, swimming, etc. Easy to use as well, haven't come across many problems so far. Would recommend.",5.0
Ruth Houston Barrett,Functional,"I'm enjoying this app; it does everything I need it to do, with no effort on my part. I love the journal feature, showing the map of my route, the steps, minutes, and miles, so I can look at my runs and walks from all angles. I like that it also tracks the minutes. I've double checked the distance in multiple ways and found it quite accurate, usually, with the exception being laps around a track and other quicker turning routes. I enjoy the day, week, and month views. I also appreciate that it tracks workouts that begin before midnight and end after as a complete workout, in the journal view. A+++ 5 stars!",5.0
Cayla Dickenson,Functional,"Update: Google fixed the issue! It's back to being amazing and easy to use. It tracks everything and connects well with my other apps. Def recommend. Especially since they seem to fix bugs super fast! - Old review: Worked great until 2 days ago.

If I dig through the metrics and charts, I can see my correct steps and heart points, but on the main screen it will only show zeros now.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"This is my favorite fitness tracker. I like that it automatically tracks my movement, and it's easy to add additional activities.

The app occasionally doesn't work, but the developer responds quickly when I have technical issues.",5.0
Carl Schwagler,Functional,"An excellent app loaded with features that integrates wonderfully with my smart watch. I used to use a bike tracker, but this does everything that did and more. Distance, speed, mapping of the route, calories burned, all that. It's usage and tracking of ""heart points"" is also a superb (and easy) way to remember to get some exercise, as well as keep track of what you've done to help meet your fitness goals.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,I would definitely rate the app highly. Has been useful to me for many years in keeping track of my exercises. I want to make a suggestion and I really do not know how feasible it would be to enable the feature but I will put it out. It should be a feature which can be used to choose nearby running route randomly based on certain parameters that the user will enter such as distance. The routes could be walkways around the neighborhood near where the user is living.,5.0
Ashley Swafford,Functional,"I absolutely LOVE this app! I wasn't at all familiar with it until I ended up having to purchase a new phone a few weeks ago in which it came pre-installed. I love how thoroughly it keeps track of my steps and burned calories. The format is simplistic, yet vibrant and visually pleasing. The journal feature keeps everything well organized and neatly presented. You can also set personal goals and it'll tell you how close you are to reaching them.",5.0
Teresa Markos,Functional,"My review disappeared. App crashes the second I hit Track Workout, making it useless. After the disastrous Google Podcasts update, this is the second Google app in a month to shoot itself in the foot.

David Joseph,Functional,Syncs between devices pretty well. Been using this for a couple years. Seems like a good foundation for continued development. Location tracking is better than many others. Pretty cool little program. Make it bigger! I'd pay a little something for it but I guess when my watch arrives I'll be using the Fitbit software. Oh well. kinda hate to see this program die off. I'm crossing my fingers.,5.0
Ashley Simpson,Functional,"I just love this app! It's not to over the top with having to enter information, which is perfect because I'm to busy to do that all the time. It tracks in the background. I just have to add in a few extras if i want to. I connected another heart rate app to this one, as well as my doctors patient portal, so they can see all my results and my progress and monitor for any issues i need to know about asap. Truly a great app!",5.0
Larry Simms,Functional,"This app is great!! It's a less expensive way of counting your steps without having to buy a Fitbit or Apple watch, etc. If there was a downside, it would be always having to have my phone on me to make sure my steps don't go to waste. It'd be great if Google came out with a less expensive (but quality) watch/step tracker to count steps.",5.0
David Ross,Functional,"I actually really love this! I'm someone who mostly walks a lot, and doesn't otherwise workout a ton. I installed Google Fit because I was curious, but it suggested some walking goals, and after a few months of usage I've started to find it quite fun to hit the goals every day! had a super smooth onboarding, I didn't have to think about it at all, and it motivates me to walk more! 10/10!",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app is great at tracking everything I do. For those that don't ""run with their phone"" (who does that), it's a simple solution of getting a WearOS device. I have a Fossil WearOS watch and I love it. The Gen 4 is water resistant and doesn't require you to have your phone to track GPS location. You can start and stop a workout from the watch, check your breathing and heart rate, and just generally track your steps. I like the simplicity of the app and also the trend graphs to see changes over time.",5.0
Kevin Laurenti,Functional,"The newest update solves something I've wanted for a long while: manual input of everything. I don't use third party apps to track or measure things so I was always missing out on nutrition info and some of the other things that aren't determined by keeping your phone in your pocket or wearing a watch.

Joshua Via,Functional,"It's possible this is my own fault, and if someone finds a solution I'll change the rating. It appears this app doesn't track sleep at all.

Works Well.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I started using this app this week, and I am very happy with it. It does a great job streamlining the tracking of my exercises and it isn't cluttered with a bunch of metrics I'm not concerned about. Simple and clean UI that is pleasing to look at.

Rick Compton,Functional,Edit** Support team reached out quickly and stated they were aware of the problem. They have since fixed the issue. Working great again.** It was a great experience until a recent update. Now it displays zero steps and zero heart points.

gamer749,Functional,"An excellent app when paired with a Fossil Smart Watch. The watch contains a pulse sensor that continuously monitors your heart rate and the app uses this to help determine calories burn and heart point calculation. Even when you take a break in a workout, as long as your heart is beating fast, you will still burn calories and earn heart points while you cool down. Data is shared with linked apps such as MyFitnessPal and Sleep Cycle to provide a full health profile. Google Fit tracks it all in the journal as well. The smart watch also lets me start, pause and finish the workout without having to pull out the phone. The data migrates to the phone once the workout is complete, though it may take a minute or two over the bluetooth connection. Use this with any smart watch, especially if the watch has the Wear OS operating system. Fitness bands are also compatible, just make sure it can monitor your pulse for more accurate data.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,The app is great. I have a small problem with my Fossil gen 4 watch that I can't scroll through the app with the hardware button.

A notification to okay behind the screen tracks it's assuming with quick fill ins when you slide the screen down. This would help a busy mind like mine who forgets. I'll suggest the others when I remember them.",5.0
vin Cenzo,Functional,"Great App. Does all the basic things you need, and does it in pretty good way. I hope they will introduce a sleep tracking, like ""start"" button just right before you go to sleep, and stop button when you wake up, with the tracking of the noise level, and so on..",5.0
A Google user,Functional,Edit: Since leaving the review my app is now back to working 100%. Stopped working after last update. So I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. Now I can't even get passed the sign in screen. Was using it for adventure sync with pokemon go and it was wonderful. Now it's broken. I've reported feedback twice now with no response or acknowledgement of the issue.,5.0
Ankit Sahu (Goldi),Functional,Gold standard for fitness apps if you just want to measure your walks and track weight. It's very simple and easy to use you can add weight etc from front page by tapping the plus sign. Again you don't get perfect Tracking for other workouts but the app is still good because of its simplicity.,5.0
Tyler Hursh,Functional,This app has been amazing. The thing that it can track surprises me and surprises me more with the accuracy. the heart points are a wonderful touch to. If you are familiar with Fitbit and the zone minutes they use the heart points are almost the same thing. The gps tracking works great to,5.0
Dragan Marjanovic,Functional,"Goals tracking idea is good to motivate person. But app is so unintuitive and hard to do comparative analysis of previous days eg I need endless scrollable graph back in time eg steps/minutes/points per day all shown at ones then swipe left and right, my OnePlus 5T screen is huge and full of useless data in this app. Per week/month stats is pretty useless for me. Why not enabling swipe left right through the graphs/calendar instead of forcing those small arrows hard to tap non intuitive buttons. 4 stars only for effort but I will have to look up for another app. Quite disappointed with the app and really bad UX.",5.0
Marc ThodÃ©,Functional,Very cool app for tracking your steps and counting calories and very fun cause it has notifications that just encourage you to pass your last record,5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love the new Google Fit with Move Minutes and Heart Points;. Counting steps is nearly useless for tracking fitness, it's nice seeing Google supporting a science-based approach to fitness tracking.  Unfortunately my Mi Band 3 does not actually sync heart rate data to Google Fit and and the third-part workaround app (Mi Band Tools) fails to sync consistently.  But this is a problem with the Mi Band solution, not Google Fit.  I also sync a smart blood pressure cuff and scale to Google Fit",5.0
A Google user,Functional,Hey so suddenly this app wont let look at the journal or what's in it. Also it won't allow me to manually start a workout. It just keep closing and then my phone will say its stopped working ? I didnt do anything to the settings. I use this app every day to track my walks and my heart rate. It was working just as it was supposed to until yesterday 04/25. Any help would be very much appreciated.... Thanks in advance,5.0
Adrian Maes (Aday),Functional,The last couple days this app has been having a lot of trouble working properly. I checked to see if it needed an update and it doesn't. This is very disappointing to me.,5.0

muhammad shahid,Functional,Google health is a good app I am using it for the last two months and it gives me good accuracy and making my interest developing to get more and more walk and get good maximum health.

Kiera H,Functional,"I liked this app for the most part, the only slight issue was with the gps tracker lagging but that might have been an error on my part. There is a wide variety of exercises and activities that you are able to log or track which is helpful if you are not only tracking running, swimming, etc. Easy to use as well, haven't come across many problems so far. Would recommend.",5.0

Adrian Smith,Functional,Nice app that tracks your fitness and wellness and manages to do that without shoehorning in some unwelcome money gouging subscription plan.,5.0
Eric Dunthorne,Functional,"I haven't used the app in a while. Many free features are now locked behind the paid version. This used to be quick to use and very useful. Now the free version sucks. It's cumbersome and slow. Things like the ability to scan a barcode shouldn't be locked behind a paywall. Also, the new user interface & anesthetic is awful. It looks like something that would be in a child's game. I'll be looking elsewhere to track my macros. RIP MyFitnessPal you will be missed.",1.0
Protoman Blues,Functional,"Completely Useless. I remember using this app a LONG time ago, albeit, 2016-2017. All the features that were once available for everyone to use are no longer available. Everything now has to be paid for and specifically, the feature to create your own meals. You cannot add the calories, fats, carbs or protein. It makes the app feel like you can't track everything you do in a day. Might as well go traditional and keep track on a notebook at this rate. Ridiculous.",1.0
Michelle A,Functional,"I've used MyFitnessPal on and off for over 10 years, both free and paid versions. This is the worst I've ever seen it. The app is painfully slow, to the point of it being unusable. Basic features that were free for years like the barcode scanner are now locked behind an overpriced pay wall. Hugely disappointing; I'm looking elsewhere for my fitness app needs because mfp is truly unusable for its purpose in its current state.",1.0
D P,Functional,"I've used this for years to track calories and macros, but now am looking for something better. I understand the need to have ads, but now the ads come with sound that is impossible to turn off unless you mute your phone. Super irritating. Worse, they took away once free features like barcode scanning. No way am I going to pay for this when the paid version is such a blatant insult to long-standing customers",1.0
Fehnraal,Functional,The UI is congested and confusing. Nothing seems to be where it should be. The app asks you to switch to premium to unlock more features (75% of the app is locked) every time you open the app. The premium fee for removing ads is $20/month. I wouldn't pay that much for this app in it's current state. The UI alone makes this app borderline useless. The only good thing about this app so far is the quick ability to calculate calories for meals.,1.0
Jordan Reneau,Functional,"Added my lunch, it added it twice. So I deleted the second entry, yet the calories from that entry are still there. UI looks easy\friendly but is actually fairly confusing and difficult. Glad I decided to play with it before spending $80. Which sucks because I was more than willing to spend the money if it did what I had hoped.",1.0
Alex Cape-Jones,Functional,"I used to love this app and it was super helpful. I stopped using it after my premium ran out and decided to come back to it after a while of not using it. I was really really disappointed to see many of the best features are now locked behind a pay wall. The free version was great because it had just enough features to be helpful and the premium version was just that, a much better version. Now you have to pay to get all the basic features. I will be uninstalling as soon as I find a new app.",1.0
Mika Miller,Functional,Got away from my weight loss journey and haven't used the app in awhile. The bar code scanner used to be a free feature which was an amazing. Now it's locked unless you pay for the subscription. It's inconvenient to have to search and specifically type in everything. Disappointing. ðŸ« ,1.0
Michael P.,Functional,"Avoid, unless willing to pay $20/month or $80/year. I used this a while ago and recently tried going back. While I totally understand locking some convenience features (like barcode scanning) behind a premium wall, right now I can't even add in calories or new foods unless found in search. Being unable to do something as simple as create food x for y calories, I am uninstalling and trying something different. Save yourself the grief. Counting calories is hard enough as it is.",1.0
Jade McCulloch,Functional,"Used to be great, until most features became paid features. I barely use the app because of the changes. Edited to add that the feature I miss the most is the barcode scanner. This used to be free and there is no reason for it not to be. I'm sure there's something better than my fitness pal out there.",1.0
Shari Srebnick,Functional,"This app used to be good, now it's garbage from a UX and UI perspective. The free version has been stripped bare and everything is behind a ridiculously expensive pay wall. $20 a month?!? My electric bill is only $40. I'll use Google sheets or excel before I pay $20. Too many other issues to list. Time to find another app because this one is no longer providing any value.",1.0
Jeaneen Armstrong,Functional,It was great until the last update. It won't calculate fat and protein properly for each meal now. I e-mailed tech. They said they were aware and looking into it. But couldn't say when and if it was being fixed. They made it sound like it wasn't a big deal since the daily totals were still working. I track macros by meal. I paid for a year of this app that is basically useless now. Don't waste your money.,1.0
AJ Holtzclaw,Functional,The app isn't very user friendly and does not sync very well even when connected to high speed WiFi. Once your workout is complete you should be able to sync and see your progress. Calorie counting is ok at best. Pay features shouldn't pop up unless you've payed for them and ads are outrageous also pricing isn't fair either would.give half a star but can't.,1.0
James Forbes,Functional,Just got the app today and I'm deleting it. I tried to remove food items I added from the list so I could choose another one that was more accurate as far as the amount of calories. It removed the item but didn't remove the calories. So my total calorie count was completely inaccurate. I had intended to use this app as a calorie counter so the fact that this function doesn't work means it's useless to me.,1.0
Mallory,Functional,Every time I've wanted to lose weight I've used this app. I've used it for years. I came back to it recently to find most things behind a pay wall. Even the scanner... The paid version sounded interesting to me but then I checked the price... $20/month?? Nope. I'll check out the other apps that likely have these features free with ads. I suggest everyone does the same. Not worth that price.,1.0
Lillian Costigan,Functional,"Giving this a BIG one star. Came back to the app after a while of not using it, and the free version has been stripped completely bare. Features that were free, such as the barcode scanner, are now locked behind a very expensive paywall. The free version is bloated with ads, and the interface is much more confusing. The app is no longer designed with usability in mind but to get you to spend money. There are better free calorie counting apps available.",1.0
Michelle Davies Archer,Functional,I've used this app on and off over the last 10+ years. I decided to come back to it for tracking food. I was shocked when I went to scan a food and now I have to pay for the feature. I found that very frustrating that a free feature is now only accessible if I pay. I'd rather just watch an ad or see more ads than have to pay. And to take a once free feature to force people into paying is annoying.,1.0
Scott Taylor,Functional,"Too many features! They've tried to make this into the swiss army knife of fitness apps, and as a result the entire app is bloated and hard to use. I notice in the reviews that whenever someone complains about not being able to figure out some feature, MyFitnessPal responds with a link to an article on the support page. So kudos for being responsive and all, but when your app requires hundreds of pages of support articles, that's a fail.",1.0
Patricia Cepeda,Functional,"More and more features locked behind premium. To upgrade to premium is expensive, and features that used to be free are now locked behind a premium upgrade of $20 a month or $80 a year. If you offered something like a family or couples plan where more than one person in a household could use it, that'd be great. I stopped using it a while ago and came back because I was able to connect it to my watch. But it's no longer user friendly and I'm not paying for just the barcode.",1.0
Jessica B,Functional,"One of the things that annoys me more than anything else is when an app takes something that has been part of their free plan since the beginning, then switches it to a paid feature. The bar scan feature that had free for years is now a paid-only feature. Plus their paid plans are $20/mo? Nah. No thanks. Pass. See ya.",1.0
A Swanson,Functional,"Used to really like this app - the barcode scanner was something that really made it stand out compared to other apps. Now they want $20/month for it??? I have no interest in the other features of the premium package, and it's stupid that you have to pay the entire price to use one feature that used to be free. Also seems way more confusing now, interface-wise. I'd recommend just getting a different app.",1.0
Valerie Wilson,Functional,"I have used this app for over a decade, and it used to be really great! Unfortunately, things have gone downhill in the last few years. Making the bar code scanning option a premium feature was a bad idea, in my opinion, since you can get this feature for free with other health management apps. In addition, the add to go premium has become intrusive on a level I'm unwilling to deal with. I might consider going premium if it wasn't so overpriced.",1.0
Peggy Stewart,Functional,"I have used MyFitnessPal consistently for years. It was one of my very favorite apps, and very useful for tracking my nutrition. The update that they just did has made it completely unusable. I literally cannot figure out how to do anything on it. It won't let me stay logged in, I can't find the food diary, adding or deleting items from the diary is very difficult, and it is visually a mess. I tried to find a different app that would do what MyFitnessPal used to do, and I was unable to.",1.0
Liz -,Functional,"I've used this app for years and loved it, I even happily paid for it! Now even the most basic features like easily seeing the macros per meal, or their combined total for the day (without going to a totally different screen) are behind a pay wall? Come on... I understand paying for new or upgraded features, but charging for the long term existing ones? No thanks. I'd rather find a new app entirely. Can't and won't use or recommend anymore.",1.0
Samantha Oppenheimer,Functional,"I've been using this app for years and years. recently something has gone wrong and it's much more glitchy than it used to be. I pay for and membership. It's very frustrating that all of a sudden it's glitchy about scanning barcodes and other things. I really do love the app. So I'm hoping this one star review will light a fire under someone to fix it and then I will up it to a five star review.issues: barcodes scan, log me out randomly, does't adjust cals per meal when change overall cals, etc",1.0
Joe Dapolito,Functional,I've used this app on and off over the last few years. Returned to it today and found that basic functionality like the barcode scanner is now behind a paywall. Everything I click on pops up an ad to upgrade to premium. It's clear that the developers don't actually care about supporting the users' health or fitness goals and are only interested in figuring out how to force us into buying the expensive premium version. This was my goto app for diet/exercise tracking. Now it's just a cash grab.,1.0
Alex E,Functional,"I was hyped up about this app from YT, and my very first experience with it is that it's super glitchy to the point that it's nearly unusable or even flat out unusable. I couldn't add a meal. I add let's say Chicken to the meal and then rice, but the glitchy app puts two ingredients both of them rice, and if I delete one, it deletes both, and I tried at least 5 times, and I couldn't figure it out. Extremely annoying and disappointing. I wouldn't even bother to consider the premium membership.",1.0
Kylee Raney,Functional,"Edit: Changed 2 stars to 1 Loved the app, hate the greed. I've been using this app for YEARS, and it WAS the most reliable and effective one I'd found. But it's honestly really shady to put the barcode scan functionality behind a pay wall. That functionality was available for free, and you ripped it away from the majority of your users. Absolutely hate that, and now I might have to switch to another tracking app. As I read reviews, this seems to be the consensus. Shot yourselves in the foot.",1.0
Cole Canilao,Functional,"You would think after so many reviews, they would put the barcode back as a free feature. Guess not. Will be uninstalling. Hopefully y'all bring it back as a free feature. You cant expect people to want to use the global and sort through hundreds of similar items to find that exact one, when the barcode scan has always done it. Disappointing.",1.0
Megan Little,Functional,"I was thinking that my premium subscription was due for renewal soon so I logged on to look and it was due at the end of this month. What I was more surprised to see though that the premium fee has gone from $49.99 a month to $79.99 a year. Not worth the price increase. From reading others' reviews, it looks like I will lose a lot of features switching to the free version. Yeah, we can search for a food, but for people who have used MFP for 5+ years with a barcode...it isn't worth it anymore.",1.0
Keep Going,Functional,"I've had this app roughly 10 years when we were asked to download it in high school. They've taken a lot of the functions that made it worthwhile and put it in their ""premium"" plan. I see the speal about searching on the database but it makes it more complicated which is the direct opposite of the point in using an app. So I guess I'll be looking for a new app. Disappointing ðŸ˜ž",1.0
B tte,Functional,"Once was good, now flooded with ads and basic features locked behind a paywall. I wouldn't mind supporting an app with a small fee honestly, but the pricing here for a calorie counting app is beyond absurd, $19.99 a month is pure delusion. That should be what a year costs. That's in the same range as Netflix or MS office. Other better free options out there.",1.0
chuck kozler,Functional,"The app has many bugs. In the app, you can't add multiple excersie events. When you add multiples, it deletes the entry after entry. Food choices are woefully inaccurate or downright wrong. I've contacted support on multiple occasions. They work on it and fix the delete issue, but the problem returns. The data problem I feel is allowing people to add free text. Misspelled and incomplete or just completely wrong. They had told me that premium doesn't have these problems. I can't believe that. I",1.0
Don Shearer,Functional,So I used to use this and it was easy. I re-downloaded and it's a nightmare. Hard to use. Every screen wants you to pay to upgrade cant figure out how to use and especially duplicate entry's. Its Too hard to use. Screens everywhere to update to paid confuse you. I finally deleted it. They made it big time and are very much on their way to messing it all up. Lol,1.0
Hope Whitson,Functional,"Edited to add: no one ever responded when I contacted customer service, and now I can't add any recipes at all. Bad at measuring steps, even when the app gets data from dedicated trackers. No more barcode scan unless you pay something like $80. They took so much of the functionality that was previously free and hid it behind a massive price tag. But why pay that much for an app that never works right?",1.0
Mathew Ghafoori,Functional,"No customer support phone numbers. You can email, but no one responds when you do. Doesn't sync properly with Fitbit app... Emailed support and three days later still no response. Basically pay $80 to have the ability to scan barcodes on what you eat. I'd rather use Google and a notebook at this point.

Hanzgraf G,Functional,"I still use this app because I have a lot of data stored over the years, but basic things like scanning bar codes are stuck behind a pay wall now. A lot of the things you can do on this app you can do on your phone, and sometimes a lot more accurately.

Mathew Maury,Functional,I love the app. I've been a happy user for over a decade. I paid the premium upgrade to maintain scanning ability at substantial cost. I barely use it however I value the data I have been able to compile on this platform. Recently I needed to download by entire data file from the site so that I could do some analysis based on a heart condition I'm dealing with. After numerous attempts to do it online that failed I contacted support. Apparently exporting a .CSV file is too much for them.,1.0
Nathan Luistro,Functional,"They took away the barcode scan feature unless you pay a ridiculous amount of money a year for it. This is extremely frustrating and also has caused too many errors and incorrect information because now it's relying on people to plug the information in accurately, which is NOT working. Almost every item I try and add, the nutrition information is wrong. And yes, I know there is an option to submit updates to the information, but that should not be the user's job.",1.0
Desiree Sena,Functional,"The previous version I had didn't charge you to use the ""scan barcode"" option. now the only way to use that function is to pay for premium.

irma garcia,Functional,"The application itself has become a mess. As everyone else here has previously stated already; bar code scanner now is a premium feature? I've had this application for years and that is one of the reasons why I truly stuck with it. The barcode scanner was a feature that made this app unique and the layout was way better before. Present day the subscription fee is outrageously overpriced! It's ridiculous. The application itself is all over the place, not simple to the eye as before.",1.0
Rana Worley,Functional,"I've used this app for years. Had no issues up until today, when I was forced to update because my app wasn't working. I updated, and it STILL DOESN'T WORK.

Hopefully they will revert the subscription changes and fix the app because...it literally does not work lol",1.0
the.corner.be. like,Functional,"Honestly the app is pretty useless and you have to pay to use it. You can't actually scan anything without paying for it (which was why I got the app and the one thing that stood out from other apps)but you also can't even put in how many calories, sugar, and protein was in something without having to pay. It defeats the purpose of the entire app, might as well not be a free app. The only thing I got out of it is that my ideal weight is not what I thought it was. Also very confusing to navigate.",1.0

Tyler Brankey,Functional,"this app helped me a lot when when I was younger. I went back to use it recently to find that all of the features that made MyFitnessPal work best for me are now part of some ""premium"" package.

Absolutely stupid.",1.0
Emily,Functional,"This app has been my go-to for many years but I think the subscription price is unreasonable. With prices soaring everywhere these days, I have to be highly critical when considering subscription based services.

Most of the other apps will let you just scan a barcode for free. They won't anymore....

Their subscription price is also very unreasonable.",1.0
Sunny Drake,Functional,I have a paid version but it doesn't seem to matter. This app has regular glitches including failure to sync and upload steps correctly regardless of the program you pick.

Hillary Prado,Functional,"I have used this app before and loved it. When I started using it again and was really disappointed. It's hard to read/see. I used the barcode scanner every time i logged my food in the past, and so did my husband. Now the barcode scanner is only with premium, which is too expensive. For people on a very fixed income trying to eat healthier and lose weight, it is definitely not an option. My husband and I will not use it due to this change. Searching manually takes way too long to find.",1.0
Jaimie Chirnside,Functional,"I used this app for years and I'm so disappointed. I have found a lot of the ""verified"" food stats are actually not right.

I absolutely refuse to search through a TON of products trying to find the closest stats because let's be honest, that's what you have to do if you dont scan. Looks like I'll be using a different app now.",1.0
Erin Hurm,Functional,"I absolutely hate that they crowdsourced the barcode database and then turned it into a premium feature, and I cannot believe how much they're charging for it.

Ermina Hill,Functional,"Updated 7-23-23. Disappointed! Just did an update because a feature wasn't working, and I get a screen that wants payment! ðŸ¤¬ This has been a transforming experience. I hated tracking food. I love being able to scan everything or add recipes from online.

Also, would be nice to have more aerobic workouts to log, or the ability to record exercise activity from YouTube.",1.0
Craig Shea,Functional,"Don't get me wrong, the app is nice; good interface. But, requires premium plan to do basic things, like scanning barcodes for food, which costs $80 USD. That's how much fitbit premium costs, and it does 10x more than this app. The value proposition just isn't there.",1.0
Sean Joachim,Functional,"Used to be great... Free with premium features. Now you have to pay to do anything. Cronometer's free plan has the barcode scanner and it gives you the macro nutrients.

Courtney Allen,Functional,"I've been using the apps for YEARS. It was helpful when tracking calories along with my fat,carb, and protein intake.

I'll probably be removing the app.",1.0
Lis Casanova,Functional,"Basically what everyone else is saying. I've been using this app for years, one of its best features was the barcode scanner to look up the portions on an item.

Will be looking a different app to track my macros.",1.0
Ben Smart,Functional,"This was my go to app in previous years, making it easy with features like bar code scan. However after revisiting it following a break, all the features that made it a great tool to use now come at a cost. If you have money to spare it could be great, but it is being given one star since updates appear to have only added ads and require subscriptions for previously free content. $20 a month or $80 a year for a previously free feature (bar code scan) speaks volumes to what the app has become.",1.0
J A (Kelitk79),Functional,"The most essential feature to track your meals is locked behind the Premium fee. You can't scan barcode to record your meals. I find that ridiculous and a cash grab. Manually having to enter your food is tedious, and you get multiple results for the same item, so nothing is exact. I'll just go back to the ""Lose it"" app. The developer will be quick to say that you can search for your food manually for free and you should happy about that. Far from it.",1.0
Faith,Functional,"I've used MFP for years. The newest changes - barcode behind a pay wall, and the outrageous water tracking - a deal breaker. I actually had Premium, but it was a cheap shot to change the barcode scanner. The water app doesn't let you set your own water goal, and screams at you with an obnoxious full screen graphic every time I add water. Not paying extra for less features and a water goal that's archaic. After decades, I've cancelled MFP. Still probably the most comprehensive database, though.",1.0
Joe Grieshaber,Functional,"Used to be a great app. Then the paywall showed up. No big deal until it keeps getting bigger. Now one of the best features of this app, the barcode scanner, is behind a ridiculously expensive paywall. The financial barrier of entry into dieting and weight loss is already bad enough for most people. Just couldn't resist squeezing just a little bit more out of everyone. The search feature being free doesn't really help when you let just anyone put food info in. Hard to find the right one.",1.0
Alexa Stroud,Functional,"Returned to this a couple months ago, and as other reviewers have mentioned, was extremely disappointed the barcode scanner had been removed as a free feature but decided to just log everything manually and deal with it. However, as of the latest update the app is also sending me at least one notification a day about 'new features' that I never opted into and there seems to be absolutely no way to turn off. This is getting real close to a breaking point for me.",1.0
Jennifer LaPenta,Functional,Used this on and off for years to track food/calorie intake. Came back for the food tracking to get and idea of the calorie intake and HATE to see that they took away the barcode scanning and put it behind a paywall. So disappointing. It also feels like they have gone overboard with the amount of ads in the free side to drive you nuts enough to pay. This on again did not last long. I'll just write it down on paper.,1.0
TJ DeQueen,Functional,Had to delete after changes. I have used this app for YEARS. Slowly thi hs began falling behind the pay wall but I liked the app so much I was willing to hold on. Then they changed the style which made it more difficult to use. Then the scanning for items went and that was it for me. I would be willing to buy the app but not have a monthly subscription so I had to delete.,1.0
Sydney,Functional,"They took away the barcode scanner, and the ads are just hypocritical at best. I've literally gotten soda ads in the past. I thought the premium might be worth it until I saw the outrageous price. No one in their right mind could justify that. Just use Lose It, it has more features, is more customizable and their paid version is actually reasonably priced (which proves that mfp is just choosing to be greedy, not that they can't afford to lower the pricing).",1.0
Jacob Snyder,Functional,"Used to be one of my favorite apps, but they have made the free version unusable. It is so bad, I don't trust the pay version is worthwhile. Could handle the extremely intrusive ads, but it is now really confusing, and without the barcode scanner, there isn't much reason to deal with the very bad interface. It is VERY expensive. Death of a great app. The bankers who own it now give no $#!&s about the users. The response below is... Stupid.",1.0
Julissa Minaya,Functional,"I've been using this app on and off for years, and it has always been great.

I would consider paying for this app in the future if family(3+) options exist.",2.0
Cheyenne Baxter,Functional,"Fitness Pal has great features for calorie and macro counting, water tracking, and syncing to other devises like apple watch or fitbit. The reason for the two star is that the use of FitnessPal use to be free for most things, but now they charge you premium in order to use some of those features. I used to be able to adjust macros, scan barcodes, and search foods fairly easy. Now, I have to purchase the ""premium"" in order to do that. It's lame and a barrier to using excellent health tools.",2.0
Allie Boran,Functional,I am super disappointed after using this a few years ago to come back and have a lot of the features be part of the premium membership. Like being able to edit fine and scan barcodes. I feel like those are pretty basic features. Also it is a lot harder navigate the home screen. It seems so much less user friendly. I've noticed a lot similar reviews about the change. The response is always that you can still type in the brand and add it but it used to be free and that disappointing.,2.0
Kim Brown,Functional,"I used this app years ago with great success. Decided to start using it again, and some of the most basic features, like barcode scanning, have been put behind a paywall. I don't mind paying for a premium experience, but that's a bit ridiculous. Also, the new home screen is so jumbled - they ripped off Fitbit's, but not well. I'll be uninstalling and using Fitbit's native food log.",2.0
Jessica M,Functional,"Better in the past. I understand the ads. I understand not having all options available for free. I can even live without the scanner even though I really miss it. But to not having the the protein, carbs and fats given is a big issue. So if I have to total macros and micros myself why not just total the calories myself too and not bother with this app. I will look for another one. I can't pay 80 bucks to upgrade.",2.0
M R,Functional,"My current food tracker is shutting it's doors this next month - checked this one out to see if it'd be a good alternative, but basically everything useful (that's normally free) is gated behind premium, at $20 a month (or $80 a year). Both options are fairly outrageous. I know you can manually enter items instead of scanning, but that's like saying you can ""manually"" get to Walmart by walking. There's better technology to do so, but it's not quite worth that price. The search continues!",2.0
Nichole B,Functional,"Used to be a fantastic ap. I dont mind when UIs upgrade but it's a lot more cumbersome to get to what I need. Having the scanning removed from basic use was the end-all for me. I even tried going to a much cleaner, simpler app with scanning that costs much more because of it. Still unsure which I will use in the long run. The disappointment in the high cost just to scan something makes me not want to use it at all, or recommend it.",2.0
Ms. Williams,Functional,"Disappointed, I used myfitnesspal for years along with other apps. I was extremely happy when you could easily scan the barcode. Now they took that feature away so you can pay $19.99/$79.99 for it, which sucks. I won't waste money just for that one feature. I know devs have to make money, but to give a FREE feature just to turn around and charge is not cool.",2.0
Jim H,Functional,"I would gladly pay a one-time fee to unlock bar code scanning and have that back. I don't care about any of the premium features. MFP user to be awesome. I am not paying a yearly subscription for scanning. Their paywall is annoying. They should have thought out their pay model better, but that's what happens when something gets bought out.",2.0
CR Outside,Functional,Been using it for years. One of the things I really liked was the barcode scan feature. A lot of us have busy lives and it made logging much easier. Unfortunately you took this free free feature away and made it part of the premium package and you want us to pay for it. I don't think so. Maybe it's time I start searching for another app that is compatible with my Garmin.,2.0
Zak Edwards,Functional,1. Everything is behind a pay wall. I mean hey make a good product and ask people to pay. But pretty much the whole app is a pay to really use. Just make it a one time payment of x dollars. Then you can have a subscription for the more personalized options. But to do anything you have to pay 80 a year or 20 a month. For the basics of no ads and use a barcode scanner. I'd pay 5 dollars for the app and the maybe that subscription for the app giving me a meal plan or access to the recipes.,2.0
Kelly Wright,Functional,Really disappointed with the changes they've done. I haven't used my fitness Pal in a couple years so I don't know when they made the barcode scanner feature a paid premium item. They filled it full of ads on every single page so they are already getting money for that. I think I might just uninstall this now after not using it for so long and seeing what it looks like.,2.0
Alex Clavet,Functional,I was pretty happy to re-download this app after a couple years of not using it . I was telling my buddy how amazing it was when I was on a weight loss journey lifting weights . Was very disappointed to see you couldn't scan your items . Can't justify paying that for a subscription to an application right now regardless of how much I loved yal before . Everything is too expensive and little things like this add up. Overall tho it is an amazing app if you want to pay for it,2.0
Paul Andrews,Functional,"Used to work seamlessly & was about 99% flawless. Now, it won't even show my correct daily weight entry plot points on the graph as it cuts off the top & bottom range. I've seen that this is an app-wide issue from other users' posts. What's the point? Cmon, guys. It's just not that hard to fix such a simple bug. Will be deleting soon if it's not fixed.",2.0
Cooper Runstein,Functional,"Used to be great. Now its just an ad for their premium version. Removing the barcode scanner and locking it behind a paywall is ridiculous. That was the single feature that put this app above the rest. Now we're left with a cluttured, unintuitive app that offers very little Google and spreadsheets don't, and quite frankly the user experience there would be far simpler. I refuse to pay for something i used to get for free wrapped in a mediocre at best UX.",2.0
Michael Hepner,Functional,"I dropped 3 stars because this company did something that I absolutely disagree with, and believe it just wrong. They have put features that were included in the free version, behind a pay wall. This infuriates me when companies do this. I have no problem in any way, for a company to have premium only features. This is good business. Add new features to the premium version to entice premium purchase . Removing features from the free version, is BAD business practice. Lost my respect and trust.",2.0
Jason Miller,Functional,"App has made changes of functions in order to enable more profits. I used to use this app every day. The ability to scan barcodes provided a convenient way to log new meals and ingredients. Now you must subscribe to be able to use the barcode scanning function. This is another example of decisions made by a group of executives to raise profits, and it ends up causing people to walk away from a previously good product and never coming back.",2.0
Kelly Guglielmi,Functional,"Too bad they changed it. Ive been using this app for a while, and I liked the barcode scanner and being able to see basic macro information. They must not have been making enough money because they removed those options from the free version. I can't pay $80 or more for an app I use periodically. It's too bad, I imagine they'll lose a lot of users.",2.0
Ashleigh Elizabeth,Functional,"I used to love MyFitnessPal. It was easy to use and navigate. Now you have to pay to use the scan functionality, which makes tracking macros a pain when you have to manually type in what you are planning on eating because you can't be 100% that what you are selecting is correct.",2.0
Christina Erickson,Functional,Great for mindful eating and taking a look at a guesstimate of where your goals should be. I wouldn't base actual needs on this app or trust the accuracy on the nutritional value of foods you can't scan. I don't like that they REQUIRE you to provide access to EVERYTHING on your fitbit app just to link your exercise/steps or they won't link it. MyFitnessPal absolutely doesn't need access to our friends list or other personal data for any reason.,2.0
Raul Andres,Functional,"I hadn't used this app in a while, so I was so disappointed to find out that the barcode scanner is no longer free. I didn't realize how handy it actually was, and not being able to use it drastically changes the user experience in a bad way. If you search the Play Store, there are other calorie counters which have free barcode scanners.",2.0
Adam Casarez,Functional,"The fact that they make you pay to use the scanner feature is ridiculous, as it was a free/key feature before. With this feature locked, the whole functionality of this app requires payment. Yeah, you can still track, but there are other options for that, which I don't need an app for.",2.0
Jen Watson,Functional,"I was really disappointed when the food label scan feature was taken away from the free membership. Would have given 5 stars if still available. EDIT: I have been using the app for many years. I understand I can search foods, I have entered recipes we use often; however, scanning the bar code is much more user friendly especially when there are multiple entries for the same item.",2.0
Bridgette Perrington (Briggymariep),Functional,"This app makes things simple and easy for counting calories, tracking workouts (especially with the use of health apps like samsung and google fit, and their respective wearable devices), macros, and nutrition.... Untill it crashes, or just plain won't open. 8/11 update: neither logging in through Facebook or directly works, app crashes. Clearing cache and data does not work.",2.0
Colton Cochran,Functional,"this app used to be alot easier to use. the barcode scanner used to be free but now you have to pay. the adds sometimes don't have a exit button so you have to close the entire app. I used this app about 2 years ago and didn't have any of these issues, but theyve deleted my old account so I'm not grandfathered out of these annoying features. if it can't be free to try and be healthier it could at least be alot fuggin cheaper.",2.0
Lj Bell,Functional,I loved the app and like others I could deal with the ad's. Especially when your not paying for with the free option was awesome. Then they changed it forcing you to upgrade or not an then more changes for the barcode scanner they took away that was free. After all the changes I was done with the app. Not all of us can pay for things even if it's not that expensive. But it is what it is...,2.0
X,Functional,"I no longer have nearly as much functionality as I used to. I use to be able to scan a barcode & know how many calories I was consuming. It's now locked behind a paywall. Thankfully, I don't change the food I normally eat so they are in recent foods. Otherwise, I'd uninstall this app. Decent logging and I have a better idea of how much calories I can eat and still lose weight. Not the worst thing but can definitely do better.",2.0
Sarah Bard,Functional,"Used this app a few years ago and really loved it, so I decided to use it again. I was extremely disappointed to discover that the barcode scanner has been put behind a paywall. I have since done some research and found several alternatives that include the barcode scanner for FREE. I will be using something else unless MyFitnessPal decides to change this.",2.0
Laura Chromy,Functional,"I used this app for YEARS. The ads are suddenly everywhere, in the middle of food search results, popping up full screen while making entries. It's ridiculous. I have to wait for ads to load before content loads. Also the app has far fewer features available for free now. I can no longer export reports, no barcode scanner (search DOES NOT find everything), can't see all history in charts. Upgrading is not worth $15/mo. I'm now using Cronometer, more free features and cheaper subscription.",2.0
Keara Phillips-Berlin,Functional,"I have used MyFitnessPal for years, and I restarted recently. I was really disheartened to see the app had taken away elements that were once the flagpole tools of the app, like easy user interface and barcode scanning. The interface now is hard to use, and reads like a continual advertisement for their ($80 per year!!) Premium service. I can barely find my daily diary without swimming through ads. This, and the lack of barcode scanner is inconvenient enough that I will likely uninstall.",2.0
Kristen S.,Functional,"When I started using this app years ago, the problem was that their food list was very limited, so every time I ate anything I had to manually enter all the nutrition information. These days, the food list is bigger, but now they are pushing a paid subscription very hard, blocking things as simple as barcode scanning in the free version. There are many similar apps that will provide more for less, so I'll be deleting this one.",2.0
S Noble,Functional,"Used this app on and off for like 10 years. Ability to scan food items was a huge perk from the beginning, and now they have removed that into Premium. Guess the $s they get from their advertising wasn't enough. Every update has made it less and less user-friendly. The only reason I continue to use this is because of my historical data, including food and meal groupings. Clearly removing the scanning capability pushes Premium, but it is expensive. Will be looking for another app.",2.0
Patrick Gee,Functional,"Unfortunately, this app seems to get slightly worse with each update. Things that were free before, like barcode scanning, are now part of the premium version. App is now cluttered and is built without any real functionality in mind. Rather, it is just a tool to direct you to the paid content as quickly and as often as possible. It now has nothing that separates it as being better than the other fitness apps, uninstalled.",2.0
Douglas,Functional,"There were things that I liked about the app but the step tracking aspect was really bad. Theoretically it should be able to just sync up with Google Fit but that only worked about half the time. And because it's not possible to manually edit steps, it's not possible to fix the mistake. I was also annoyed that features that are free on other apps were behind the paywall.",2.0
Jim S,Functional,"This WAS a great app. For years I encouraged others to use MFP. I agree with all the critisms on ""recent"" changes that make this too frustrating to continue using. For me the final nail in the coffin is that we can only see 2 or 3 logged food at a time in the diary view now squeezed between ads and banner wanting us to buy premium. Just isn't usable, so regrettably moving onto something more balanced.",2.0
Danielle Restuccia,Functional,"Still useful for tracking calories, I guess. Like so many have said before me, I took a break and fell off the fitness wagon with multiple job changes, moves, etc over the past 3-5 years. I just re-downloaded this as I remembered how awesome the free version *used* to be (without checking the reviews first). I never paid for premium, and was able to use the barcode scanner and was able to select custom macros. It's too bad this functionality went away.",2.0
Farrukh Khan,Functional,"It used to be a great app. I have been using it on and off for years. Over time, the UI has gotten cluttered, more ads have been added and some basic features, like barcode scanning, were moved behind a pay wall. You do get ads in the free version as well, so not sure why they felt they needed to put more things behind a plan. Anyway, deleted the app, going to find an alternative now.",2.0
Christine de la Cruz,Functional,"Used this app off and on for ages. Whenever I felt myself slipping too hard I always started back up to track. After they put the barcode scanner behind a pay wall (it had been available for ever) I lost all willingness to use it as more than just a weight tracker, which other apps are more than capable of doing without all the extra. Time to find something new. No ðŸ˜ƒ the feature was a convenience thing, that was available for years, and you put it behind a pay wall. Kick rocks.",2.0
Stephen Walker,Functional,"Was a good app and I used it regularly for quite some time. Took a break for a while and decided to come back to it. Unfortunately, now it appears cluttered and one of the most useful features, the barcode scanner, is now hidden in the overly priced premium section. Such a shame this app has slid so far down, especially when there are so many other alternatives. Edit: I've switched to chronometer. Has all the wanted features free, including the scanner, and their pro subscription is only $9/mo.",2.0
Kate Cooke,Functional,"I've used this app on and off for the last couple of years and it was very handy. One of the most convenient features in the free version WAS the barcode scanner. Now you can only access by going to the premium version. They keep saying ""you can still look everything up"", but you get a million entries with varying information (even on what looks like the exact same it). Guess I'll see how long before I get too frustrated and find a new app.",2.0
Kelsey Bahner,Functional,"I've used this app for over a decade. I've always loved how easy it was to navigate. I like that it houses my weight-loss progress and that I can easily connect w/friends. Until about a month ago, I would've given it five stars. That was before they started requiring a premium membership for features that were PREVIOUSLY included (ahem-barcode scanning). If you want to charge for new features, great. But taking away features that used to be part of the basic app seems very Scrooge McDuck, IMO.",2.0
BlackBodianGrl,Functional,"I used the app for years and the barcode functions made it easier to use, especially when you can't find the food items in just a search. It's too much of a hassle to continuously search for items that are hit or miss could be easier to scan in a second, but to pay for a function all of a sudden seems ridiculous. And the premium prices is too high.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"There's so much I love about this app. I lost 80 pounds using it. For that I would give it 5 stars.   However, I finally signed up for the premium version because I'm a nerd and I wanted to export my data so I could perform data analysis. I want to be able to analyze my weight loss as averages over 3, 5 or 7 days and correlate it with the calorie intake. Unfortunately when I export my data it is missing half of the weight data. It only shows back to January of 2018 when I started tracking my weight in September of 2016. It does include the nutrition summary all the way back to the beginning.   I just noticed that the first time I requested all my data it showed the weight data back to 1/1/2018 but when I requested an export today it only goes back to 1/21/2018. It seems that it's losing more data as time goes on.   Note, when I look at my progress in the app it does show all the way back to the beginning.  I've been working with their support for almost 4 weeks now and they can't seem to solve the problem nor can they tell me when they might have a solution for it. This essentially makes the premium subscription completely useless for me since the data is all I cared about.",2.0
Jennifer Running,Functional,"Used to be really good and easy to use. But the bar code scanning was moved to the paid version only, when it was originally free for so long. You can still log food with the search bar but it gives you a bunch of options to pick from all with different calorie and serving size information which makes it difficult and tedious to pick the right one. Without the scanner the app is hardered to use and frustrating. Will be switching to another app ðŸ‘",2.0
Rocky Maher,Functional,"I love the app. It makes keeping up with my food intake extremely easy when I'm doing my minicuts through the season. I am however disappointed to see that the MOST useful feature of the app, the barcode scanner, has just recently been taken off. I don't mind the ads at all. It's to be expected but I felt like the barcode scanner being something you have to pay for was a little much. It was my favorite part and I just can't see paying what they want for that one feature that I miss.",2.0
Michelle Bohin,Functional,"Just adding to the other reviews of I used it a while ago, loved it, and now half the functionality is behind a paywall. Been using it on and off for years and watched more and more stuff stop being free, and couldn't take it anymore once I lost the ability to even just scan a barcode. More ads, and continually being asked if I want to pay premium. Very disappointing.",2.0
Melanie Perkins,Functional,"I've been using MyFitnessPal since I had a smartphone in 2011. I've been a loyal user for years, and it's incredibly disappointing to see how much ads have taken over the app (when it was ad free, that was the primary reason I loved the app). I work in the nutrition/fitness field, so the premium plan is not necessary for me, but it's constantly pushed whenever you do quite literally anything. Also, if it was a one time purchase, I would consider it, however the subscription price is ridiculous!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I have been using MFP for years, and really love the app, but for the past few weeks it has stopped syncing with FitBit the way it used to. It takes up to 12 hours for the meals to sync over to FitBit, when it used to be instantaneous.  I have contacted both MFP and Fitbit and the finger pointing just goes back and forth, with both of them saying it's not their fault, it's the other one. Since so many people seem to be having issues, it's disappointing that they don't fix these problems.  I finally started searching for other calorie counters.",2.0
Libby NightWolf,Functional,"2 stars. I like that it syncs up to computer version. And you can put in your own meals. Unfortunately, turning the free barcode feature into a premium one made it a lot worse. One, turning something free to suddenly cost money sucks. But also because the database is and always was trash. It's mostly user ran so an entry can range greatly. Even ""verified"" entries I've found to be wrong. So it's only useful if you exactly know what's in what you're eating.",2.0
Ahmed Abdullah,Functional,"Great app but the syncing with samsung health step count is a really great feature and kind of key to the whole operation, and this problem has been happening on and off for users for at least a year, there's a forum post about it from August 2019. For me it is now not working. The fact that this doesn't work throws a wrench in the app quality and makes it far less usable. That being said, once it works it's a really wonderful app that's great for weight loss.",2.0
Michael Guynn,Functional,"Update to dev reply: yes, there are other search methods. But your copy/paste is disingenuous and dismissive of the point. **Original** I've been using this app on and off for 10 years - long enough that I remember how great this app once was. Over the years I've watched feature after feature be removed or made premium. Most recently, the barcode scanner, which was an integral convenience. For so long I've been hesitant to switch because of fond memories, but I think this is the final straw.",2.0
John Woodbury,Functional,"I have used this app off and on for years and always enjoyed it and found it helpful and easy to use. Recently, they have disabled the ability to scan barcodes, and made it a feature for ""premium"" users. I've been enjoying the convenience of the barcode functionality for years, but I guess they decided they needed to make the free/ads version worse so more people buy the very expensive premium version. I should find a competing app to give ad revenue to.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"It takes forever to load each time, and often freezes and has to be restarted. It's loaded with extra articles and videos that weigh it down because it's trying to be Facebook. If it would focus on it's primary function of helping to track fitness, it would be a lot better. The food tracker would be great if they could smooth it out. Right now, it can take like 8 minutes to just add a couple things that are already in the log. The bugs aren't worked out yet.",2.0
Andrew Keener,Functional,Phenomenal app and I use it because it's incredibly easy to sync information to multiple platforms. But damnit ... why am I no longer able to scan barcodes? That was a cost free feature until recently. What prompted the change? That was a huge selling part for me. I like your app because of the ease to sync info across multiple platforms. But now ... hell ... I may just use Fitbit. It was a free feature. My issue is the swiftness with which this was done. Without warning after an update.,2.0
E Hart,Functional,"Really enjoyed the app for a while, but removing the bar code scan makes it much less useful. I wouldn't mind as much if your food history was always saved. But when things that I eat consistently are suddenly deleted from my history, it makes it way more of a pain to now have to search for something that I eat all the time instead of just scanning the bar code.",2.0
daniel winkler,Functional,"Been using this app for about a year with both gaining and losing and has worked pretty well. Unfortunately the free version has become completely unusable. I didn't mind the ads, however, not being able to see my macro ratio without premium is bit of an issue since I like to track how much carbs, fats, and protein I'm consuming. Losing the barcode scanner was a bummer as well. I considered buying the premium until I saw the price. I will be finding a new app to use.",2.0
Harriette Thompson,Functional,"The color and graphics are wonderful but I like the old format. I can't even scan the barcode anymore unless I upgrade. The options to go premium is all over the place, I accidentally clicked on it a few times. The navigation bar at the bottom takes up too much room as with the ads at the top. It's hardly any room for the daily diary. l'll make my decision to stay after a week's usage. I really don't like all the changes, I have started searching for another app, been with this one for years.",2.0
Maria Liwai,Functional,"Not digging the new update. I love the database, love being able to track my progress, love the interface with my watch. Can't stand that the ads now interrupt my activities by going full screen and making me search for the little gray X in the corner instead of using the back button to get out of it. The small banner ads were tolerable; the full-screen ads are not. It's only a matter of time until I have a frustrating day & start looking for another app.",2.0
Nerual,Functional,"This is a decent app. It actually works pretty well, but I'm giving it 2 stars because of how it tries to annoy you into paying for the upgrade version. Every single time you open the app, you have to click through 2 pop ups: one promoting the paid version, the other to ""get started"" on adding a meal. It may not sound bad here, but neither pop up is helpful, (even if you want to add a meal, it won't let you multi-select from that menu), and it adds drag to what needs to be an effortless flow.",2.0
Jeremy Davis,Functional,"I used to use this a lot for convenient calorie counting, but when I came back the UI had been truly reduced to something no designer should be proud of. Inputs and confirmations are all over the screen, and the home screen has prioritized ads over important widgets. Most of the tabs are useless. On top of all that, they're going to start charging for barcode scanning. There are much better no-frills calorie counters out there which, despite being free, I would be happier to pay for than this.",2.0
Joe Batchelor,Functional,"I have been using this app for years with great success. This app has been a great resource over the years, but now with the moving the scanner feature to the paid version it has become frustrating and not user friendly. As a busy adult it is enough of a struggle to just to make yourself record you daily progress, we don't need any extra frustration. Can we possibly have a one time payment for the scan feature since it seems every loyal user is upset by the new change. I will no longer recommend",2.0
damian holien,Functional,"I have used the free app for a few years. The web page is fantastic. Sadly the app is not, it's harder to find nutrition info, to change goals, and see daily remaining at a glance. And the ads have gotten progressively more intrusive. But it has been good to help me lose/maintain my weight as a person with hyperthyroidism. By removing the barcode scanner though there is no reason to put up with the ads. There are better apps I can use that have a scanner that do the same thing.",2.0
T. Beaster,Functional,"I'm a long time premium subscriber but I'm canceling my subscription to this app. Since they changed the layout, I no longer find it functional nor easy to use, & I'm using it less and less.

I wish there were a way to revert to the old appearance & layout, or even change settings to see Diary immediately upon login, not a big useless circle. ðŸ‘Ž",2.0
Hannah Bratton,Functional,"The app is extremely beneficial for weight loss because it tracks your calorie and macronutrient consumption. It helps catalog exercise, too. However, the app freezes and crashes too often!!!! It is very frustrating when trying to log food quickly. The premium subscription is too expensive!

It's hard trying to provide healthy meals with low income, not to mention finding additional resources..",2.0
Andy Bartels,Functional,Was better in the past. Now it's confusing. Barcode scanner is gone. I am constantly clicking the wrong area because the layout is confusing. Loved it before - I was just lazy. Now I want to use it and I might as well just use a calculator because I'm quick adding everything. The navigation is so confusing that it's not worth paying to get the barcode scanner. Going to look elsewhere.,2.0
Cathy Jagodzinski,Functional,"I loved myfitnesspal years ago when it was easy to log your food, workouts, etc. However, it's disgusting that they force you to pay for premium if you want the barcode scan option.

Tempted to uninstall tbh.",2.0
Shaun Heckman,Functional,"Well, like most recent reviewers, I'm bummed about the decision to make barcode scanning part of the Premium subscription. I've used MyFitnessPal on and off for many years, and it's always been my go to when I wanted to track my food. However, there are other apps that will still do this for free, so I'll be moving to one of those. Prior to Oct. 1 this would have been a 5 star review. The app really is great, but charging for a basic feature such as barcode scanning is no good. I'm out.",2.0
Pedro Gelabert,Functional,"The app is OK, at best. It is frustrating to log into it on a new device. For some reason it crashes continually, it freezes, and it is an overall pain. After a while it stabilizes, but it is useless until that happens. It does have the largest database of foods, both by bar codes and from restaurants. But it doesn't always work right. Always issues syncing with Samsung health and other platforms. Is it worth all the trouble? I think not at times. The developers have not been able, after all these years, to offer a stable and clean platform.",2.0
Chad B,Functional,"I've used this app for years and it's always worked great. I use the free version, which comes with ads.

Kathleen Abrams,Functional,"Wow, had to change my rating. My son and I are very disappointed with the move to only include the bar code scan to the premium. I've been using this app for a long time, got past the ads, but in a time crunch the bar code was a handy tool. Not interested in the other offering with the premium so the monthly price is cost prohibitive for some. If it was a 2.99-3.99 a month some might consider upgrading. Left the Lose It app years ago.

The issue I am having specifically is that when I try to log my food/exercise, I get an error message saying it cannot connect to their server. My Fitbit a paried device syncs unreliablely. It has stopped syncing with my Fitbit as of yesterday afternoon. I tried logging exercises manually, no luck because it can't connect to server.",2.0
Mayra Diaz,Functional,"The app was working fine until it suddenly started calculating my exercise calories completely wrong. They are way too high. I checked my current weight, height, etc. settings to make sure I didn't accidentally enter something wrong, but all the settings are correct. I also checked my fitbit app and everything is fine there too. I can't figure out what's wrong.",2.0
Jessica Yourdon,Functional,"I used to love this app despite the glitches. But on the same day I'm seeing new pop-up ads that take up the whole screen while adding food, they also announced that they're putting a basic feature to most all other similar apps, behind a paywall. Their scanner that doesn't even work properly a good amount of the time that still seems to often have wrong nutritional data when it does. I'm sorry, but that's just absurd. I've lost almost 40lbs with MFP, but this is a massive disappointment.",2.0
Chelsea Valente,Functional,Basic food tracking app and goals. You can set reminders. I'm sad you have to pay to have some features that were previously free such as the barcode scanning. Another frustrating thing is whenever I try to save a recipe or meal it says unable to save so not always reliable but I'm not sure if it's a technical thing or what but happens more than I like to count and I even paid for a yearly subscription so I don't always get to track my food in the moment.,2.0
Chinwe Carroll,Functional,"Worked fine for a little over a month. Then came the consistent app crashes. That much is reliable. I've had to uninstall and reinstall four times in the past 24 hours...and each new version comes with annoying pop ups pushing me to sign up for premium, which I'm not inclined to do reading the reviews and dealing with the unreliability of the free version. Who would commit that much money to a possibly faulty product?",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's been working well but recently there have been what appears to be server side issues. Following this several of my meals need to be resaved since the calorie count have been changed to -1 and I can't edit them. Amending to 2 stars, too many times I can't even log into the app which makes it kind of pointless. I should just go back to pencil and paper, at least that's reliable. Very happy that I'm not paying for premium.",2.0
Robert Patton,Functional,"I've used this app on and off for years. It helped me on my fitness journey. I liked being able to quickly add foods using the bar code scan option. The new features seem nice, I just wish the scan function was still free. I honestly wouldn't mind paying a reasonable one-time fee, but the membership is way too expensive just for the one function I want.",2.0
Melissa Lambert,Functional,"I used the app before & loved it, but left for a year or so. Frustrated to come back and see ""barcode"" feature has been moved to premium & full screen ads every time I open it. I understand that the company needs profit, but most people (under current inflation conditions) cannot afford $19.99 a month. You can manually search for items to add to diary log, but it is difficult since many haven't been added accurately. If premium cost less, I'd buy, but for now I'm looking for another app. Sadly.",2.0
Steph Wask,Functional,Honestly this app was only good before. Not amazing but for free it was pretty good. I came back after a period of time and now the scan feature is a premium feature? Having to sort through a million and one similar items to find the correct one only irritated me to the point of not tracking that meal. the ability to scan on the go was really the only thing making this app worth it for me. But to each their own.,2.0
Alex Tompsett,Functional,"They locked the best feature of this app behind a pay wall. You now need premium to scan barcodes, it wasn't this way when I first started using it. Took the only value differential they had compared to competitors and completely ruined the experience for the regular person who isn't going to pay. You can still type it in, but it won't be consistent as it was with scanning. Really disappointed in this move. Other than that the app is easy to use and looks good.",2.0
Proud Truth,Functional,"I used this app on and off for over the last few years. I haven't been on in a while, the scan feature was a big part of why I chose this app. Now you have to pay for that featyre really turns me off. I'm not cheap but that was a key feature",2.0
Ryan Brown,Functional,for the most part the app is alright. it tends to not update your steps and routinely loses water counts,2.0
Sean Robertson,Functional,"This app is so frustrating to use. It has a massive library of foods but many are input incorrectly, and it doesn't seem to be curated at all. Since all of the most basic information is hidden behind a paywall, you would expect it to be checked for accuracy, but it's not. The only positive thing I have to say about MyFitnessPal is the Garmin Integration. After a year of the paid subscription I can confidently say this app isn't worth paying for.",2.0
Edward Weston,Functional,The interface is so busy. It is frustrating how complicated basic functions such as editing meals are to do. I should not feel I need to look up YouTube tutorials to learn how to use this app.,2.0
Samantha Holland,Functional,"Loved this app, however now the barcode scanner is not available on the free version I don't really use it. Makes it alot harder to add food quickly, so I don't really use it, i go to use and then get frustrated as can't scan product. Quite disappointed with the app now, as it was one of the best.",2.0
David Del Rio,Functional,In the beginning it used to work amazingly well. Have to say the exercising syncing options have been atrocious and I have been consuming more calories than needed causing me to either stay flat or lose/gain little weight. After going back days and weeks I noticed how bad the syncs were. I combine with other apps. So please fix. If fixed I will update review,2.0
Jill Hearn,Functional,"I miss Livestrong's My Plate. It was so much easier to use. MFP doesn't track my steps when I have my Android's main step counter installed on my phone. Also, I am unable to add a food that is not in the food list. My Plate allowed me to add the calories and micronutrients manually if a food was not in the list.",2.0
Sean L,Functional,"Great app if it didn't continue synchronizing by re-entering modifications by adding automatically the previous meal you corrected, it doubles my calories",2.0
Phoenix Nichols,Functional,Used to be able to freely scan in foods which made this app so above anything else. Now you need to pay to scan in things. definitely downgraded and got greedy for money.,2.0
Matt Williams,Functional,"It's probably better to just start with one of the other calorie trackers. It no longer consistently remembers the foods you added previously, which is the biggest advantage of using an app for me. It's also likely that they will continue to lock features from the free version, which seems to be a bigger priority than making sure basic functionality works.",2.0
Matthew Moulton,Functional,"Went away from the app for a while only to come back to the barcode scanner behind a paywall! This app was easy to use with the barcode scanner, but I am probably going to look for a better alternative unless the developers make the barcode scanner free again.",2.0
Logan Cass,Functional,"Good for keeping track or micronutrients and was amazing until they made it so you have to have premium to do barcode scan Â£15.99 a month is a joke and a gym membership isn't much more. The company seems to have got greedy and are slowly revoking the things that made this app so amazing behind a pay wall, its a shame",2.0
Samuel Lewis,Functional,MFP no longer syncs with common apps. Seemed to be a problem for the past three months. Either fix it or roll back to when it works.,2.0
Parmetheus Rai,Functional,Used to use this back in the day before it was sold off to a soulless corporation. So many features are now behind pay walls and the free user experience is purposefully made to be annoying so they can try to sell you a $30/month subscription. What a joke.,2.0
Wendy Warner,Functional,app is not as user friendly as it used to be,2.0
Jon Testa,Functional,Was exceptional and good for cico with barcode reader for free users initially to try; however now you must purchase to get that and eliminate the initial pop-ups plus ads that riddle it.,2.0

rishikesh gawade,Functional,"I have been using the app for more than 7-8 years but with the last update, the app gets Frozen at login screen.

Debasish Kanhar,Functional,"This is really bad app. I can make do with ads, but there is no point using it when it can't sync across ecosystem.

Richard Kaufman Jr.,Functional,"Only for the food list is why it gets two stars, does not work with FITBIT!!!!! Been logging out deleting and creating new accounts... does not work with FITBIT... I just started using my fitbit to track food, steps and activities for calorie counting... I later got a Garmin and MYP updated their app and the calorie adjustment does work right now. Their support staff is not flexible and will only look at limited data and they have blamed Fitbit and Gsrmin now.... Don't pay for their services",2.0

Alice Walker,Functional,I used MFP years ago and found it good. Just wanted to track my food for a few days to check my calories and macros and found it to now be overly complicated and not able to be customised efficiently. Forces me to count fibre in the carbohydrate total. There is no way to access macros without an EXPENSIVE paid subscription. Doesn't make sense that barcode scans are severely limited in the free version. Couldn't get it to sync to my Garmin account despite a dozen tries. Uninstalled.,2.0
Lance Pearson,Functional,"It's fine. If I actually stuck to my 2250 calories, I would NOT be losing weight. I generally leave at least 1000 calories uneaten and am actually losing weight. Eating very nutritionally dense foods is the key, so you don't feel hungry. If you use this app and continue to eat EMPTY CALORIES, YOU WILL NOT LOSE WEIGHT. This is simply an app that help me track that what I eat. I would say I'm losing weight DESPITE the app. It's a calorie counter, nothing more.",2.0
starfinder42,Functional,Just reinstalled this app recently and now a lot of basic features (such as barcode scanner) are locked behind an overpriced paywall now??!! I was originally using this app because I couldn't afford the monthly fee that other trackers force you into. Really disappointing.. especially these days with everything getting so expensive,2.0
Generic Male,Functional,Disappointed that the ability to track glucose levels and insulin administration along with meals continues to be absent,2.0
Shawn Regan,Functional,"Reinstalled after not using in a while. Still junk compared to how it used to be. No barcode scanning, hounded constantly to pay $20 a month for premium which is overpriced for what you get. The dashboard is overstimulating. Only positive thing about app is the food catalog.",2.0
Chris B,Functional,"App has become frustrating to use. Entries repeatedly sync incorrect after editing or deleting them. Contacted support, they advised they are aware and working on it.

Do not pay for the subscription, it is not worth the headache. Two stars for free version, but huge room for improvements.",2.0

Kayla Hrabe,Functional,Too expensive. This app used to be a wonderful app to track food with. It was easy to use and beginer friendly however now its too expensive.

Any other ""paid"" feature is irrelevant to successfully completing my fitness goals and I call on the creators to reinstate the barcode scanner to the free version.",2.0
Eric Brown,Functional,I've used this for years and found it to be very useful but now they've allowed so many inaccurate listings it's making this app almost unusable. I usually have to enter in the nutritional information myself because of this. I think I'll go back to using the Fitbit app.,2.0
Kerstin,Functional,"I used this app for a number of years and by far preferred it to many others. The barcode scanner function moved to premium for $80/year, which is crazy to me when similar apps still provide barcode scanning for free. I did the 30 day trial to see if it was worth the premium price to stick with my loyalty to this app but unless you're in training and using the other premium options, it's not worth it anymore. Hoping developers will reconsider their criteria for paid subscriptions in future.",2.0
Ellen,Functional,"Used to be good. Now nothing is free, and the monthly Â£15 is a rip off. How is nurtrition daily percentage now a premium feature?!

Sorting foods by recency doesn't actually do that - it seems like it sorts it by recency of the *first time* you ate that food instead - mistake. The subscription price should be around $3/mo.",3.0
Matthew Byrd,Functional,"What was once a great app is now subpar at best. It gets the job done at the end of the day, but increasing ads and the removal of the scan a barcode feature unless you're willing to pay 20 dollars a month is absurd. Search results often don't bring up what you type in or bring up a slew of incorrect nutrition options that never seem to get corrected(or take forever to get corrected) even after painstakingly plugging in half of the incorrect information. It will track your cals but stress you",3.0
Colin,Functional,"The app is decent. Ads are a little intrusive. I hate that they took away the barcode scanner from the free version and put it behind premium. If the premium (ad-free) version was cheaper than $80/year, I would buy. The price is a little steep for not much in return.",3.0
Alex Rubenstein,Functional,"I think this is a great app and I feel bad for only giving three stars, but it was recommended to me by a healthcare professional.

Ken Senter,Functional,"Good enough app that I paid for premium after the trial. But it loses two stars for me. 1) For the price it should be easier to use. If what I'm tracking has a barcode then it's very easy and often matches the nutrition info on the package (but not always), but it's not as good when searching/recipe building, too many wildly different choices and it's difficult to know what's right. 2) It notifies me that I forgot to track a meal almost half the time when I have already tracked the meal.",3.0
Joelle arrington,Functional,Loved the app. Been using it for years. Probably a decade or longer. Can't use barcode scanner anymore. It's moved to subscription. I get it. They want money. But I'll just move to a free app. The number of advertisements to get the paid version is so overbearing the free version isn't even worth using now. It's an amazing app. I'd pay a one time fee to own it outright. But I'm just not a subscription based person.,3.0
Duane Metzger,Functional,I've had good luck staying at goal weight. Tonight I'm frustrated because it won't let me log in and the change my password feature doesn't work either.

Savannah Dube,Functional,"I've used this app for almost 5 years now, on and off. I restarted my health journey and was disappointed to find that barcode scanning is now a paid feature when it used to be free.

Mindy Ullstrom,Functional,All these features used to be free and having used it for many years helped build the database. Now you have to pay to use the scan feature and a lot of features that used to be free and now charged for. Luckily the foods I used most are saved as my foods or recipes. I like that you can build recipes and it calculates out the macronutrients. The database is large and you are able to track what eat which can help you focus on better choices. If all the features were still free it would be 5 stars,3.0
Miss Schatzlein,Functional,"I used to love it more. It's easy to use and I loved it for years, until it recently changed hands and started charging for the scanning feature that used to be free. It was really convenient to find exact food and flavors, so I'm sure a lot of people used it and that's why they decided to charge. Just another kick to the already struggling American people. They have one of the biggest data bases for foods and can almost always find my food to log. Even at restaurants.",3.0
Celeste Cott,Functional,"Duplicates a lot of my food entries, erases my water entries as soon as I put in, so I have to do it again. It kept reversing the macro values of the fat and protein.

Trina S,Functional,I used this app before and it was simple and easy to use but it's been about a year since I used it and it has changed. Now you have to look up the food your eating and you can't use the barcode unless you pay premium price for it. Also everytime you go to enter your food it gives you a pop up about their premium option it's annoying.

Elizabeth Bakalyar Friedman,Functional,"It works well enough and I'm glad they've started to update some of the signals (fat isn't actually bad, folks). I still wish it were more in keeping with current science, but if you already know what you're doing and are just looking to maintain and be honest with yourself about what you're putting in your body, it's an ok way to track things.

Alexandra Amato,Functional,"MFP is solid enough. It does a pretty good job of being a calorie counter. In recent years though, I feel like the scanner has gotten worse, it is hit or miss even though once I enter the product manually it shows up. The price of premium is what ultimately drove me away.

Richard Hatch,Functional,"Like others, I think that removing the barcode scanner from the free version was a dick move, but whatever. More importantly, the crowd sourced database of foods is a total mess. There are so many matches for the same food item and they all have different serving sizes and calorie counts. About 30% of the time, none of them match the label. You can report the entry, but it never gets updated.",3.0
Just Jennifer,Functional,It's alright. Having to pay just to scan a bar code is really annoying. Hoping I can find a free app that will sync with my watch and allow me to scan bar codes without paying. It won't allow you to add any workouts without paying. It sucks at syncing my calories and steps with my watch. Overall it's ok. But still hoping I can find a better one.,3.0
Brianna Choitz,Functional,"I've connected this to my Google Fit account, but it won't transfer my steps over for some reason, so I feel like it's not calculated correctly for the amount of activity I actually do. I'd love the option to at least manually enter my steps. Tons of adds, and I'm not invested enough to go premium. But I was just trying to see if I'd be consistent enough at this to invest in either this or Noom. You get out of it what you put into it. The free version isn't bad, but could be easier to navigate.",3.0
Betsy Daugherty,Functional,"Very disappointed that your forcing people to pay additional $$$$ for the bar scanning. Should have left APP alone, I don't even like the appearance of your so called ""dashboard"". I preferred the old set up. It's so cluttered looking on my mobil phone. I find since you changed to this Dashboard style I have no interest in logging my progress anymore.",3.0
Dennis Brown,Functional,"My fitness pal can count. It can calculate how your exercise affects you calories consumed. It doesn't do a great job when I've tried to enter a recipe into My Recipes. It's frequently inflexible about amounts. For instance, I wanted to add 8 ounces of a particular brand of pancetta to a recipe. Nope. One ounce. That's what the per serving amount was and there wasn't any way to alter it, and there were no 8 ounce substitutes. Inflexibility built in.",3.0
missoulaty,Functional,The app says it syncs all the time but I doesn't and I have to do certain trucks in my phone to get it to recognize my Google Fit exercise data. I'm sure they would say it's an issue that they're working on it that is Google's fault but if you do a little Internet searching the app not linking third party workout data has been an issue for years. They also used to have very basic features they now want you to pay for. Which again the app doesn't work properly so why would I pay money for it?,3.0
Rachael Kennedy-Katz,Functional,"I like the app, but when I used it a couple years ago, there were many things that were included with my free subscription. This past year when I got the same free subscription again, none of those things were included. And I have to pay extra now for things like scanning a barcode on a product of food which I did not have to pay extra for in the past. It's a handy little tool when they're not trying to dime you to death.",3.0
Luke Stitzinger (Lukerdoo),Functional,"Constant sync issues between website and app. The app doesn't automatically pull down or push up calorie tracking data when you open it. You have to force a sync by going forward several days in the calorie tracker section, then back to the current day. Then, it will pull down changes from the web, and sync any changes made on the app. It's frustrating because I frequently don't know how many calories I have left in a day because I'll quickly add food on the app, and it won't show on the web.",3.0
Cassandra N,Functional,"I used it years ago and it was much simpler back then and easier on the eyes. The essentials are still here: database, barcode scanner, nutritional breakdown, weight tracker, but it's like they want to put it all on the front page and it's messy and cluttered. I wish there was a way to post a screen shot with markups showing suggested improvements to make it less cluttery. I will say the database has improved a lot (that's a plus) and it has good features - they're just....everywhere.",3.0
Rachael L,Functional,"It does the basics that I need, but some features just don't work. I've tried connecting my fitbit multiple times for it always to fail, and things built in aren't actually recording calories burned, it just has the name saved. I would appreciate it if it had the name and calories associated with that type of movement, then I just needed to put in time done",3.0
Chad Waldman,Functional,"This app generally does the job. With that said, I'm overall disappointed. Premium is EXPENSIVE! I was forced to use this by my personal trainer, otherwise I wouldn't pay for it. The interface feels clumsy. I want to see macros and calories on the front screen without having to scroll back and forth between what's in view. Recipes are hard to find. No search. So many food items (including green badge ones) have incorrect info. You can report but changes don't take effect immediately. Fix this",3.0
Ben K.,Functional,"Still has the basics, but much less user friendly and putting the barcode scanner behind a paywall is not very cool. Also, seems to frequently forget it is connected to my Samsung Health app. I feel like I have to reconnect it once a month (though it says it's still connected, but it stops reading the data). If it's an issue with Samsung Health, it would be nice if MyFitnessPal would notify me that it's no longer receiving data. Otherwise it's fine, great for tracking calories for free at least",3.0
Brandon Bonewell,Functional,"Generally helpful. Too many bugs. This is a good way to control my eating. Since it the best app out there, I'm surprised at the number of bugs. For example: Larger packaged items are commonly not listed. Cereal has the same calories, whether I buy the 12 oz or 32 oz box. There are usually 5 or 6 listings for the same item when searched by name. Some are mostly blank. I don't understand why that would be listed.",3.0
Shelli Tipping,Functional,"Everything was working just fine until about a week ago. Now when I check my weight progress, the graph is cut off at the top and bottom. I was hoping an update would fix it, butt it's saying the app is up to date. Other than that, premium is super expensive, but without it, I can't scan barcodes so tracking my foods is too much of a hassle. I've paid for a year, but will have to reconsider when my year is up. It didn't used to be this way, so I'm disappointed that we have to pay now.",3.0
Dawn Lackey,Functional,"I've had this app for years and always loved it. They took away the barcode scanner for the free version, so searching for your food (unless previously in the database) is infinitely harder. I rarely find exactly what im looking for these days. It became an ""if its not broken, dont fix it"" situation. Most of the features lag or the app doesnt respond. I can rarely log my weight or finish my diary at the end of the day. I just get a spinning wheel until i force shut the app.",3.0
Christopher Camba,Functional,"This app is great, but recently within the past year some features required premium membership. Example, the bar scanning feature used to be free to use, but now is part of the membership option. I assume this feature was utilized so often based on statistics of the app, so the creators decided to use it as a way to draw more in via membership. I get it it's a business, at least add features that were not on the app and charge for premium. Not with existing features.",3.0
r valdes,Functional,"Doctor wanted me to use the app to track my meals.. from the getgo did a trial on the premium but the cost isn't worth any kind of difference. And while there is a compatibility with my Googlefit, it doesn't always capture the data and manual entry doesnt update correctly. I give 3 stars because its been the only app to keep me engaged enough to keep any kind of tracking.",3.0
Connor Safran,Functional,"The app is very useful as a nutritional tracker but the obfuscation of key features that used to be available in the free version of the app (i.e. barcode scanner) behind an insanely expensive subscription is frustrating to deal with, exasperated by the search feature being questionably useful, in the flood of junk user uploads, and less than up to date database of more recent brands. The practice of retroactively reducing functionality is the problem, otherwise super useful tool.",3.0
Jason Cutts,Functional,"the app is definitely helpful to track food. the biggest complaint I have is the food entries are terrible and many are incorrect. even scanning barcodes with the premium features you still have to double check and make sure the info is correct. MFP really needs to come up with a better way to vet entries, even the verified ones.",3.0
Robert McClure,Functional,"The food scanner is absolutely useless to use. People are also adding food to log that are 2 calories or less which I think clogs up the database that I can't find a more accurate equivalent to the food I'm eating. When I log my breakfast it lunch, later get a notification saying I haven't done that yet and I clearly have. It's annoying. Other than those issues I still use it because it syncs with Google fit. I haven't used their exercises because I prefer fitbod training program.",3.0
Daniel Brinsmade (Danny B),Functional,"This app used to be alot better. It actually included fitness and fitness challenges. I'm not really impressed with any of the UA apps. Making the scanner a pay option is annoying. I don't use the app anymore and it's too pricey with the limited features that unlock, which were originally free. It's not like the advertising isn't already paying for it. The challenges had sponsors, the sponsors paid under armor. But I guess they would rather have their original core users quit.",3.0
Whitney Cramer,Functional,"Was Okay as a Free Platform, worse now that it's Membership based. There are so many duplicates with false information that can be selected it's very misleading for people that are really trying to use this app to benefit their goals with no experience counting macros/calories. It's become even more tedious without the options to add in macros for sugar alcohol/erythritol as a carb. I hope this app gets an overhaul and lowers pricing to something more realistic for how little they offer.",3.0
Valerie S,Functional,"I hate how so many companies make these apps and offer so little unless you ""upgrade"" to a ""premium membership"" which usually costs more than it's worth! Oh, and the ""scan a food"" feature, which USED TO be free, is now no longer available unless you are willingvto spend the $80/year for the premium membership to get it! Fine! Y'all are just making me better at researching and figuring my own stuff out. Otherwise, it's great for keeping track of food and activity.",3.0
Suzie Toanone,Functional,"For some reason, when I search items no results show up. It just stays in a neverending search loading screen. I never had this issue before and it's unfortunate because I like this app. It's helped me to lose weight in the past and monitor my eating habits. I thought I needed to update the app, cleared the cache, restarted my phone... But nothing happens.",3.0
Josephina Garcia,Functional,"I loved this app but gave it a 3 because after several years of using it off and on, now you have to pay for a premium membership to use the barcode scanner. Disappointing!! It's faster and easier in my opinion and sometimes when you type stuff in, it doesn't always come up. Please make the scanner free again!!!",3.0
Michele Raupp,Functional,"I've been using this app off and on over many years. Here are a couple of enhancements I'd like to see: - If I choose to automatically adjust my calories based on exercise, I would also like to decide if my macros are adjusted. They currently auto-adjust, so it looks like I never meet my macro goals. - If I choose English as my default units of measure, I would prefer that the foods in the database also present in English units of measure. I don't want to see grams.",3.0
Love Rae,Functional,"I am not happy with the ""new"" app. I have used this app FOR YEARS and FOR YEARS scanning food into you diary was part of the app NOW its a ""Premium"" aspect??? That's ridiculous!! Also it seems more difficult to navigate when adding food/recipe to your daily dairy. It really discouraging which is way for many years I avoid this app, but I am giving it one last try. I am trying this as well as another app which is a little easier to navigate. We will see how it goes",3.0
yrsokul,Functional,"I have only had a paid subcription for a few days and I am finding a few disapointing features. Bulk loading ingredients for a meal sets a certain measurement value and I have to do a lot of math to figure out what my quantity would be based on the default. It would be nice to have an open list of choices, e.g. intstead of 1.0lb give me options for other measurements. Also creating a workout is super time consuming and really ends up with zero value because calories are only counted for cardio.",3.0
Ashley Ray,Functional,"The basic info of calories goal-food+exercise is layered on top of each other also you can read, not sure if premium users have that issue or not. It's easier to pull out the laptop to log in info into the food diary if you can't afford/not willing to pay for the premium. they fixed the bug that wasn't syncing app/website.The only reason to have the app is to send info to buddy apps that don't seem to be able to talk to websites. I hear the lose it app has a Barcode scanner for anyone interested",3.0
Cliff Loy,Functional,"I loved this app and have been using it for years. The only problem I have is that the progress graph is so tall (since the last update) that it makes it unusable. **** Update: It's been almost a month, and the graph still doesn't work. It does work on their website. I'll use that graph for now. I like the rest of the app though.",3.0
Yarima Valenzuela,Functional,"I used this app for years and I loved it. It helped me lose weight and kept me on track. Unfortunately, everything that makes it great is now behind a pay wall.

Kim Peterson,Functional,I used the app several years ago and I loved it... now it seems harder to navigate.. I'm having issues with being able to see my daily intake...I would delete it but I have to use it in order to qualify for weight loss surgery...I don't know why people have to change things when people were happy the way it was..I scrolled the comments and it took forever just to find one person that's happy with all these changes..it up fortunate,3.0
Amy Podhrasky,Functional,"They've changed the free options and it's not nearly as useful. Can't scan a picture or barcode to find the product, which makes things less accurate. The search provided isn't nearly as accurate or convenient. I deleted the app and am currently using something that allows me to scan.",3.0
Tony Devoto,Functional,"The concept is great. The implementation is not. There are way too many results for a food item, leaving the user hopelessly scanning for the correct one. Even when a bar code scan brings up a result, further checking ""green check"" items reveals the nutrition info is not always correct.",3.0
Andrea DeCarlo,Functional,"Good app so far. However, very frustrated because I'm not able to connect Mapmywalk app to it. It just takes me in a loop that has the connect button but then when I choose it, it takes me to a screen to install it, but both Apps are already installed. Super frustrating",3.0
Beauregard Wang,Functional,"I used to use this app a lot when seeing a personal trainer. The premium options are worth maybe $20 total for a lifetime purchase, so to try and charge that much a month is ridiculous. To put the barcode scanner behind a paywall at all even moreso, especially since it was free for such a long time.",3.0
Kimi Cupcakes,Functional,"Recently, my barcode scanner is unable to recognize Great Value (Walmart) foods. I pay for premium, so this feature needs to work properly.

Candice Jack,Functional,The count for how many calories I have eaten is always over lapped with other words. I am unable to read it. I can only read the numbers of what calories I have left.

Jennifer Lundberg,Functional,"I used to LOVE this app. It has a lot of really great features. My favorite feature is to get a food entry by scanning a bar code. MFP has now made that and other features that used to be free part of the premium subscription, which you have to pay for. And, the subscription costs the same now with the 'added' features as it did before. It feels like a scam to get more money. I do enjoy some of the updates, and I will continue to use it. But I will not pay for the subscription.",3.0
Danielle Louise,Functional,"I have used this app longer than I can remember. I paid for premium last year, and it worked with zero issues the entire year. Now that I have opted to forgo the subscription, it won't save or me to delete recipes and glitches and won't reliably search for or log items. I had these issues prior to going premium. I understand not offering premium features for free, but purposely tanking an app to force upgrades says a lot about the company. Maybe don't offer a free app if you can't be honest.",3.0
Amelia Gearhart,Functional,"Been using MFP for a long time, and it's a great app overall. The nutritional tracking is my favorite feature! However, whenever Under Armor gave up ownership of the app, the company that took over starting charging for features that had been free since MFP was new. Paywalling features that used to come standard is pretty uncool, IMHO. I really miss being able to scan foods ðŸ¥º",3.0
Jason Carey,Functional,"I used to love this app and used it for quite a while years ago. I decided to come back to it and found that a lot of basic features I used to enjoy are now locked behind a pretty steep paywall.

From a generally calorie counting standpoint, it still works well, but I have moved on to another app at this point.",3.0
Stormchylde,Functional,"*Update* I just redownloaded this app after using it several years ago & was disappointed to see that it's much harder to find the foods I'm trying to add, & I can no longer find the exact brands,etc. I don't know why they'd want to mess with a good thing. I'll give it a few days, but I may have to find an app with a better library of foods~~~ Very helpful! Great tool for weight loss! Love the calorie counting feature, so easy to use; it gives you all the nutritional info of the foods you enter.",3.0
AndyandMarisa Willard,Functional,It definitely helps keep me accountable. I am disappointed that it doesn't sync to my glucose meter or support my smart watch/step tracker. I guess I assumed such a well-established app would accept most if not all step trackers by now. I do get annoyed by the constant ads to upgrade to premium for what doesn't seem to be much added benefit at $20/month.,3.0
Nikol Hart,Functional,"Decent app. And I used to use it all the time. However, this app now charges a premium for what other apps offer for free. AND, there are things that used to come with the basic app that I would now have to pay for if I wanted. I considered paying for premium, because I have another fitness app that I paid for and I love the features, BUT, MFP's yearly cost is so much more that it makes no sense. I'll stick with my other apps that offer the same benefits (and sometimes more) for less money.",3.0
Lisa Schmirler,Functional,"I used to love it, you could scan food. Used it for years. Then they decided to require premium to use the scanner. Annoying. Now you have to search for the brand and food, instead of just scanning it. I used the scanner feature for YEARS. So it's the pits to have that feature not available anymore unless you have premium, and you pay a fee.",3.0
Charlotte Hall,Functional,"I liked this app so much better when it was free. Once they started charging so that you could scan barcodes and such, I felt like it because very un-user friendly. Things were not labeled nearly as clearly. I ever up deleting it and getting a different app to keep track of my eating. I did like that it had many places already stored in it so I didn't have to look them up.",3.0
Stephanie Meade,Functional,"I'm annoyed. Good app, lots in the database but all of a sudden, there's no option to use a web address to import recipe ingredients. AND when I do bulk add, if I try to edit an ingredient, it takes me back to where you initially name the recipe and flip the bulk import switch. SO ANNOYING! Also, the app started to go blank at times which makes you have to close & reopen. The app then crashes and you have to open again. Annoying!!!",3.0
Adam Nair,Functional,Each update appears to be making the app clunkier. MyFitnessPal used to be a straightforward easy to use calorie counter but now it's loaded up with so much unnecessary features that the core function becomes a chore to use. Nonessential elements are taking up too much screen real estate in the Diary page making it a frustrating experience.,3.0
ShonowTH,Functional,"THE FREE TRIAL IS A LIE. THERE IS NO FREE TRIAL. When you sign up for a year, it gives you 13 months and charges for the year right away. Deceptive as hell. HOWEVER, the app itself is actually very effective. It'll get on your case if you eat something that conflicts with whatever goals you have, and without any exercise, I lost about 15 pounds in a month when I used this. I'll come back to it because it IS a great system despite how horribly unorganized it is - when I have the money for it.",3.0
Lizzi Matisz,Functional,"Its fairly comprehensive and for the free version you have alot of information. However, 3 stars because they took away the barcode scanning for the free version.

Regina Filange,Functional,I've been using this app for years and absolutely loved the bar scanner. It was so convenient. I'm not moving over to the premium version just for the scanner (the ads to bother me that much). I would leave this app to go to another but this one is the only one that syncs with my health insurance app to get credit for my daily/monthly goals. Shame on you for taking this feature away for us free users.,3.0
Jimmy Maches,Functional,"Like a lot of other people, I've been using this app for years and it has helped me lose and maintain my weight and fitness. With the newest change making the barcode scanner a premium feature I will be uninstalling the app. The premium features just aren't worth the $80/year price tag. Everything is becoming subscription based and I'm tired of it. For those looking for a free alternative, Fitbit app allows barcode scanning for free (at least for now).",3.0
Phil Blevins,Functional,"The app used to be simpler, used to allow barcode scanning without paying 20 dollars a month (unless you have the bucks for a yearly payment) and used to have fewer ads. I get it, they have costs. But if they didnâ€™t spend so much on cluttered interfaces and ""content"" maybe they could charge less or allow barcode scanning in the free version. If I didnâ€™t have 10 years worth of data in the app I'd be looking for something else.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"When the app works, I like it. It was easy to sync up with my fitbit app plus the food database & meal/recipe options are far superior to the one in the fitbit app. However, just trying to log my lunch meal today, the app froze up 3 times & was forced to close. When it didn't freeze up, it took so long to respond, I thought it had already frozen. I find that it freezes up at least once a day. Very frustrating!",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I do like the option to scan food items in although I've found some to be very inaccurate i.e. truly drinks pop up with the wrong nutrition facts. And I like that once you enter cardio it adjusts the calories to it. I'd be more inclined to use this app more often if I didnt have to enter a new exercise everytime I want to track them. I didnt expect to see many vegan options in the food data base , which I'm used to although it would be nice to see more of. I was definitely disappointed with the lack of exercises available to click on in the database of movements. Squat cleans is definitely not a new or foreign exercise . It's more work than it's worth to create a new exercise for every single daily entry . The biggest disappointment was the app not being able to account for calories burned in strength training. If these things were adjusted I'd recommend it to others. Until then I'll continue the old school way of writing it in a book manually",3.0
GM M,Functional,"Not great. Says ""Get plan for free"", but then when you click on it, it asks you for monthly or yearly pay.

Julie Hall,Functional,"Have used this app for many years and it has helped in my weight loss journeys. However, very disappointed in the removal of the bar scan feature from the free version after many years of using this feature.

Also, didn't like the lack of notice about this as many others have already voiced in their reviews.",3.0
Anna McAllister æ¢…å®‰å¨œ,Functional,"Was great, now I'm done with it. I could put up with the ads, and I might even be willing to pay for it if I didn't think the price was exorbitant. What I can't stand is how they keep taking great free features and, when you get used to it, whoops, now you have to pay for it. Used it FOR YEARS and loved the barcode scanner; that's what kept me using it even when it became less and less likeable. Now that is beyond the subscription firewall, so bye bye MyFitnessPal!",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really liked this app, gave a lot of information about all nutritional values, not just calories. Plan on entering your own food though. Maybe 5% of the information on there is right, or half right. And then you have to go through the entire list of every kind of food to compare what you actually have. At least if you want the calories your tracking to be correct. Its really time consuming, which defeats the purpose.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app is good. I can find nearly anything to add calories accurately. It has helped me to get closer to my weight goal. The only down fall is that after a certain time I find I can no longer log in, despite a password change. I end up deleting the app entirely every time. Even after a reinstall and use of a different email I run into the same issue. If it didn't give me this issue every time it would easily be a 5 star app in my opinion.",3.0
Lisa Williams,Functional,"I've used MFP on and off for a few years. It has good basic calorie tracking and I like how it syncs w/my Garmin. But I heavily used the barcode scanner, which is now only on the paid version. I was willing to try but it's steep at $20/month. Now it's so much more burdensome to track food. I struggle w/tracking consistently and often do so while on the run. Making it more difficult by having to manually search instead of a quick scan pushed me to try alternatives (Chronometer and LoseIt).",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've been using MyFitnessPal, albeit inconsistently, since 2010. The app leaves much to be desired when it comes to finding ingredients for homemade meals. When you're a family that cooks from scratch often, it makes entering meals and saving recipes cumbersome throughout the day. It is nice for logging information, but I hate that some features which were previously free are now premium. I wish there was a simplified version of this app for people who cook from scratch often, and who do not track things like macros. In terms of weight loss it does help act as a deterrent from overeating, and it definitely helps me to troubleshoot my diet when I've fallen off the wagon.",3.0
Colin Banyon,Functional,"I've been using this for years, and the app was really great!! The most useful feature is the barcode scanner that makes logging meals effortless, this used to be an ad-suoported feature. Now they want $20 a month for the barcode scanner, which is about an order of magnitude more than I am willing to pay. Because of this, I'll begrudgingly be switching to a new platform for tracking. That's a shame because the app is easily 5 stars before this change ðŸ˜ž",3.0
Alyssa Warstler,Functional,"I've lost weight with this app. I don't discredit it's usefulness and effectiveness. It allows me to maintain accountability and see where I could improve. However - IT.

If it even syncs.. I updated both apps and nothing is better.",3.0
Madysyn Burk,Functional,"I like the app, it's easy to use and has a helpful widget for quickly adding food, water, and all the other things you can track.

It happens up to 6 times in quick succession!",3.0
Tangerae Hampton,Functional,I love this app. It has really helped me lose a lot of weight and it helps you get a clear picture of your daily eating habits and how that correlates to your weight loss goals. I'm giving 3 stars because now they have made some of the really good features apart of the premium plan like bar code scanner. That really sucks because at least that was just pure convenience and so much more accurate. Now without that you have to rely on if the nutritional info is already in correctly. Kinda sucks.,3.0
Loretta Bee,Functional,"I've been using this app for a long time, and have lost a lot of weight because of it, but for the last few months it's been going downhill. It looks uglier than it's ever looked before, it's buggy and laggy, and the ads are irritating (and occasionally NSFW!), especially the pop-ups. I hate that it no longer syncs with my Fitbit and other fitness apps, and that it's seriously lacking in its options for exercises to add manually. I used to love this app, so this is all very disappointing.",3.0
Debra Cottone,Functional,"I started using this app years ago and come back periodically to see what's new. Over the years it has become less user friendly and overlay complex.

If you are looking for a food and exercise diary, this isn't it.",3.0
Bill Briggs,Functional,Used to be excellent except for producing too many inaccurate nutrient results when searching and entering a food item. Inaccurate info seems to be saved online by users. Makes it difficult to cull the many conflicting and inaccurate search results - have to double check via other sources. Takes time to do. I could tolerate that. Now the new app versions make it too difficult to use by hiding too much of the screen with ads. Will find a replacement. Sad to see it diminish.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Ok as a free app. It's been slower recently than it used to be; ""official"" entries can be incorrect; and the most frustrating part is linking fitness tracking apps, because they stop syncing. I constantly have to disconnect/reconnect them and sometimes that doesn't even work. It stinks having tracked 18,000 steps in one day and the app doesn't even see it. I wouldn't consider premium for this reason.",3.0
Shirley Pulsipher,Functional,"Used it years ago it seemed much better then. Its cluttered hard to navigate most options are there but awkward to find. When selecting food items, the calories and nutrition is all over the place so to me it's unreliable. So if it's unreliable then I worry about the macro data in the dashboard.

Amy Ackman,Functional,"I've used this for years. It's got an easy interface and a great database (which has largely been formed by members). Unfortunately, the last few years, the free version has become more restricted - since under armour took over. They've pushed their subscription. I understand a fee for the complex tasks, but I feel like it won't be long before they charge for something I can do with a piece of paper and a calculator.",3.0
Rachel Neeld,Functional,"Free version does allow basic tracking of food, water, excercise, and weight, which I have used off and on for over 4 years. But there is a lot of content only available with the paid subscription and a lot of ads that I believe go away with the paid subscription. Would be nice if they had a cheaper ad-free subscription option. For reference, the paid subscription, Premium, is either $79.99 per year or $19.99 per month, which feels pretty pricey for an app, so I just stick to the free version.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"While I like the app (and have been using it since 2013), I find the popup ads for the subscription plans intrusive and annoying. They have become even more so in the last few months. I get it. You offer subscription plans with extra features. But I am sick of popups that interrupt me when I'm trying to enter an exercise/food note. Enough, already! This is downright obnoxious. I don't mind an ad in the newsfeed or whatever, but enough with the popups!",3.0
KeishaJ Rob,Functional,"Seems like everyone is disappointed about the same thing. I've been a member on the app for many years and loved how easy it was. I still like the app and it has helped me along my weightloss journey. However, it's disappointing to lose the free scan barcode feature. Not really trying to have another bill in this overly expensive economy. So to end, I will still use the app just less often, looking for things that make like a little easier and this hasn't helped.",3.0
phargs86,Functional,"I've been using the free version of the app for many years. I just like it for keeping track of my calories. Recently, they decided to make you get the premium version if you want to use the barcode scanner. I think that's a mistake on their part. I just switched to the Lose it! app. It lets you use the scanner for free. Moving the scanner to premium was the best thing MyFitnessPal could have done for their competitors.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Serving size entry is too rigid and not user friendly. Not many foods alliw you enter how much you ate by weight. It is much easier to throw your plate on a kitchen scale, add your food, then simply enter the grams of each food item in the calorie tracker, more accurate too. Trying to enter cups (or other volume) of food by .1 increments is not intuitive and often requires doing conversions and other math, which isn't necessarily hard, just takes extra time.",3.0

Jason.G,Functional,It's not what it used to be... It sucks that now you have to pay for the scanner but I just need a rough estimate of my daily calories so it does the job.,3.0
Matthew Byrd,Functional,"What was once a great app is now subpar at best. It gets the job done at the end of the day, but increasing ads and the removal of the scan a barcode feature unless you're willing to pay 20 dollars a month is absurd. Search results often don't bring up what you type in or bring up a slew of incorrect nutrition options that never seem to get corrected(or take forever to get corrected) even after painstakingly plugging in half of the incorrect information. It will track your cals but stress you",3.0
Alex,Functional,This app has really help me see where my calories are coming from. The scan feature allows for quick additions and the database is always growing. I also really like how you can create custom recipes as well as copy meals over. Edit: I've dropped two stars due to the face that the scanning bar code feature that separated this app from the others is now a paid for feature. I also seem to have increased issues with this app communicating with my Garmin app.,3.0

Melissa David,Functional,This app use to be great. But all the things I use to love about this app you now have to pay for. You use to be able to just scan the bar code for a quick and easy way to accurately keep track of your food. I still like this app but might try and find something else.,3.0

And that functionality seems to be missing.",3.0
Jennifer Lundberg,Functional,"I used to LOVE this app. It has a lot of really great features. My favorite feature is to get a food entry by scanning a bar code. MFP has now made that and other features that used to be free part of the premium subscription, which you have to pay for. And, the subscription costs the same now with the 'added' features as it did before. It feels like a scam to get more money. I do enjoy some of the updates, and I will continue to use it. But I will not pay for the subscription.",3.0
Mallori Wolfe,Functional,"Free features continue to be taken away. The app works great for a calorie counter, lots of people add info so the food database is pretty extensive. The weight graph is nice, and the macros, albeit just a bargraph and you have to pay for more insight. Really frustrated with how I can no longer scan barcodes (premiun feature now). If its a feature people love to use, make 'em pay for it, right? Looking for a substitute.",3.0
Harshit Vats,Functional,I just wanted tos say that there should be an option to segregate veg and non veg recipes when browsing for high protien recipes..all i can see is non veg stuff...and it's hard to find the veg recipes.

I still wish it were more in keeping with current science, but if you already know what you're doing and are just looking to maintain and be honest with yourself about what you're putting in your body, it's an ok way to track things.

Nic,Functional,I wish the food diary was on the screen as soon as I open the app instead of having to look for the button. Also I often eat the same meal a few times a week and support showed me how to cut and paste the whole meal instead of having to log every single ingredient every time. Logging food daily is the main reason I stopped using similar apps but the shortcut they showed me saves me a ton of time.,4.0
Olie Gordon,Functional,"Good overall app for intake tracking. I kind of wish there was more customation with the dashboard.

kevin curtis,Functional,"really great app potential,... although some features are premium only,.. I do like that it calculates what you've burned according to weight, sets n reps and adds that to your calorie intake for the day, even though I don't count macro's except for protein, still very nice. overall I'd have to say, not perfect but definitely one of the better workout apps that I've found, good job guys.",4.0

Christene Goff,Functional,"The app has gotten even easier to use.. I absolutely love it, but gave 4 stars for taking away the use of the barcode scanner for free. You have to pay premium to use the scanner now. What a bummer. Developer: I've read a lot of the recent reviews, many mentions about the barcode scanner not being free anymore.

Julianne H,Functional,"I've used the free mfp for years and it's great. It's 4 stars instead of 5 bc they took away my ability to scan barcode labels.

It makes it very confusing.",4.0
shannon washington,Functional,"Used to use this and there's been major overhaul.

Holly Jahangiri,Functional,"A few updates, generally good experience, useful site. Still not sure it's worth the premium price mostly just to ditch the ads. Old bugs (like non-functional links in notifications, or white screen on opening them within the app) STILL exist despite complaints as far back as 2012.

Ari T,Functional,I love that they offer a free version and don't make you use the subscription. They still offer a lot of the features in the free version which is so nice!

Connie Baker,Functional,"Update: 4 1/2 years later, I still use the app. However, it's sad that we lost free features (barcode scanning), and so much has been added but accessed only by paying a monthly fee.

Ytram Kcolrims,Functional,"Pretty good for tracking daily consumption. Takes a while to get the hang of searching up foods and constructing meals but once you get over that it's pretty efficient.

The vast majority of the foods that are on the app have the wrong nutritional info. Don't just scan a barcode and move on, look to see if it is correct. I'mhappily surprised when I scan one and it is correct. I've pretty much given up reporting foods because they never update it.

A Google user,Functional,It can become tedious when you are loading one item at a time in the food diary. A check off box next to items selected would save me a lot of time. Recently used foods is saved which is good but not in alphabetical order so you have to go through the whole list to find the apple. But then its free!Perhaps when you pay none of this is an issue. Having problems connecting my Alta fitbit but again this may only work if purchased. Bar coding is great!! I Love it like to see some improvements! Thanks.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Had it for a week. Definitely helps me track calories and the free version has good options. I've noticed a glitch or two (like foods disappearing) but that's been minimal.

With it, I was able to lose about 35 lbs in about six months, simply through rigorous tracking. I take a star off for two reasons. The first is for some bugs, including not being able to get input from my pedometer app (which is claimed to be supported and worked initially, but ceased and cannot be reestablished). The second reason is the incessant marketing. Near daily advertising for UA products gets a bit annoying. I might be more receptive if it wasn't so frequent. But it's basic human biology that the body and mind eventually drown out constant stimuli.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"A very useful and helpful app to keep track of calories and other diet components (carbs, fats, proteins, sugars, etc.) I especially like and appreciate the gentle but persistent nagging to enter meals, as well as the periodic reminders on daily diet component targets. The only shortcoming I have found is that -sometimes - the food statistics (even those with a green check box, which is supposed to mean the entries have been checked and verified. don't always align with the information shown on the actual food packaging. Differences are not huge, but one of the two has to be wrong.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love this app. It has been life-changing to have such a convenient way to track the foods I eat and how they align with my nutritional goals. Using the web interface I can readily search foods I've eaten in the year and a half since I first downloaded. This release crashes occasionally on my phone, and there are still issues with routing. For example, I'll log dinner for yesterday, and the app returns me to the screen for today. Overall, though, it's awesome.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great app! I'm usually pretty lazy when it comes to keeping track of the foods/calories I consume, bit this app makes it super easy. I love that you can scan barcodes and that there is such a big variety of foods that come up when you search. It really is very inclusive, even when it comes to the options for workouts. The map portion when you search for nearby restaurants could use some work. It misses a lot of the ones that are around me. But altogether, great app. Highly recommend!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"4.5 stars. Easy to set goals and record food. See at a glance what you have left for the day. Simple to look back at prior days or view weekly results. I like being able to create recipes - saves time entering. Two issues: 1) when I change goals, all screens don't reflect them so there are two sets of goals (confusing and not useful), 2) even though I chose very low carb, sugar goals are way high in the nutrient section. I paid for premium but so far only use one feature so may cancel before trial is over. (I was hoping to also use the app to limit salt intake down the road but haven't found a way to do so (yet?).",4.0
Anna Eland,Functional,"I think this is a great way for me to track everything from water intake to excercise. I also enjoy the extra features like plans and nutritional content tracking. The one thing I feel could be better is the list of restaurant menu items listed. There are many times that I have attempted to add an item from a restaurant and can't find it so, I request the menu to be added and then choose something that is closest to my item.",4.0
Abby D,Functional,"Figuring out how to log different foods takes a little bit of learning and can be a bit tedious at first. It gets easier over time though and there is a surprisingly thorough list of food items in their database. Overall it seems to work pretty well! Edit: Have to say, I still like the app but the new interface with the huge blue menu at the bottom is honestly an eyesore. It clashes with the rest of the design and blocks the view of the bottom of the screen since it is so large and curved.",4.0
William Spear,Functional,"Best food diary/fitness tracker/cookbook on the market. Small things like the QR reader working quickly, convenience of making new recipes and workouts is great. This makes something that is usually difficult, and makes it convenient and easy. One of the few apps that made it to my new phone from my old one. Edit: with the new updates, the barcode scanner is now behind a paywall along with some other features. Which is fine, if you are willing to pay. Docking a star for it though.",4.0
Coach Haack,Functional,"Good overall. You can't always enter your exercisecise as you did it. For instance, if I walked at a pace of 3.7 miles per hour I have to use the pre-programmed 3.5 miles per hour. A small thing, but I have used other apps where this feature is standard. That inconvenience is mostly made up for by the excellence of the food log. I have not yet found a food that could not be scanned nor one for which the scanned results have not matched the nutrition facts label. PLEASE keep this up!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"great, when it works! I've had a lot of trouble with 'error connecting to server' when I complete my diary or try to add a food. Even when my internet is fine (both on data and wifi). It's not very easy to find your exercises to enter? That, or I just haven't figured it out yet. Either way, I love it. I dont really use it to diet, but I do enter all my food which helps me be more mindful of portion sizes and recognize my most calorie-dense snacks. good app! Just may need some stability fixes.",4.0
Exoskell NV,Functional,"great for keeping track of calories, fairly easy to use. I'm upset I can no longer scan barcodes with the free version but I guess that's a good way to get people to start paying, so I understand that change. also not good that when you enter workouts, it will give you more calories. if you track your workouts here you can't stay in a deficit, unless I am missing a way to do that. exercise should be separate from calorie counting. overall a great tool and the free version is pretty great.",4.0
Trevor Bednarz,Functional,"This app is great for tracking calories. In conjunction with intermittent fasting, I was able to lose 10 pounds in a month. Really helps cut back on wasteful snacking. My only issue (hence 4 stars, not 5) is that every time I open the app, it runs me through the tutorial of how to add a food. I understand having the first splash screen asking to sign up for premium, but I dont need the tutorial every time the app is launched, it becomes a reason to not open and track foods.",4.0
Andrew Berger,Functional,"I've been using the Premium version of the app for 4 weeks now and overall I'm satisfied. User friendly, great food database, easy method for logging caloric intake, tracking nutrition, creating recipes. One major issue is that the app does not automatically adjust your daily calorie goal as you lose weight. If you adjust this manually, then it resets any other custom settings you have in place. It's a significant flaw that apparently been known for years, but no one thought to correct!",4.0
Patience Graybill,Functional,"The app has made a big difference for me. I'm learning that I can eat the same foods ,just in moderation. Chose this app for its database of foods and easy work-flow. I find it very easy to find and track foods. I appreciate the estimated calorie and macro-nutrient values. The ability to add food by scanning the bar code is amazing! Con is that adding hime-cooked food is difficult. I end up adding individual ingredients. Also, I do not use the fitness tracker integration. Can't speak to that.",4.0
Zombalaya Q,Functional,I love this app! It makes it so easy to track calories and other nutritional stats throughout the day. Food items are easy to find and input as well! My only issue is that I wish it would allow you to make new recipes from already created ones. Some recipes only have a few ingredient changes and it's bothersome to have to input all those ingredients all over again. I also don't like that you can't shift whole meals throughout the day. You have to move them single entry by entry.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Usually works well and easy to use but have been encountering issues today. When I go to log a meal, it will show up twice with no way for me to remove it. Example: I add a glass of orange juice to the breakfast category but the app adds it to breakfast and snack. It also added a different dish than the one I selected. This is the first time I'm experiencing these problems. Have tried restarting but the issue remains.",4.0
Jonah Rabinowitz-Buchanan,Functional,"Free version is a useful app for tracking food. I cant speak to the paid version, but I imagine its helpful as well. My one gripe thus far is that they bombard you with ads to try the paid version. For a while I'd have to opt out every time I tried to add food to my diary. Unbelievably annoying, and in no way convinced me that I should upgrade.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Overall it's a good experience and I've been using it for several years. The fitness tracking is pretty limited though. And there's a big push for upsell even though there are lots of ads. Food database is pretty good for calorie counts, but very inaccurate for other nutrients. It also has a streak that's based on logins, not meals logged, so you have to log on every. single. day, even when traveling or busy. I have nothing better to recommend, but it doesn't delight the way my 5 star apps do.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Very helpful! I love all the features. However, the connectivity to my Fit bit isn't the most reliable. Sometimes it works great and others it won't work at all. The app usually makes my phone run a little slow as well. But, the pros definitely outweigh the cons and those are small prices to pay for a free app that does everything it does. As someone who is trying to be more conscious of what's in all the food I eat and what impact my exercises have, this is a great app.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great app for tracking calories, both intake and calories burned. I love that you can scan bar codes on food packaging to instantly add the nutritional information. I wish it would sync with more 3rd party fitness trackers. I have a Letscom fitness tracker and this app wont sync with it. It's not communicating fully with my Samsung fitness app either. All-in-all it's a great app. It would be better if I didn't have to do so much manual data entry.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app works fine enough of the time that I can trust it for what I need. I have two small complaints. First, of late I have noticed that some barcode entries act as if they scan, but then won't show up in my daily log. second, for those of us that sometimes fall off the wagon and want to start from scratch, the system doesn't have an easy data deletion mechanism.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I like that this app is flexible. It is a great tool for tracking calories, macros, water intake, and exercise. I appreciate that tool. The only thing I do not like about it is when i put food in for instance a large boiled egg there are way too many options and can be confusing which one to pick. The other downfall is when I am looking directly at the package of food and its nutrients and I look it up on this app and it gives me 10 calories more than what the package says. Overall it's good.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app is very nice. However, I cannot see any way to provide diet modifications that would alter one's personal requirements in the macros and nutrient analysis, e.g. low fat, low cholesterol, etc. If this is a function available in the Premium version, they don't say. There are limited exercise options when entering activity. The app appears geared toward fitness buffs and athletes, and seems to ignore other demographics. Most of the recipes on the home page are high in fat, which renders them useless to me. However, this app does a very good job in keeping track of calories and nutrients, and after 2 weeks, I have lost 8 pounds. Not bad.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Some issues have arisen with the app. The goals reset every day which is frustrating. I have to keep changing them back to my goals. Otherwise, the amount of items in he barcode scanner is impressive and very helpful! I like that it syncs with my Samsung exercise app which serves for tracking my steps and exercise/calories loss throughout the day. Some glitches, but overall a great app.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I'm using this app to track my daily caloric intake, which I've never done before. I've found the app overall easy to navigate to find information. However, it can be confusing and lacking when trying to find a food I'm looking for. Unless I can scan the bar code, I have to keep looking for the same food repeatedly. The history list helps, but some kind of management (even just a bookmarking capability) would help out a lot",4.0
Thomas Standers,Functional,"This is a great app for calorie management. The list of foods in the database are incredible! The best feature is the barcode reader. The ability to zero in on the exact calorie count is great. Only one drawback, the inability to change some serving sizes. Some foods do not have grams as a serving size. Instead it might have fluid ounces when it is a dry good measurement. Since I weigh my food intake including liquids, grams should be a choice. Secondarily, ounces should also be available.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great app for tracking meals and getting a snapshot of your eating patterns. Only prob is it's SOOOOO hard to create a recipe! I go in and add the ingredients manually, but whenever I go to save the recipe, it takes me to a different screen and then when I go back to the diary to add the recipe I just put in, it doesn't show up until literal days later. I've run into this multiple times, this is why I only give it 4 stars.",4.0
Laurie Connell,Functional,"Good app for tracking health goals. It let's you track your macros protein, fats, carbs. I like the bar code scanner - makes tracking food easier. I am little frustrated with the accuracy of the items. Many items are entered incorrectly by users. While able to report an item you still need to be familiar with what you are tracking for your diary to be correct.",4.0
Jk Zinda,Functional,"The app works well. It logs food quickly, the scanner works great, and it breaks down nutritional information well. I just don't need all the extra and I would prefer a cleaner screen that started in my daily food log. I do separate workouts, and it is constantly pushing a variety of eating plans and workouts. For me the premium isn't necessary, although I can see why some would like it all.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,Works but has bugs. The calorie tracker has helped me lose 7lbs so far! They need to fix some bugs in the free app though. You can create and save meals so its easier to track the next time you eat it. You can also take a picture of the meals. But all the pictures I have taken of meals are now showing up as pictures of myself under the weight progress section of the app??? Such obvious bugs in a free app makes me very hesitant to ever try the paid version.,4.0
Nayeli Brown,Functional,"I have lost weight while using this app to track my calorie intake. There is a wide selection of foods and there is a barcode scanner as well. I wish there were more fitness apps that were compatible with this app for tracking purposes. I also would have liked it to be a bit easier to create your own work out. Perhaps some gifs of what the work out should look like , for input clarity. Overall a good app. I have had it for over two years.",4.0
Leah Adam,Functional,"I paid for the premium services...Worth the money for certain! It's definitely helping to keep me on track. For whatever reason, it won't let me connect with friends via contacts or Facebook. I've checked permissions both in app and through the actual phone settings. No matter which option I choose, it only ever reads ""Loading. Please wait."" Alsooooo, would be nice if the exercises included Beachbody ones so there's no guessing as to the best equivalent",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Really like this app and all of the data generated from a few days of food entries. Still getting the hang of all of the features. Would be great if it could sort of recommend types of meals or items to eat based off of the days statistics if you've gone over a goal or are under a goal. It may already do this but I haven't found it yet. Anyways, liking what I am seeing!",4.0
Scott Loper,Functional,"I like the food database and the custom recipes, meals, & foods features. The integration with Fitbit, however, is frustrating. In the approx two weeks I've been test driving it, I've had to go through a number of gyrations to keep the two synced. I'm going to keep with it for a bit longer, but if it continues to be a chore I'll have to drop back to nugging it out with just Fitbit to keep things easy and relaxing. ðŸ™‚ I could do 3 stars, but it's generally been ok so I'll go with 4 for now.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great for tracking calories and keeping on track. The app does say I can have more calories than Medifast recommends, so I am still in a trial mode as to which o e is more accurate. It is so difficult when you have a mixed salad with many ingredients as you have to list each ingredient separately. I haven't figured out a way to put this meal together as a group so I dont have to enter every item separately. Portion size is also hard to modify. for example how can I put in 6oz chicken breast",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've found it very useful personally. This was my intro to food journaling. It's kind of like wikipedia where anyone can contribute information - which leads to some weird entries - but overall I like it. The ads are annoying and I was going to upgrade, but rather than a one-time fee like I was expecting, this app charges monthly or yearly, which I was not up for.",4.0
Jordan Argyle,Functional,"I have used this app for several years to help me track the food I eat. It's been super helpful, and barcose scanning to add food was great! Huge user catalogue of food, I rarely found something jot listed. But, I've watched them add more ads over time, which is annoying but I get it - gotta make some money. Recently, however, features I heavily used have been locked behind a subscription or membership for 80/year. This went too far, and I'm now actively looking for a new tracker.",4.0
Brandon Tuesday,Functional,"(Almost) everything works perfectly and it's extremely useful to track macros and calories efficiently and effectively! My only complaint is regarding a bug I've found where I saved a ""meal"" and upon typing in directions/notes, it deleted the saved meal. I had to re-enter all the ingredients multiple times, but eventually just left out the directions and it worked perfectly after that.",4.0
Angela Lewis,Functional,"It has become definitely more user friendly than the last time I tried to use it. I wish it would more easily bring up the things that I choose. For instance my dayia supreme pizza, for which I use the barcode reader but when I try to put in the name the app acts like it's never ever seen it before. So it would be faster if it would add the things that I eat so I could simply bring them up again without having to resort to the barcode reader. Once I've thrown the box away barcodes don't help.",4.0
C Schrader,Functional,"I've used the app for years and have loved it. But the recent addition of putting ads (I think, it just spins and won't open) over the app when first opened makes it a pain. On my Samsung S10+ the ad doesn't open and I have to go through extra steps just to view the contents of the app, whether being the feed, my diary or whatever. Include the ads somewhere else please, not overtop the app itself. This loss of function and ease of use has me thinking of using a different app.",4.0
Diane Fuller,Functional,"I'm finding this app useful and so far, have been losing weight using it and for this, I'm happy with it. I would've given it 5 stars if not for one issue. I connected my Samsung Health app to it so my steps can be counted from either my phone or my Galaxy watch, but it doesn't work. I've followed all the steps and no matter what I try, I just keep getting a sync error. It wouldn't be such a big deal if I could just add my steps manually, but there's no option for that.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Some difficulties in accessing content that is supposed to be visible with my friend's custom added recipes and foods. Still not sure how to do that, even though their profile shows it should be visible to friends. Also cannot copy just one item from a meal to another day. Can only copy an entire meal, which I don't always need to do. Other than those 2 things, the app is great so far. Love the barcode scanner! Looking forward to continuing to see how it can work for me!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Helps keep us on track and make better choices. There are occasional glitches but were able to resolve by uninstalling and reinstalling without losing personal data. I do wish there were actual instructions on how to do things like sharing meals with hubby, but after LOTS of trial and frustration were finally able to figure it out.",4.0
Caro L.C. W.,Functional,"I've used this app off and on for quite a few years. It seems to be the most complete and helpful for me in terms of my needs. The food database is questionable at times, but with a bit of cross-checking you can find the accurate item. 3.3.21: don't like they changed the macro colors. Leaving fats red (a warm color) and changing protein & carbs to cool colors makes it stand out more, and leaves those of us who follow a low-carb diet the connotation of ""fat is bad"" which is an outdated idea.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Easy to navigate, and I haven't found a food it doesn't have yet. Already made a couple personalized recipes to dial in on what my calorie/protein intake is. Adding exercise is easy, and the feed has some interesting recipes. Really is everything I was looking for. Only reason for 4 stars is the absolutely horrendous start I had to get set up & registered, so frustrating I almost threw in the towel.",4.0
George Jones,Functional,"The free version is more than adequate for me. I like the workout demos and recipe suggestions. I like that I can link this to Map My Walk or Map My Run, also Under Armour apps. It takes your height, weight and activity into account and gives you realistic calorie goals. However, it would be nice to get nutrition and exercise management in one place, instead of linking two apps. The ads are annoying, and the app navigation could be smoother. Overall, this is a fun, well rounded app.",4.0
SÃ©abra,Functional,"It was working pretty well until the last update. Now it won't keep track of my steps and exercises on google fit even though it says they are synced. I've reinstalled both apps and it didn't help. So I have to add that all manually every time which is very annoying. Also, since the last update, it won't let me take scrolling screenshots of the main diary page. I thought that was odd. Other than that it's still a pretty decent calorie and nutrition tracker. But folks please fix these bugs!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,Helpful in keeping track of what I eat. Had a few things I noticed where the nutritional value was off a bit so do make sure you look at all that before you select your food item. Calcium was way off on a few things like spaghetti squash for example. There's usually several choices for each item of food so try finding another one if you notice something seems way off.,4.0
Randi Cline,Functional,"I have used this app for a LONG time and have made immense progress because of it. Like everyone else I am super frustrated that I can no longer use the scanner for free. Especially as a super busy mom, that convenience was super helpful. The app is still good. With or without the barcode scanner it still fulfills its main purpose - helping me track calories. I'm bummed but I'm still going to use it even if it takes a minute longer to log. Thanks for a good product over the years.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I am enjoying this ap. There are tons of food options and logging my meals is easy. I think the pages could be more visually comprehensive, I find myself scrolling up and down and I don't understand the ""community"" aspect of the ap. I just want to keep track of my calories. I like that I can link my exercise aps but they do not always sync up, and there is often discrepancy in how many calories I burnt. Looking forward to using it more.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Works great for what I need. Tracks calories. Tracks weight. You can upload progress photos. It has a barcode scanner so you can track exactly what you eat. You can load exercises and it will track calories burned. If you are wanting to track macros, you have to pay for the extension, the free version only tracks calories. The only ""downside"" is the occasional ad. But its really no big deal.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Being able to scan items is great as is menu items for known restaurants which their are many. However, if we make food at home, it does not accumulate items very well or it can take way too much time to enter homemade items made the way you like it. The usually option is to enter each item individually or create menu or dinner items. Most do not make the same things even each week but that can help a lot if you at least create your own menu items.",4.0
Chad Irby,Functional,"This app is great for tracking macros! I have found a few issues though. When searching food items, it won't let you change the serving size until you save the item and go back in and change the size. If I am entering a bunch of items at one time for dinner, I basically have to enter the information twice. Also, the OS app is different than the Android app when it comes to pre loaded items. If I enter the same exact food item and serving size on both platforms, I get a different calorie amount.",4.0
Jessica Bradfield,Functional,"This is the app I keep coming back to, even when I try others. I love it. It's easy to use, and I've lost 29 lbs just faithfully tracking food and exercise. The only thing keeping me from rating it 5 stars is the off and on communication with Samsung health. It's super annoying when it syncs sometimes, sorta syncs others, and sometimes not at all.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app seems really awesome, but it is SO glitchy when adding/modifying food items to the food diary! I have to find something more reliable. I cannot put things in, get an error message, try again, just to have it show up 4 times. I've only used this app for 2 days. UPDATE: I closed the app and reopened it, and it worked fine. Still, frustrating to have to close and reopen the app when you're short on time.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"this app is actually helping me lose weight. it's not too much of a bother to log in foods, the app makes that pretty easy. you have to do some estimating. only concern is that the crowd sourced food items sometimes have dubious calorie counts, so you may have to double check or pick a different food item that better matches what you've eaten. the ability to scan a food bar code is great though!! the ads and suggestions to upgrade have not been annoying for me at all. give it a try!",4.0
Iana Amke,Functional,"Amazing calorie tracking app. It's easy to add food and if you can't find what you're looking for, you can easily add your own meals/recipes. I love that it also syncs with Google fit although on most days, it only syncs my steps but does not sync other workouts especially if the data was uploaded from another workout app. Also, a challenges page would be great instead of having to go through your notifications to find them. And maybe more personalised plan varieties for premium users.",4.0
Darrell Cyphers,Functional,"Got this when making the serious decision to shed that last, stubborn, 10 pounds. Then discovered, to my delight, its pairing with Map My Ride, wedding calories burned with calories consumed. There only critique I have is that the user interface could be made a bit more modern, with more graphic representations and sleeker entry screens. But this is a matter of style, not substance. Good job.",4.0
Bobbi Mauck,Functional,App is really easy to keep track of your calorie intake. I really like that they have added the barcode scanning option. It won't connect with Gloryfit but that's ok because I don't think the way they calculate your steps to extra calories you can have is correct anyway. It saves the meals I enter so I don't have to re-enter them every time which makes things quick.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,Overall it does what it says it does and I haven't seen a need to upgrade to the paid version. It loses a star for still not having step count integration with Google Fit. It transfers exercises but not the basic step count. That's been in their bug list for at least a year and a half; not sure what's taking so long.,4.0
Riley Perry,Functional,"Just figured out how to make my own meals on the app to avoid adding each ingredient individually. The app isn't the easiest to use but it works. The servings are a pain to adjust as it leaves out grams or ounces are certain things and doesn't give you the option to add a ratio connecting the two. Also, the label reader darkens my camera and can only be used in very bright lighting.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I'd very mich like to open the ap to the diary page fist and not the media (articles/receipes/links) page, at least make it an option for the paid app. otherwise, it's pretty good. I'd also really enjoy an ergonomics focused redesign for all the great data, but they still have great graphs and charts to help you quickly understand nutrients for weekly or daily review, it just needs more intuitive data layout and packaging",4.0
Sasha Shame,Functional,"Overall I love this app, and it has been extremely valuable and helping me to maintain my health goals. Like many others here, I feel that removing the barcode scanner as a clear money grab is an unwise business move. Considering that the free version has ads, I think the amount of money gained from premium memberships will not be worth it overall versus the loss of ad revenue that is generated from the free version once people drop the app due to not being able to use the barcode scanner.",4.0
Jodi Edger,Functional,"Used this app for years and was very successful in losing weight with being conscious of how many calories I was taking in. But it has started glitching. Wheel spinning, I tried uninstalling the app and installing it again. It's just not working 100% like it used to. ðŸ˜” I'm still attempting to use this app because it's great when working. Hope the bugs get worked out.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Update: Feb 26, 2020 - scanning barcodes on foods which I have scanned before now displays an error message. I've been using this app for a week and it's awesome to be able to track weight goals and daily nutrition stats.

The weirdest bug is being able to scan a food barcode but not able to add it or keep it added to the day.",4.0
Desiree Tudder,Functional,I've used MFP before and didn't care for it. I gave it another shot (years later) and so far I'm enjoying it. It helps that I have a better understanding of healthy food choices (before I had done ww successfully for almost a year when the plan changed and was no longer working for me. Without the points system I was lost. I didn't understand what made certain foods better than others on the point system). Having at least some kind of nutritional plan helps. App is easy to use once used to it.,4.0
Matthew Moore,Functional,Great way to track calories. But could use some small changes for a better user experience. I'd like to see a way to add food items that I have already entered. Sometimes people eat left overs. It's difficult and time consuming to find the exact item you've entered in the past with such a large database. Also I would like to see a way to manually enter calories and other values. When I make my own meals I can calculate the calories myself. Being able to simply enter that value would be helpful,4.0
Brad Giessing,Functional,"One of the best trackers out there, also one of the most buggiest. Once I connect my step tracker, I have to disconnect it and add it daily for it to continue working. Things randomly disappear and appear. I add 20 oz of water that I drink, it never shows up. I go in at it again and never shows up. I add a third time and there's 60 oz. Same thing with food. I will add something for dinner, and suddenly there's two of them. Then they disappear. And then a few minutes later they're back. Buggy.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Quick, easy, user friendly. Some of the food information is out of date, or not in the system meaning I have to manually enter it all. It's inconvenient that after I enter it all, it still doesn't link it to the barcode. Also, it'd be really nice to enter all the ingredients once, and group them, so from then on all I have to type in is ""egg salad"" or something like that for dishes we regularly eat, the exact same way.",4.0
Isabel DeLaCruz,Functional,"Great app. I just wished it had some features, such as repeating meals (I drink tea every morning) so I don't have to enter them every day. I also wish the foods suggested were a bit more accurate or ""verified"". More often than not, you see the same food item with different details and don't always match the one you bought, though they claim to be the same. Other than that, I've lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks! Not bad :) Update: 4.5 stars! You can now scan the product and get an accurate description!",4.0
Catherine Kirk Horvath,Functional,"Edit: amazing service! I left a review, and had a response within 24 hours. If only other app developers were so responsive. Now that the bugs are fixed, the app works just as I need it to. Even though I don't have the paid version, functionality is great, and I am not overwhelmed with ads. It used to be so good! Suddenly, the app will no longer communicate with Garmin connect even though the setting shows that it's connected. I get an error message every time I try to complete my diary.",4.0
Kevin Lowe,Functional,"The interface could be better as it doesn't feel intuitive when entering data. High marks for the calorie tracking and the huge list of foods. Everything I've entered has been found, right down to select restaurants and shops. The paid for version might be better but I'm happy with the free version.",4.0
Titus Peck,Functional,"App is very useful. As long as you put in the work to count calories. I like the visual of seeing what calories I've consumed and I like there are recipes offered which is very helpful. There are still parts I'm figuring out, like adding my own meals. MAJOR COMPLAINT! I'm finding with some of the recipes don't have measurements. How can food be prepared w/out directions",4.0
A Google user,Functional,This app is fantastic! I love that you can enter in a recipe and say how many servings you had of it. It makes the calorie counting so easy. With other apps i had to try and guess how much of each ingredient I actually ate... The only complaints I have are that they dont have caloeie expenditure for strength training yet and not all step trackers can be synced. The one I have doesnt and I don't want to get a step tracker app because I rarely have my phone in my pocket.,4.0
Jane R,Functional,"Useful calorie tracker with a lot of user inputted foods! Some of the entries are not accurate, some of them are. You need a little bit of experience with nutrition to pick out the best fit for your foods. Advertisements are obtrusive and annoying. Overall, useful fitness tracker that syncs with a lot of other apps! I have mine integrated with Fitbit and Google.",4.0
Kent Chambers,Functional,"It was fairly easy to figure out how to use it. But if you use both app and website there are numerous differences in how you do data entry...nav is completely different. I never could get it to work with Samsung Health. Easiest way to log food is to scan barcode. But it's a guess as to the quantity of the item you're logging. Units of measure are not as always intuitive. I like the pie chart that displays Fat, Carbs and Protein...very useful.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"It has been very easy to track all my calorie intake. Overall, I am extremely happy with it and it has really helped me with the nutrition side of weight loss. Cons: Sometimes you cannot find the measurement type that you are using for the item you are eating (eg. cups vs ounces) which makes it hard to break down or split portion sizes. Also, I find some of the major nutrition facts on everyday foods is missing (eg. Sugar, fiber, etc) and this affects your tally of those items for the day.",4.0
Vic,Functional,"Overall, this is an excellent app. One annoying bug: If I enter an exercise and then edit it, instead of an actual edit, it creates a new entry, so there is then two entries. Example: I do cardiovascular exercise. I input 20 minutes and 220 calories. I end up working out a bit more, so I edit it, changing it to 26 minutes and 250 calories. The bug: It will then show two entries: 20 minutes w/ 220 calories, and 26 minutes w/ 250 calories.",4.0
John W,Functional,"It takes a minute to get the hang of this app, and it's far from perfect. Looking up foods is annoying. The serving sizes take some mental math. If you eat ""foreign"" food, be prepared to add a lot of it. Once you get the gist of it, it's really easy to keep coming back. In the real world, it really does help turn your focus to what you're eating. I have mine paired up with my Garmin watch & app, so I like to see my calorie allotment per day jump as I work out, which also motivates!",4.0
Trish Seymour,Functional,"Great app for tracking calories, exercise, water intake. Like the videos offering tips/tricks/recipes. You can join challenges, groups. Pretty neat for a fitness app. Obviously the free download is FULL of ads; if you're a distracted reader, spring for the premium. Only reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars- can' t delete a mistaken entry in food diary (or I've not been able to figure out how!). But you can go back in & change serving size, so I'll change the mistake to "".05"" of a serving. ðŸ˜ƒ",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Surprisingly happy with it. I was very resistant to using a calorie-counting app, but once I started using it, it wasn't just easy to use, it was remarkably informative! The biggest drawback is that it keeps giving me pointless recommendations. I'm on a low-carb, intermittent fasting regimen and the app keeps giving me recommendations for just a regular calorie-restricted diet. If I could input my specific plan, this app would be perfect!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app has come a long way! It's easy to use and includes an impressive variety of foods. The Friends/social support aspect, sadly, has limited functionality and is too clunky. It would be neat if the deduced what nutrients your low on and populated the recipes with ones that would be help balance out remaining nutrients and macros. For example, after Breakfast and Lunch, if low on protien, potassium and iron, then the app would suggested some recipe(s) that could help close the gap.",4.0
Paul H,Functional,"Great for monitoring calories (and exercise). Very comprehensive. Approach to cataloguing your own meals, etc could be a little more intuitive. Handy to have the widget, but does it have to be so massive and take up so much of the phone's home screen (4x2)?!?",4.0
Cecellia Marshall,Functional,I am bring charged for premium subscription with no way to question it. I did not agree to subscription. You are cheating me.,4.0
Abby D,Functional,"Figuring out how to log different foods takes a little bit of learning and can be a bit tedious at first. It gets easier over time though and there is a surprisingly thorough list of food items in their database. Overall it seems to work pretty well! Edit: Have to say, I still like the app but the new interface with the huge blue menu at the bottom is honestly an eyesore. It clashes with the rest of the design and blocks the view of the bottom of the screen since it is so large and curved.",4.0
Kimberly Mill,Functional,"I really like this App, I got the premium version as soon as possible. The only thing that is bothering me is that I can't connect the app wit my workout app, or with the standard Huawei Healthapp which tracks my steps and is connected with my smart watch.",4.0
Tom Dinwiddie,Functional,"I haved used this app for many years as a daily diary. It does a what I need to track my calories and runs. My dissatisfaction is their monthly cost for premium. If it were $6-7 monthly like most subscriptions, I would support the application. But instead they want a subscription fee on par with Office 365 or Adobe cloud, so I'm constantly looking for another application.",4.0
Oren Katz,Functional,there's a problem to connect the app with Garmin connect service,4.0
Allison Lafleur,Functional,This app paired with my fitbit has helped me lose and maintain my weight. Thank you for fixing the bugs.,4.0
Sil Nessa,Functional,"Excellent tools in this app from food recipes, meal plans, and exercise. They have many fitness trackers you can link too, but I would like to be able to enter manually.",4.0
Rosa RR,Functional,Its great for tracking food. It would be awesome if it included more vitamins and minerals to track.,4.0
Leslie Fleischman,Functional,I'm needing to gain weight so I'm able to keep track of how many I need throughout the day. I do wish I could enter the food when I have to use the quick calorie count or be able to edit the count when I select a food from the list.,4.0
Charles Woodard,Functional,"Very good tool, New to this tool. I am impressed by the functionality of the app and integration with the Garmin watches.",4.0
Austin Danisher,Functional,Really loving the new UI homescreen. The previous newfeed that I never looked at was a bit bothersome. Otherwise I really like the app and the easy scan or search for foods makes this much easier than other apps and filling out the calories.,4.0
Martin Barrell,Functional,Good for tracking calories and checking nutrients. Would be far better if there were not so many apparently duplicate entries for foods (many of which are inaccurate) and a better way of searching. If you want to check a foods fiber content you need to go on website It would be better if there was a way of converting units - if I have 50 grams of a foodstuff but searches only show servings in ounces it would be much easier if it could convert - hopefully this will happen soon.,4.0
Winston Teo,Functional,"Free version provides decent calorie tracking capabilities, targeted at mainly weight loss, with some additional limited features to further aid weight loss goals. The app loses points for constantly trying to shove subscription plans in your face rather than opting for a 'show once a day' route or including a 'do not show again' option.",4.0
Camille Green,Functional,"Maybe I am not use to all the things that you offer now compared to so many years before when I used this app BUT there is just tooo much going on, on the app.",4.0
Debbie Perez,Functional,I love this app for the most part. I just wish there was a way to add recipes and get cal count for them.,4.0
god zed,Functional,"It's the best app I've used for fitness yet.I would've given it a 5 star review but the app does not calculate strength exercises, please fix it.",4.0
Shane Dunn,Functional,"Great app. Recipes are easy to create, I can find most foods otherwise if I can't find it I can simply scan the barcode. I am currently using it in conjunction with Lumen and Garmin. Also good for measuring macros.",4.0
Hilary McKillip,Functional,"Easy to use, fairly intuitive. There are a lot of food choices, so it makes it easy to log. It's a good transition from NOOM",4.0
Lydia Perez,Functional,"This app is good. I can track my daily calorie intake, my foods that I eat and how much protein and carbs they have. The only down side to this app is that even if you workout this app doesn't read it unless you input it and normally doesn't have the workouts I do. Kick boxing, tabata, hIITs. Also some foods are not listened in here and sometimes isn't correct. But you can submit a correction which is nice.",4.0
Damion Flynn,Functional,Great for calorie tracking. I haven't used it in years but recently logged back in. Still a great app for calorie tracking but disappointed some of the things went subscription based.,4.0
Ryan Sedivec (Sedi),Functional,Amazing app but needs to do a better job of verification on certain foods,4.0
Aliaksandr Khlebus,Functional,Useful app for counting calories but have some nice features hidden under not premium account.,4.0
Joni Talske,Functional,"It's OK, but some features are only on web browser and som features are only on the app. I prefer to track calories in a 7 day cycle rather than daily. The app doesn't do that and doesn't tell me the net calories for the last 7 days like the browser report section does.",4.0
Christopher M.,Functional,"Does what it's supposed to do including pushing your data to other platforms. The interface takes some getting used to, and creating your own meals is a bit of a chore, but otherwise a solid app with ongoing updates. Unless you purchase the annual license, be prepared for abundant ads.",4.0
Christopher Ryan,Functional,"Have to give this app 3 stars due to being unable to edit recipes, etc. after adding them to my profile. Will increase stars once this issue is corrected.",4.0
Michelle Matthews,Functional,"I have used this app to lose and maintain weight. I also used it to track sugars while pregnant. My FAVE thing is how it remembers my most used stuff, and making my own recipes/meals. I haven't used the exercise functions extensively, but I appreciate that it links to fitbit to add steps. I wish the Recipes/Meals/Foods tab was higher in the menu or right there on the quick dash. I like the options to customize calories or macro/micro-nutrients (on premium).",4.0
Cyndi Gerstenberger,Functional,I love the ability to log food in the diary. I wish there were more conformed accurate food choice caloric values but overall it's a very good APP,4.0
Shane O'Brien,Functional,"Good app. Have been using it regularly for years. When will they bring back the ""open in browser"" option when looking at blog articles?",4.0
Rebecca Penning,Functional,It is a very helpful app. The barcode scanner is useful. There was a recent update though and I don't know why they made the interface changes they did on the update. It was better before.,4.0
leela varma,Functional,"It's a really good application, keep me in control of my calories. But sometimes it's hard to get right food from the date base if that food won't come with a barcode. Overall I am so happy, it's the best in market â˜ºï¸",4.0
Mary Claire Meehan,Functional,The diary feature is very helpful for managing your calorie budget when you stay faithful with your entries. I do wish there was a way to sync with recipe apps like Yummly.,4.0
Habiba Hammad,Functional,Can you please add other exercise like running on a treadmill ?,4.0

Sandra Middleton,Functional,I enjoyed this app overall. It was great to track calories and had a good variety of ways to add in the food. (I luv the barcode scanner) I was trying to gain weight and it did help me accomplish quite a bit! Only complaint from me? I would reach my calorie intake goals and for some reason it kept deleting the food I put in and would remind me I didn't log certain meals. (Which I did) Overall pretty great app for free! Just needs a little work with the bugs.,4.0

Suzanne Sprague,Functional,"I have been using the free version on and off for 12 years. It has been great for tracking food and watching my macros. I like that you cam add recipes.

Gary Crawford,Functional,My wife and I have the same version but get different search results. Otherwise we like it so far,4.0
Josh Berry,Functional,It is pretty good. Lots of American stuff which can make it hard to pick things but I always aim for the worst. I think it over estimates the amount of calories you burn with exercise so I don't include that anymore just in case.,4.0
Dylan M,Functional,"It's pretty good. Newest updates to the ui are not intuitive however. Unless you eat the same exact amount every meal. I mean I just have to press the back button an extra time now, but still.",4.0
Caleb Rumsey,Functional,"The only thing this app is missing for me is a complete list of essential nutrients, like zinc.",4.0
Darlene Peterson,Functional,I like keeping track of everything. Don't like that I just can't click on the calories for the day to get to the diary. And I wish I could change the apps on the bottom. I use professional every day.,4.0
Ali Beard,Functional,"Good app, recipe management is very useful. Adding foods is a little awkward.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Very nice app. Very useful information keeping me fit. Lately it has been slower selecting the right food entry for the diet calendar, but overall it works well for me. You can create meals that you eat more often which makes it less time using it and achieving the same results. It would be nice if the free version had less ads.",4.0
Wayne Day,Functional,Awesome app. Definitely a fantastic tool to help with weight loss. Very disappointed that net carb mode isn't available outside of US and Canada though.,4.0

Danny Daveggia,Functional,"This app literally might be saving my life like I've lost over 50 lbs in 6 months and and I'll keep using it probably forever at this point. Great app, I don't pay for the full version but you really don't need to, wish it was all free but just the free version works perfectly fine",4.0
Mark Millstein,Functional,"Great app, but their recent update removed that absolute best feature about it: a quick add button from the widget. Rather than open a menu to quickly track anything you want, the button just opens the app. The ability to quickly add and track things really reduced a lot of the friction when it comes to tracking weight, calories, water, and exercise",4.0
Sandy Powers,Functional,"Mostly all good unless you get booted off and have to set up all over again. If working, it's great!!",4.0
Vox Humana,Functional,"Has a quite extensive library of nutritional info on most foods although if you eat out frequently at smaller, local restaurants it'll be quite difficult to accurately track caloric info. For me I've found it to be a good reminder to be more mindful of what I eat and consider my caloric budget for the day, rather than making impulsive decisions based on cravings. The interface is workable although a bit dated, and the ""social media"" aspects of the app are very pointless and behind on the curve.",4.0
Casey M,Functional,"Love the app for food tracking, but it really struggles to track and record calories burned through exercise if you use multiple apps. I use Google fit for steps and Strava for running, and if I have both connected then it duplicates my runs. The calories burned through steps is also super buggy with sometimes saying the correct amount, then after a run it'll suddenly change to 0 cal burned, which makes it hard when aiming for certain calorie targets (especially in a reverse diet). Tips please?",4.0
Frances Robinson,Functional,Little hard to find common brands available here in Australia. But I'm liking this app.,4.0
Sami Hicklin,Functional,"The calorie counter is great, hate the recipie section though.

Louise Hinckley,Functional,"I love this app, it has helped me so much but I give it 4 stars because it doesn't track my net carbs.

Adam Redacted,Functional,I've lost almost 15lbs since starting this app. I'd be more willing to buy it if it were a one time purchase. The monthly or even annual purchase point is a bit of a turn off. Premium not worth it still,4.0
Feisal Ali,Functional,Excellent phone application. However several bugs identified on the web pages like weight starts from 0 on the charts and reports page. On the home page calories shown to two decimal places. WHY??,4.0
Bladed Cross,Functional,"It is a very good guide to keep track of calorie intake and your diet all together. One fault about it though is that for some workouts that you may do it doesn't have already in the system. In this case, it won't know how much calories you burned so you would have to search it up. But I love this app. It is very helpful for if you want to gain weight, or lose it. Gain muscle, or stay the same. I use this app all the time.",4.0
Alicia Flint,Functional,This app is the one I always come back to.,4.0
Rachel Bills,Functional,"It makes tracking calories super easy. I love that you can scan barcodes and get instant info. I use the recipe feature alot, and I wish it were a little simpler to share with my spouse. A couple of times its had issues, but the app gets updated fairly quick.",4.0
Mandy Curran,Functional,"This app is pretty good. There are some glitches right now since the updat like the scanner doesn't always work when scanning foods, which is super annoying.",4.0

Rakshit Ambi,Functional,"Still need more dishes to add, and also the mode of measurements should be versatile.",4.0
Russell Thorstenberg,Functional,The exercise features are good but the nutrition tracking is what sets it apart from other apps. The food database it uses is vast and (mostly) accurate and the recipe creation is quick and easy to use. The weekly graphs and reports give a great at-a-glance view of your goals vs actuals.,5.0
Doug Hansen,Functional,"One thing that I like about the program is that I haven't found a food that wasn't already in their database. I just scan the bar code, and there it is. It makes tracking calories easy. One thing that I don't like, probably a bug, is that adding exercise doesn't remember the precious entry. If I enter a food in, the program always remembers how I previously entered it, even down to the weight, but that feature doesn't extend to adding exercise.",5.0
alejandro vazquez,Functional,"It's unfortunate the barcode scan feature was taken away from the free version, it made it easier to scan foods.

Tracy Johnson,Functional,"I really like mfp but not enough to pay the price of premiem. There are other apps out there that scan barcodes &/or enter foods & nutrician manually for free.

But for those that can afford it & will use it for a year, it is helpful letting you know where you stand at reaching your goal for weight loss.",5.0
Tim Oz,Functional,"I've only been using the app for a few days but so far it seems to be helping a lot with portion control and calorie counting, as well as helping me track things like protein, sugar, and carb consumption... definitely would recommend (although, full disclosure, I'm only using the free version so can't speak to the value of the paid features).",5.0
Brandon Zempel,Functional,This app is addicting in a great way. It's almost fun to lose weight simply by staying in the calorie range. The nutrition information is a game changer being able to see the important stuff. It works. I do wish it would save your foods so no new search every time. This app flat out works.,5.0
Carmen Pinon,Functional,"This app is totally free to try out, there are some extra features of the app. this app overall is great for those that don't want to invest money on something that they haven't first tried. You can keep track of macros nutrients in a daily diary of what you've eaten. It helps you to keep track of your caloric, protein, &carb intake. down the line, you might want to invest into the other features of the app. those features include exercise routines, meal planing, and more.",5.0
Desi Diego,Functional,"Honestly, for its most basic (free) subscription, this app is great. I love it. I just need to stay in calorie deficit so it's perfect for entering any foods to manage this. It also helps with keeping me on track for my fitness goals with entering my exercise as well. Been using this app for about 2 years now.",5.0
J Lorraine,Functional,"Great Fitness App, the best I have tried. Simple, straightforward, convenient, with as much or as little info as you need. I recommend it. Edit: don't lose your password, from my experience, it's been impossible to reset it, and I uninstalled the app, so I wouldn't throw my phone in frustration.",5.0
Jubin John,Functional,"Great features even in the free version. Has all the meals I want, even the Indian ones. They show a check mark to indicate that the nutrient info is very accurate for an item. Love the ability to create your own meals for easy logging and to add custom recipes. They give you quite a bit of micronutrient information. The ads in the free version are tolerable. Would buy the premium package if it wasn't so expensive. One issue is that navigation is slow and a bit clumsy.",5.0
Fel Men,Functional,"Overall this application has worked well. The bugs I have noticed in the past were repaired in later updates. For some reason the check button that adds food would sometimes disappear and I would have to closeout and restart the app. This is no longer a problem. Also, this app helped me lose 40 lbs in 11 months and keep it off since. If it is your intention to lose, gain, maintain, or find a diet that works for you I highly recommend recording your food to achieve those goals.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app helped me lose weight and I cannot be more happy. This is one of the best calorie counters out there. (Even though this is the only one I've ever used) The notifications are a bit wonky, and sometimes you'll have to manually put in what you ate because the nutritional information may be wrong or the product won't exist. I don't think this is the apps fault, though. You can simply scan a bar code on what you ate and I love that. The app has a website version, but the sync sucks. Thankfully, in the settings tab, there's a sync button to sort that problem out. Overall, even with it's slight issues, I definitely recommend this.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Add are not at all disruptive like they are in other apps. Super simple interface with a huge database of foods, the option to conveniently log them by scanning a barcode is great! Good customer support and I have had success with this app. Interesting and informative articles come with it and it really builds awareness of how calories add up and where they are coming from. Not just a calorie counter though-also keeps track of and organizes other nutrients to help you meet your body's needs. You can track water and exercise too all of this in the free version. It's great!!",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great app, love just about everything about it. I have been using it for 4 years at this point and don't have any complaints. The only thing I could think of improvement wise are the overwhelming amount of entries for the same foods, which can also be entered incorrectly. Sometimes they have the verified check mark and are still incorrect. This comes at a reasonable cost though. Also I have always found the subscription underwhelming. If it felt worth it I would subscribe in a heartbeat.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"EDIT: After a week of trying to make the app work and just writing this today, the App suddenly works! Loved the app. until it stopped working on my Samsung S10+.

Definitely recommend it!!",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"For me, it's the best calorie tracking app, plain and simple. One cool feature though would be the ability to compare foods & drinks so individuals can evaluate and hopefully make the healthier choice. I've been in places where I was stuck between two food items and having to go back and forth checking calories, fats, protein, etc. It would be cool to just have that comparing feature. I'm not a tech or app development guy but it would be cool to see that in the near future.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,I really like the feedback I get. it tells me what my weight will be in a month if I continue eating like I did that day. Sometimes it's really great and sometimes it's really bad. But it gives me something to think about. And it's pretty easy to use. It has most chain restaurants built in. It even will scan barcodes! The newest version is much faster on scanning barcodes.,5.0
Felicity Galea,Functional,"I love this app. I have been using just the free version for several years. It is a great aide for mindful nutrition, weight management, and identifying food allergies. The barcode scanner makes tracking foods easy. It tracks nutrients, and pops up alerts if you are getting near or go over your goal limit. I can see if I need more of something like iron, and there is a pie chart showing percentages of protein, fats, and carbohydrates, making it easy to see what needs to be adjusted.",5.0
Brandon Pitman,Functional,"I'm strictly counting calories to lose weight (goal is to lose 30lbs, currently down 17lbs). This app provides the ease of scanning bar codes so that you don't have to manually enter all the information and offers the ability to enter exercises for burned calories, which is really convenient and easy to understand! Depending on how everything goes with weight loss, I may decide to purchase the full app capabilities. Overall, if you are focused on calorie counting, this is a great app!",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"The free version is actually really powerful for tracking your meals. There are a ton of foods already in the database. The ability to add stand alone nutrition information is limited to only calories, with the ability to add stands alone macros behind a paid subscription. Reminders make sure you stay up to date with your meal tracking. Highly recommended if you are trying to hit a weight loss goal.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great program for tracking diet habits and nutrition. Automatically lets you know when you've hit goals for specific nutrients based on weight and diet targets, and reminds you to log meals(you can turn this function off if it bothers you which is nice). Needs improvement for the exercise side of the app, in that it's missing a number of common exercises thaat should definitely be there(no burpees)in its database, and offers no way to add your own. Overall excellent quality, intuitive and extremely useful but could be even better with just a couple little touches.",5.0
Rachel Bailey,Functional,"Sometimes it really isn't the app. I was having issues with saving recipes, even after installing and reinstalling it. I was sure the app was the issue. Then my phone stopped sending and receiving photo messages. Then it couldn't text or call at all. I talked to tech support for a week before I finally upgraded to a new phone. I had an S9 Plus that I was reluctant to give up, but now I have a Motorola Stylus and suddenly the app works flawlessly again. I'm relieved and so happy with it.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I like it very much. I would like to be able to edit a name of an item i.e. from frozen spinach to spinach, frozen.

A Google user,Functional,"Have used it for years. Great app. Food data base is very large, which I appreciate. It still doesn't have small local restaurants in it, so I must find the best match, or enter appropriate recipes or ingredients. Still and all, I've lost about 50 pounds and kept it off for years. Maintenance is very challenging. I keep exercising and tracking calories, but weight creeps up! Vigilance is key! ðŸ˜Š",5.0
Brian Feldman,Functional,"Virtually everything I eat is already available by quick bar code scan. If not, it'll be there by search. Once the app learns your preferences it's super fast and easy. Keeps track of macros, vitamins, and exercise too (will link to your other apps so you don't have to even enter it). Perfect for helping you keep accurate track what you eat so you have a real chance of eating right.",5.0
Sister Elizee,Functional,"(FREE VERSION USER). Great app. Even the free version is very helpful. I can keep my progress on track because I can track my eating and exercise activities on this app. It calculates estimated future results. I'll keep the free version for six months. If I'm still using it daily, I'll get the annual package. I wish that it had a built-in calculator with the four base functions for manual entry. For now, I'm switching between this app and my calculator app to get the off measurements just right.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've only used the free version (considering upgrading to Premium though, just cause I'm working on a weight gain goal and think it might be more helpful), and it's a great app to track your food intake. That's about all I've used it for; I haven't dug into the other features. Tons of foods in the db but you need to double check after you scan barcodes (my preferred input method) because the stored food may not be correct, though it usually is.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Very easy to use taking little time and very helpful intracking food intake, exercise, water consumption, etc. It scans labels to automatically giving details like calories per serving, serving size and more. It can even go into greater details in nutrion tracking which I do not use at this time, pehaps when I get closer to my goal weight. ( I have a significant amount to lose). This app is making success a certainty for me. A must try app for anyone who is ready to lose. Love it!",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love this app. I have used it on and off for about 5 years, and it never fails. I do not have the premium version, but the regular version lets you track macros, scan food, create your own custom meals, track your weight, and set goals. The graphs that demonstrate your weight loss are fun to look at too. I downloaded the Lose It app and while it is prettier, it would not let me log my meals for the next day on the free version which is CRAZY. MFP gives you everything you need.",5.0
Brandy Newlun,Functional,I haven't subscribed to the premium version of the app...yet. Its been great so far. I do wish the free version would sync my fitbit daily steps. I guess if I get the premium version it will be for that purpose only. Otherwise the lite version is awesome and is easy to use. My fav parts are the barcode scanner and the recipe finder for easy nutritional information.,5.0
Evan Wallace,Functional,"As other people have mentioned the most recent updates have messed up the step syncing with Fitbit app. It varies every day whether or not I will get all of my steps added in. It worked most of the day today until just before I posted this comment. No matter how many times you try to reconnect, uninstall/reinstall, or restart your phone it doesn't fix the issue. I love this app and hope that they will work out these bugs soon. Edit - Bugs have been fixed!",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really like using the (free version) of the app. I'm using it to count calories and log exercise. It's simple and it also gives some advice and guidance on nutrition as you go. Sometimes, if i make something at home, I'll find the next closest version of that food (from a restaurant or something) and use that instead of trying to custom enter the home recipe.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great for tracking your food intake. You're able to scan foods with a bar code to quickly add it to your diary, if it is in the database. I would say 90-95% of what you scan will be recognized. Just be sure to input the right amount of servings. There's also a section for progress for weight loss. The free app allows you to focus on calories but macros are displayed. For more customization, you have to buy the app, but i haven't felt the need to yet. recommended app!",5.0
Ed Delgado,Functional,"Hand down one of my favorite calorie/macro tracking apps. I did pay for the full ad free version. The extra features are great. It's kept me honest about how I'm eating. It's given me the ability to balance my diet to my specific needs. The bar code scanner makes tracking easy. One complaint, some items aren't able to be measured using standardized measurements. I would prefer to use unit of weight (grams,ml etc). Some items are measured by tablespoon or teaspoon which has me googling.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love this app, and it's really helped me track what I eat and lose weight. It's super helpful that you can customize your own calorie and nutritional goals, and integrate your exercise and lots of other apps and devices you might be using (like fitbit). Also the ""scan your food"" option makes tracking calories and nutritional information super easy. My only complaint is that the app is occasionally a little glitchy, but it typically fixes itself if I close and re-open it.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,I was looking for an app that would help me track food intake and weight loss at the same time. This app helps me hold myself accountable for what i eat and makes it really easy to save meals and recipe i use often. I would have liked to go with the pro version for some of the added features like saving recipes and additional nutrition info but i don't want to be suckered into another subscription. I wish there were different Tiers maybe. Otherwise love the Free version.,5.0
Hannah Clay-barber,Functional,"I've been using this for one week and I love it. It doesn't just keep track of calories, but the nutrients you eat. My favorite feature is at the end of the day, they estimate how much you could weigh based off your net calories. I find that calculation keeps me accountable and motivated so I don't skip tracking meals and I move my body/workout more. Easy to use, full of helpful information, and minimal advertising for the free version. Very good app.",5.0
Jessica Lynne,Functional,"Everything I need in an app. I maxed out on characters trying to explain all of the features it has. Things I wouldn't have even thought to track along with in-app information on a massive variety of work outs, recipes, calorie count. Even a barcode scanner for ease. The app has neve crashed on me, it's easy to navigate, and I'm constantly impressed with the variety of helpful options. This app was recommended to me, and I sure bring it up to others.",5.0
Robert Mihara,Functional,"I've used this app for over 1000 days and find it relatively easy to use. I track 3 meals and 3 snacks a day on my smart phone. The data transferred quickly to my laptop for a more detailed look. I wish the database had more dishes from local restaurants. I seem to order meals where I have no detailed knowledge of the ingredients. This shortfall makes accurate tracking hard. However, I have learned to live with this.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love it and am considering the premium. I know some have stated they can not change the serving but I have no problem changing the serving to .5 or .75 or whatever percent of the serving size I am eating, perhaps it is how it is being entered but no problem here. The premium service will cost $9.99 a month or $49.99 a year and I would say the year is the better cost option if upgrading to premium. I believe they will give you 30 day free trial of premium to try it. If it were $5 month I would probably try it and if I liked it switch to yearly but $10 month equates to $120 yearly and I can not justify it when so many apps cost less. I feel the free app is great, of course nothing is really free and the cost to us is seeing the pop up ads but still worth a free app that works the way I want it to.",5.0
Cheryl Nielsen,Functional,"Although the premium is nice I do not need it, the free version does enough for me. It is easy to use. I did have an issue when I tried to cancel my free trial, a glitch made it loop back to the playstore to install the app again and would not let me cancel before they charged me. However, almost immediately after I sent the complaint, I got a reply that it had been cancelled and I would receive the refund for the subscription so I feel they are very customer service oriented.",5.0
Ryan Harp,Functional,"Love this app, been using it for years now. My only gripe isn't really a gripe but a suggestion and a feature I'd really like to have. Dark mode. I have really bad eyes and seeing they screen so white and bright makes it hard to read what I'm doing. It's a simple feature to add. Other than that this app is awesome. It can sync with Samsung Health making it easy to just scan a barcode and have it sync.",5.0
Elizabeth Judge,Functional,"Very useful! I have never counted calories before so took some getting used to. The foods I searched were almost always already in their catalog list which is a tremendous time saver. The ads certainly get in the way but are taylored to me so not quite as annoying. I may just bite the bullet and pay for a year. It's a reasonable fee. Good app! I never wanted to wear a fitness tracker before but now I am into the ""game"" of tracking my steps, etc all day long to upload into the Exercise portion.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Love all of the features that come with the free app. I was able to drop over 20 lbs and get back to where I feel comfortable. Being able to scan foods, save recipes and meals helped me to make smart calorie choices. Being able to log my exercise made it easy to treat myself when I wanted to (extra 30 minutes of rowing = bowl of ice cream). I've maintained for a year and a half now. If you need help with your health and fitness goals this is a great tool!",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love this app. It helps me not overeat. I've maybe lost a few pounds in over a week of using it. I like the challenges since they help motivate me. Some things I wish it did different are the following. Show that I've completed a diary. Whenever I click the complete button, I can always click it again. Id like the app to tell me that I've already clicked it. I also would like the log food reminders to be turned off after you have logged meals. Finally, I wish there was more exercise options.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"edit- Bar code scanner is working again. Still love this app. Handy app for tracking basic nutrition. The last update caused the bar code reader to make the app stall and freeze. I had to delete and reinstall to get it to work again. Other than that I love this app. If the developers can get the code scanner working right again, I'll come back and give it 5 stars.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app is easy to use and has a huge database of food, which makes finding foid items quick and simple. I've had brief issues with logging in and/or nor being able to reach the server, but it's resolved quickly. The one time I did contact support, they were responsive and made sure the issue was fixed. I'd definitely recommend this app for dietary tracking. You can track caloric intake and you can track exercise and water consumption. For a free app it's quite comprehensive.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app has been amazing for counting calories for me! It's really intuitive and easy to use. I love being able to scan barcodes and search for basically anything. It's really easy to create new entries and add my own recipes too. I like the goals it sets and I love that it calculates my projected weight in five weeks based on what I eat each day. I haven't had luck linking it to map my walk (probably user error), but I haven't really minded because they both work well on their own.",5.0
Shannon O'Brien,Functional,"I've used both the app and the browser version. They have different strengths. I like being able to scan bar codes with my phone or add to my diary when I'm not using my laptop. I find the interface intuitive and easy to read. I also like the integration with Fitbit in general. Edit: At the moment I'm using the app primarily to track my protein, fiber, and salt intake. I have lost weight with the app, but it's good for various nutritional needs",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Generally speaking I like the app. It seems to do a good job of finding the various foods I eat each day, and helping me track calories, etc. One complaint. When I first installed this app and the My walk app, they synced, and the walking app would move the burned calories into this app. It stopped doing that a few weeks ago. I re-installed both apps, but still no syncing. Not sure how to fix this.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Tracking calories is a smart way to weight loss and eating well! I have lost 15 pounds since I began tracking my meals on this app! It is easy to use and the ability to scan the barcodes of the foods I have consumed makes tracking calories convenient. It is difficult to track the calories of my homemade meals, therefore I frequently am estimating calories for them. Overall, I highly recommend this app for weight loss and good health.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've used this free app many times(without purchasing anything extra) over the years and it's always helped me get closer to my weight goals. There's a community of people and alot of extra help and motivators that come along with this app too. It has just about any restaraunt menu or grocery item you'd think of, so that's always nice. You don't have to figure out calories or nutrition info, it's just there! I've recommended it multiple times and my friends/family have also had success and enjoyed it. Definitely would recommend to people who are starting a diet and need a push or accountability and need help keeping track of their intake. Anyone really. It's a great application.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Had app for 2 weeks, which is usualky OK time to get used to a new app. Had this one figured out after a few days and it seems to cover all the bases for weight loss very well. On topnof that, it seems to integrate with other apps like it claims. That should all be expected performance, but in the swamp of apps that never do what they say, its an absolute pleasure to find one that dies what it says and does it well.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Very user friendly. The barcode function makes it super easy to add food and beverages, but you can search for them as well. The ability to view my progress as a graph lets me visualize how I'm doing over time instead of just looking at overall results. I also love that it syncs with my smart watch's app to add my activities for the day.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great app for calorie counting! I LOVE the barcode scanner feature, and I really like how it gives me nutritional information about the food beyond just the calories. I also like the ability to track my progress. It's simple and easy to use, and even though some features require a premium subscription, the free version is still awesome. Love it!",5.0
Cathy Weller,Functional,"Simple to use, seems very accurate on food & nutrition information and has the best range of food options for tracking, as compared to 3 other very popular diet/food tracking apps I've used. (Both free & paid subscription). Only complaint, unless I'm missing something, is the limited options for choices of exercise if you aren't syncing with a step/activity/ exercise tracking device.",5.0
Kim Buchheid,Functional,"This is a great app for tracking food with very little effort. The only thing that needs some improvement is how exercise factors in. When I do a long run outside in the summer, I need more sodium to keep my electrolytes in balance, but the app doesn't take this into account. I've also found that if I eat the extra calories the app gives me for steps I gain weight instead of losing weight, so it appears the number of calories for steps is overstated. Bottom line it's a great app!",5.0
LaChilena09,Functional,"Love it! Helps me to stay on track and be more mindful. I've had for at least a decade and it saves everything so when I take a break and then come back, it still has it all. Helps when eating out or processed foods and it has the most foods from restaurants and easy to substitute or get as close as possible. Can scan barcodes and that makes it very convenient.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app is wonderful! It was recommended by nutritionists at the Veterans hospital. It's easy to use, includes an incredible amount of foods and I love the bar code scanner. It can be customized for calorie intake, micro nutrients and much more. It has exercise and water logs. It's very motivational to see your expected weight if you keep going with your plan. The accountability of the app has helped me to lose almost 50 lbs!! My only suggestion is having a sleep log.",5.0
Kenlee Etienne,Functional,"Have used free version for a few years. Barcode scanner is such a nice function - or was. This should remain free. It's like buying a car these days then you're told, ""Oh, you want electric windows? That'll be extra."" Come on, this is a pretty standard feature. By the way, the exercise calories do not work correctly. In the past week, every time I access, same entry gets added again, gain, and again. In 5 weeks, I should weigh 48 lbs. based on completion. Why would I pay for this?",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really like myfitnesspal. I haven't used another food tracker, but I haven't felt the need to, nearly everything I'm looking for in a tracker is here. My one gripe, which I expressed to them, is, I'd like to see a diary calorie count feature that accommodates the every-other-day style of intermittent fasting. If they incorporated that it'd be truly perfect. It's not enough of a gripe to lose a star though; it's still a 5 star app.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,I love this app! It's great for portion control and eating the right amount without all the guess work. It's tells you when you've gone over in certain areas so you can adjust if needed. I love that it saves recipes and meals you've made making it easy to go back to and add. Within the first 2 weeks I lost 2 lbs! They couldn't have made it any simpler!,5.0
A Google user,Functional,Love this app. You can enter custom meals you make or just scan stuff you buy an add that way. For free version it does alot. It's great. Counts macros which is huge plus for me. Can also link step tracker and other apps to it. Have no issues with crashing at all. Ads are in it from time to time but it's not an absurd amount and you can exit right away without watching,5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Only been using for 2 weeks, but the application is great for daily journal. Database of foods is incredible. Nothing I haven't been able to find. Highly recommended as a nutrition tracker. Some foods have incomplete information so can sometime be difficult to search. Would like a way to vote up or down food items. That way you wouldn't have to sift through entries that aren't as complete as others.",5.0
Penny Hout,Functional,"I would give it more stars but I keep having to disconnect my Fitbit and reconnect to get it to sync with my fitness pal. Very annoying! I've contacted support and they haven't responded, annoying also. Fairy easy to use and figure out, except for the problem with syncing my steps I like the app. Update they have fixed the issues and the app has been working good. It's a great app to keep track of what u eat and your steps.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,I used this app in the past when the barcode scanning first became available. It took forever to upload and most products wouldn't come up. I decided to try it again and am very impressed with all improvements and add on's that are available. I am still learning all the new things that are available but I have to say so far the nutrition tab is my favorite. It is very easy to see what meals you have logged are the healthiest and where you are daily on important things like sodium and sugar.,5.0
Alex Renee,Functional,I would like to update my review. Within a week the below issue has been resolved. FIVE STARS. I seriously love this app and the premium version. I love being able to track macros. Many restaurants food are available within the app to track making the planning of your meals easy! I love tracking my food on this app; however it is frustrating it's not syncing correctly with my Samsung health. No matter how many times I disconnect and uninstall the app.,5.0
Ashley Dymock,Functional,"Every time I feel like I'm starting to eat too much, this is a great tool to reign me back in and retrain my appetite! I love that I can scan barcodes (and the barcode scanner has gotten MUCH better since the last time I used the app) and get all the nutritional info. I also appreciate that I can create my own meals, foods, recipes, workouts, and more. Plus, you can import recipes from other websites! Counting calories can be time consuming but MyFitnessPal makes it convenient and easy.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love this app! Super easy to use and like the ability to look up the calories before I eat something. The scanning option is very convenient as well. Down side..so many ads! Not sure if you go to premium if this will eliminate the ads? Last note: I have not had any of the issues that I saw in the other reviews. I do have unlimited data so I have not checked data usage however, responds quickly, no problem creating my own recipes. I like the reminders to log meals.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,Upgraded to My Fitness Pal Premium to let the app do the work of computing the macros. It's been awesome. Not only in tracking but giving you all the data needed to make appropriate nutritional decisions instantly with just a few clicks. Have not had any problems and the learning curve is simply intuitive. Try it free for 30 days!,5.0
Movin' It with Mel,Functional,"Super easy - way better than pen and paper (yes, I did that for about a year)! I especially like that it figures my exercise into the calories I have left to consume so it both encourages me to work out more and gives me the opportunity to eat more based on the extra calories I burn. I love it. I'm currently using the free version, but now that I've had some time to learn the system, I'm considering paying for the premium version. Thanks, Carlleen (ckbmovesmore), for the recommendation!",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Counting calories has always been very daunting for me. In fact, studies have shown that it CAN do more harm than good. But with the barcode scanner, and the ""recent foods"" list, it's SO EASY! I'm on a very strict, low calorie diet right now, but I wanted to make sure I was still getting all of the proper nutrients my body needs, and be able to see exactly where I'm falling short so that I can supplement appropriately. This app has really helped me to do that!",5.0
Emily Evangelista,Functional,"Great app to keep track of calories, proteins, fats, sugars, carbs, vitamins, & more! Easy to use! Once you add in food, it saves into your Food History & you can click the same food item each time you eat it. If the barcode pulls up the food, but the numbers do not quite match the actual product you have in your hand, then you can click ""find a better match"" button at the bottom to find the right one or click the ""create a food"" button, which you can then type everything from the label!",5.0
Holly Bentley,Functional,If you're looking for a convenient way to count calories this app does that and then some. Another calorie counting app I've tried kept many items locked and wouldn't log them or show their data unless you used the paid version. This app does have a paid version but it appears to offer a ton more options and the calorie counting feature is not throttled at all in the free version.,5.0
Jen Van Horn,Functional,"Easy to navigate and understand- best feature: scan the pckg of food all info comes up for a serving size and you edit from there. Not at all glitchy, ads do not bother me or get in my way. I find this very helpful, I'm just using the free version and am glad that I decided to use this to track what I was eating. Whether you're using it for weight gain, loss, or just to see where you can tweak your diet it's a great tool.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I'm pretty new to using this app but it's very useful - essential, even - in helping me count calories. There's a huge amount of nutritional information already logged, so I don't have to enter everything myself... You can also adjust the portion size to reflect what you actually had, which is very useful. I didn't know that at first and made new entries for smaller portions. You don't have to do that. Oops.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Finally putting my health first, the first thing I did was download the app. It's simple and easy, and I've recommended this app to strangers as well. The only downside is, sometimes the app doesn't have basic workouts, like the elliptical; so a had to put an alternative workouts in. Plus, if I am doing a work out that is designated towards the number of sets vs the minutes, it makes it very hard to track how much calories I've lost. Otherwise, love this app and keep up the great work! :)",5.0
Markus,Functional,"Using this APP is way better than the old way of writing food and calories down. The free version has all the features needed to lose weight, I lost 13 pounds in 4 weeks using it. It helps you decide what foods to eat that you like and helps analyze and guide your choices. The ads in the home feed can get annoying and some are inappropriate, like dating apps etc that I have no history of visiting but I guess that is part of it being free.",5.0
Ryan Casino,Functional,Haven't been able to use the app to its fullest being that some of its best features are locked behind the premium version. The free app however is still a great tool to help keep track of your food and nutrition. I love the fact you can follow friends who have also downloaded My Fitness Pal so it feels like you're not going through a new health journey alone. Excited to make use of the other features that I haven't touched yet. Overall great and convenient app.,5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've been using this app for about 2 weeks. It has helped me to change my eating habits and lifestyle. The food diary of excellent, you can input whatever you eat by scanning the UPC (which is incorrect less than 8% of the time) or manually. just being able to see what I eat and the calories that I was consuming has helped. I particularly like the daily recipes that come up on your homescreen along with the fitness blog that is included. I wish they included workout/fitness routines",5.0
Nicole â€œMarcellaâ€,Functional,"Great app! The free version helped me to lose about 30 lbs in 6 months. It also helped me to realize I needed more protein. My only problem is the exstimate of maximum calories it sets for me only works in winter. In the summer, even with regular outdoor walking (which I can't do in winter), I have to consume 120 fewer calories than the app's limit to maintain my weight. I would like it if this app considered the fact that people burn calories differently depending upon the season. Thanks!",5.0
Brandon Brackett,Functional,I haven't used others so this is based off does it help...yes. I've lost over 90lbs. Because I'm tracking calories and carbs and protein intake and going to the gym. Some times I wonder if the numbers are a bit off but this has helped me emensly in keeping track and losing weight I use the free version and I like it. Worth it. Don't get inundated with ads there all in the form of a news feed with those af articles and the very occasional once in 2 to 3 days pop up that clears in 5 seconds.,5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Almost every food is listed, and you can create recipes, make meals, etc. Pretty great. It can sync with Google fit as well as a lot of wearable devices (but you can also log your activities manually). Free version doesn't harass users to upgrade or watch an ad before logging things. Only experienced a couple of bugs in my about 1 1/2 years of use.",5.0
W Jeff,Functional,"I have been using it for a few years now. It's a great program that works for every goal I have had, whether to lose weight, run longer, or maintain my weight. The feature to adjust the caloric intake and percentages has been incredibly helpful. The option to input my own recipes is easier than it was before. I have not experienced any glitches with the program.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great app. Everything that you need is free, the premium stuff is just extra. This app has helped me to lose weight, and stay healthy and accountable. It also helps to plan out my meals ahead of time. One minor problem- I believe that the users are the people who add the food nutritional profiles. Just check for accuracy when you are adding a new food, because sometimes it is wrong. Overall would recommend.",5.0
Zach Speck,Functional,"Excellent app. I highly recommend it. I love that I can scan barcodes for nutrition information, but I can also calculate it all manually and input it myself. I highly recommend this app to anyone - from athletes, to casual calorie counters, to people just trying to lose weight. It's very user friendly and an excellent way to track what you take in to your body. Best of all, the free version actually WORKS!",5.0
Catherine Hudson,Functional,I'm so totally new to weight loss because I've always been thin. This app is so simple that a small child could navigate it. I have learned so much from just using it in a short time. It has the really cool scanner that has recognized the barcode of everything I have put it on even store brand and locally made brands. The database is HUGE! It also allows me to put in my own homemade meals and subtracts the calories and puts the nutrients in the proper categories. I've lost 7 lbs so far! Love it,5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Using this to track calories and food but it links with my garmin to adjust for calorie burn, steps, and workouts. The notifications are not annoying. Used it for 3 weeks now and haven't got bored. I'm sure you can do more with it but I'm just using its basic functions. I have yet to scan a barcode it doesn't recognize and I have scanned some unusual organic or speciality items. Bottom line- This is a good app to track calories",5.0
Julian Martinez,Functional,"Makes watching my food so much easier. Whenever I have a food I haven't eaten before, if I scan the barcode it will stay in my list and if I have it again I can choose it from the list instead of rescanning it every time. Has all the nutritional values on display. You can set personal goals for macros consumed. This will show you where you're at each day (provided you track your foods with the app) this is all in the free version too! Great addition to your health equipment. Recommend for sure!!",5.0
Gregory Wright,Functional,"It can keep track of all calories, in (assuming you enter them) and out (assume you enter them). One great ""plus"" - I used a different app in the past, but this one has a bigger database of foods w/ product codes (to which you can add), and it doesn't automatically slap on the current time. Of course improvements could be made, but that's true of anything. Send the word, and update is their tool.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Pretty legit way to keep track of nutrient intake. Personally I'm trying to gain weight, and it helps make sure I am eating enough, on a continuous basis. Also, at the same time it is giving reminders about certain deficits of important nutrients (protein) or warnings about specific surpluses at unhealthy levels (sodium, fats) Cant speak to the premium version, as I haven't tried it yet.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Outstanding app. Really helping me to stay on track with weight loss and fitness goals. So simple to use yet so very helpful in balancing energy in vs energy out. The huge food database keeps amazing us with many restaurant menu items easily accessible. This app is a definite keeper for years to come. Love that other fitness apps feed into it, populating the appropriate fields for clear tracking.",5.0
Chris Roop,Functional,"Keeping a food log is the best way to impact your eating behavior. I've done it manually but it isn't sustainable. Good data comes from consistent input. The app not only makes it possible, it reminds you when you forget or get busy. The more I use it the more ways I find to make it easier.

A Google user,Functional,"Most important for me in a fitness/weight loss app is ease of use, because if it's too complicated, I know I'm going to give up on it. I love that it allows you to build a recipe of your own for a complete meal that serves 8, and then allows you to choose just one serving for yourself. The only thing that bugs me is that I've synched the fitness tracker thing that came preloaded on my phone, but for some reason, it doesn't transfer my steps. That's an really minor issue, though.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"* Makes meal, calorie and macronutrient tracking a breeze. * I especially love that I can save a meal when I put one together that really helps me meet my goals. * I haven't yet encountered a food that wasn't found in the lookup interface; and even when my search term doesn't yield an immediate result, the built in barcode scanner works perfectly. * Interface is smooth, haven't had any technical issues at all.",5.0
William Berry,Functional,"So far, so good. I use it for the calorie tracking. Which has been the most helpful to me. The other aspects are ok. It's social aspects are also lacking, but I'm actually fine with that. As the calorie tracking is my primary use. Adding ones exercises is lacking, as I use machines only at my gym and this app doesn't support enough machine options for me. So yeah, great calorie tracking, only ok on everything else. Still love it.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Free version is still pretty much feature complete. Very extensive index of foods. Scanning is easy. If you're tracking macros this should be your default tool. If you're making food yourself you can save recipes. If you're eating out at local places it's definitely harder to track, but you can make custom foods with estimates if you need to.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I used this app several years ago and tried to use a few others before coming back to this one. Compared to other apps, this one shows a lot more nutritional data for free, which I love! It is very easy to log what I eat and see how I can change my diet to meet my personal eating goals. I had initially switched apps because I wanted something more nutrition focused, rather than calorie focused, but this has ended up being the best of both.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Very happy with app. It has been beneficial in helping me understand the delicate balance between calories and exercise. Reviewing nutrition data helped me to adjust food portions and seasonings. Not always a simple task to find exact food portions. I occasionally have to research online. Overall, it is much better than one other app I tried.",5.0
Kelly Bradley,Functional,"Great app, I only have the free version because I just can't afford to pay for it monthly. However, if I did, I definitely would, as all the paid features look great. This app allows me to take control of my calorie intake and even plan meals. Even better, I can plan treats. With working off calories, I can allow myself more! Here's to maybe being a little slimmer soon ðŸ¤ž",5.0
Jackline Mwanza,Functional,Great for tracking calories precisely. Has a large database of food but what stands out most for me is the inclusion of indeginous foods and some are even verified.

Bobbie Woodard,Functional,"Updating my review. I've held off updating the app, because the interphase seems to get worse with each new update. And sure enough, the new app update is terrible! You can't fine tune it to your own liking. You have to use the presets! The graphics looks like they were designed by an 8th grader! And you can't go from day to day while inside an excersice or heart rate screen like you used to! And where is the battery level? If there was a way to go back to the original app, I absolutely would!",1.0
Amanda Richard,Functional,"I don't know what this update was meant to accomplish, but I've had nothing but problems with it. There were already connectivity issues, but they are much worse now.

It is a terrible app. Fitbit, you can do better.",1.0
Ken Cooper,Functional,"Since the redesign, it is very difficult to know the battery percentage on a Charge5 as it was removed from the pull down sync. It is too small to see without magnification on the watch face and only shows high, medium, or low on the device settings page. When an exercise is auto-detected, the type of activity is usually wrong and cannot be corrected. The new UI is very bright and has no dark mode option. Sleep tracking doesn't even account for time changes. Did anyone this test before release?",1.0
Kimberly D,Functional,"Update, further downgrading my review. Not a fan of the new interface. Been using Fitbit for years, but this new interface makes me think about switching. Colors are dull. And this may be a little thing, but you used to be able to find and compare similar exercises (like outdoor walks and hikes) much easier than now. It's a real pain now to try to compare. Exercise tracking is less accurate. The heart rate zone tracking is worse & everything that was useful is painful now.",1.0
Barry Hawker,Functional,"Nothing seems to work the way it's supposed to. The latest update is garbage. I've been using Fitbit for many years now.

Jess Weigensberg,Functional,"Update: canceled premium and will be moving to apple products. Since the most recent update I have had multiple daily sync disruptions. Having to turn my watch and Bluetooth off to reconnect multiple times a day. It is becoming very inconvenient. The UI update is also pretty bad. It's difficult to navigate and read.

Liane Pollard,Functional,"Good lord, the newly revamped Google version of the Fitbit app sucks. It's ugly, it's lost functionality, it's not as customizable, and it's ugly. Thanks, I hate it. Huge fail. But wait, there's more! When you drill down into the app, for example under the 'Learn More' feature, you see the old Fitbit UI, colors and all. So Google was too lazy to revamp the whole thing, they just slapped a facade onto it. It's laughable. Bring back the old app.",1.0
Melissa Herron,Functional,"Hate, hate, hate the update. Nothing but synching and connectivity problems since the switch. I need to completely power down my Fitbit and reboot, sometimes twice daily, to get it to synch. Yes, I've tried the trouble shooting tips.

Elaine Mitra,Functional,"The app no longer works since the update. My app has been refusing to sync properly no matter what troubleshooting I do.

Josie Shaheen,Functional,"I hate the new update 28 Sep 23. There's got to be some way that the app can actually filter and compare exercises from day to day. I use to be able to at least some trends when I run.

I can no longer edit activities in the app. Everything I use to use it for is essentially gone.",1.0
Aspen Johnson,Functional,"A couple of weeks ago, my versa 2 stopped tracking heart rate and sleep. I've tried all the steps I can find online, including a factory reset, with no improvement. Just came to see if the app needed an update and saw the last update was completed 10/17... checked my app info, and the 16th is the last time either of these were tracked. This can not be a coincidence. The new app layout was also a fairly large redesign that's left us with an unattractive, all white, clunky UI.",1.0
Lau Ren,Functional,"The new color scheme is too monochrome, and not engaging at all. It's the opposite of what I want in a fitness app. Some of the basic functionality that used to work no longer works and lost usability. I can no longer change the workout type for fitbit detected activities. For example, I want to switch generic Aerobic to Martial Arts. It no longer allows that. On the other hand if I manually log martial arts, I can't see the related diagrams for heart rate zones etc. Terrible update.",1.0
Linda Heineman,Functional,"The app no longer updates my sleep, health or stress management activities. The changes to this app are horrible. It's no longer user friendly.

I find every part of these changes difficult. Please return the old version.",1.0
Erica JM,Functional,"The latest update is awful. The design is lacking and borderline confusing. But the worst this is, the fit it doesn't even sync anymore. Uninstalled, reset, you name it, I tried.

Alan Karp,Functional,"1. It was easy to record weight until the last update. One now has to hunt for it below automatically tracked items as we no longer have the ability to move weight to the top. .. 2. The app still lacks ability to record notes like blood pressure. .. After spending for the Fitbit device, the ""Premium"" subscription, which is pretty basic, seems excessive.",1.0
Aubrey Gonzalez,Functional,"Previously I would have given the app 5 stars but not after the update. As other users have indicated, you are not able to see as many metrics up at the top as before which is frustrating. However, the biggest issue for me is how monotone and ugly the whole thing is. For people like me that prefer eating to exercise, the motivators like color-coded metrics and fireworks that go off when you accomplish something make a difference. It may be dumb but it's true. Please please please change it back.",1.0
Brenda Gonzalez,Functional,I hate the inaccuracies of the GPS . Never shows the full route. Heart rate zones are harder to see. Update. I got a response from the company. I use the same route and it keeps getting worse. Even after the last update. Hard to connect to the GPS. Also I would like to see the activity zones better. Having them in different colors helps to do a quick assessment. I mean this is not a free application.,1.0
Elizabeth Bouwhuis,Functional,"I have bought every fitbit as the new ones come out. Everyone I get, is worse then the one prior. So incredibly disappointing.

I have done all the troubleshooting, several times since I've bought it back in December and it still doesn't work!!!!!",1.0
Deborah Williams,Functional,Very upset. Been using Fitbit for years. Now with updates it never connect to my phone. It keeps telling me to try again. It actually will make the steps from the day disappear. Keep trying to connect and does not want to connect. Very disappointed. If problem not fixed will have to look for a new option. Even my daughter has a Fitbit and it does not want to connect to hers either. Something that was working so well now doesn't work,1.0
Jessica Cohen,Functional,"I've had nothing but problems since this ""new and improved"" update. It never syncs unless you force stop the app or uninstall to reboot it. If I'm watching my steps up til midnight, at midnight the steps immediately drop by almost 1,000 and the miles/calories drop as well. Takes a lot of work to finally get it to reflect accurate reporting. Unacceptable for a Google app and a device advertised as being able to track your progress via the app. Will be switching to a new brand to avoid the hassle.",1.0
Angelene Baker,Functional,This app has had issues for weeks now. Since requiring that users share their location at all times. I have to turn my location sharing on just to sync my data and then turn off again directly after. I have no desire to have my location shared with Fitbit 24/7. And now the app is barely functioning. Used this app for almost 5 years now. Never had any issues. Now the app is utterly useless. Definitely time to switch over to an Apple watch!,1.0
Zoe Killing,Functional,It used to sync with my luxe no problem but since the update I'm constantly having to uninstall/install the app to get it to work. I truly hate the new interface. The older one was better. It was easier to use and the color scheme and overall look makes it feel like I'm using an app for the a 2 yr old and I'm 44. It just looks childish and the whole app really irritates me. I've been waiting to get premium bc I wanted to see how good this app was first. I WILL NOT be purchasing premium.,1.0
Kelsey Martinez,Functional,"What happened to this app?? They've removed a lot of the incentives (""competing"" with friends or completing challenges) and with the latest update, it won't even sync anymore. I've tried all the usual (& Fitbit support recommended) methods of getting it to sync which occasionally works for that one instance, but then it doesn't sync again unless I redo everything again. There shouldn't have to be this much effort to sync to the app. I'd be better off tallying my steps throughout the day.",1.0
James Tiernan,Functional,"The app used to be decent. Now it won't sync properly. When I click the help button it takes me to a uselessly generic page listing the things that ""could be"" but aren't wrong. I used to love this app. Also, I strongly dislike the last update. Very boring interface. What's next, 80's computer black background with green letters?",1.0
D Hazen,Functional,"Not a fan. Recent app updates are much less user friendly. More complicated to view exercise and zone minutes by week, look and feel of home screen is too tough to read because of the lack of color for separation and grouping, too much white space with no definition, etc. In prior version could easily click on a specific stat from home screen (e.g., zone minutes) and then use tabs to easily navigate from day to week to month. Please bring back something more like the prior version!",1.0
Matthew Clark,Functional,New update is garbage. Not intuitive at all. I find it only tracks 1 exercise per day. When I go for a run it will not calculate my entire distance. Most of my runs are missing 1 mile in the activity even though it shows an accurate lap count. Not sure why the update occurred but it is complete garbage. Having to scroll through multiple days to compare exercises Is not easy nor is it an upgrade from previous version. I am strongly considering tossing this in the garbage.,1.0
Gabbie K,Functional,"New update is so ugly! Stuff is harder to navigate and it displays less information by default. Wish we had the option to change it back. Moved all of my data that I was tracking daily to different, more inconvenient locations. Display is just boring. Recent update is buggy as heck.

Ginger Watson,Functional,"As an additional followup after your response-I had already read the article & my location services were previosly set at 'while in use' (for several years) & I was able to swipe sync prior to this update.

Please bring back the battery view in the app also. I will no longer be recommending fitbit to friends.",1.0
Bill Papariella,Functional,"The new User Interface / Design is disappointing. Bland. The Badge icons are boring.

When you click to upload a photo, it just flashes on the screen quickly and disappears.",1.0
Calicko,Functional,I do not care for the new update. I really hate this constant updating and changing. I understand some things need improvement but changing the entire app is not always the answer. Now multiple data views don't work properly. Seems harder to read and navigate with the more monotone look they now provide. Also have more issues with syncing since the update. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Update: Due to the most recent update the app does not show battery percentage anywhere.,1.0
Metal Chris,Functional,"On the latest update active zone minutes are displayed on the first screen only. They don't show up in the weekly screen. Even though I pass 22 active zone minutes per day, and it does show a breakdown of activities with active zone minutes, the app shows no exercise days. Only improvement is the sync is faster than it used to be. And still, all these years later, with many users asking for it - still no dark mode!!",1.0
Jean Vilmenay,Functional,The most recent version doesn't sync! Turns out the last update changed my permissions settings and didn't bother to let me know. It wasn't syncing because it no longer had permission. Seems like it would have been super helpful to let us know that you changed our permission settings with the update rather than leaving us to miss the app syncing our data until we figured this out!,1.0
Vadim Panfilov,Functional,"food tracking is a joke, almost impossible to use. food search produces too many results, no way to star enries to be able to find them later. previously tracked food goes to recent and frequent tabs. sort order and content in those tabs changes all the time, there is no way to search there, can't remove unwanted entries. items go missing. the only ""usable"" feature- barcode scanning, but it often returns wrong items or it does not recognize barcode at all so you have to try 3-4 times.",1.0
Jim Pott,Functional,"Not a good app. Just moved from Apple to Samsung phone and Fitbit. The Inspire 2 band is garbage for so many reasons, but wouldn't stop tracking for over 5 minutes because stopping the Inspire is a chore.

SUSAN BURLINGAME,Functional,"Horrible! Should have left well enough alone. The home page is a disaster. My profile picture is gone and no amount of reloads, reinstalling the app, restarting my phone has rectified the issue. I can't understand who at fitbit thought this was a good idea. Should have done a feasibility study with users before rolling it out. Huge thumbs down for me. I'm seriously considering buying a different tracker.",1.0
Brigette B.,Functional,"Since last update, keeps disconnecting from bluetooth. Have to remove my Versa 3 from the Fitbit app and repair. Every time my phone is far, itndisconnects without reconnecting unless I redo the above process. Sick of this. This issue also happened last year. Plus, the interface is awful and bland now. Google just ruins everything it touches. It did the same thing to Waze.",1.0
Bailey Gertsma,Functional,"I don't like the new design at all. Feels like they picked one color other than white and decided to keep labels small. Sure we get to pick the stats we want to seein an order, but I'm still scrolling 2 or 3 times to find the sleep Stat. I am having a lot of problems getting my watch to sync. I have also discovered the wifi search is forever stuck on loading and I can't find anything to connect to. How on earth did this get passed by your qa team? This is horrible.",1.0
Savanna McClain,Functional,Absolutely do not like the new update of the app. Ever since it updated I go to add my calories and it says I've already eaten the same exact amount of calories I've burned for the day. Something is definitely glitching with the app! I've tried restarting everything and nothing works. Super disappointing as I've had fitbit for over 6 years and recommend it to everyone! Unless they fix their issues I will not be recommending this to anyone anymore.,1.0
Lisa S,Functional,"Not syncing AGAIN! Hasn't since 10/22. GARBAGE! This is frustrating. I look at devices, it's there. BUT STILL WON'T SYNC! Very frustrating.

Drew Nelson,Functional,"GOOGLE IS SPYING ON US!! The new update will not allow you to sync the app until you give them permission to track your location even when the app is not running. So basically your phone is always transmitting your location 24/7. Not to mention what ever else they are now collecting. Just the battery usage alone is enough to say no thanks. Sending my Ionic back for the refund, and deleting the app. I think they made it look bad so you won't notice the major invasion of privacy.",1.0
Maureen Ahern,Functional,"HATE>>>HATE>>>HATE THIS UPDATE. It's not user-friendly. Getting to specific data is a pain. For example to get to time in sleep stages you have to scroll through the sleep app and then it has a stupid bar graph instead of just the amount of time/percentage in each stage. Also, it was difficult to figure out how to provide feedback on my phone. Whose idea was this?",1.0
Seth Fox,Functional,"Update: Customer support hasn't been helpful at all, but I found the source of the bug. If the enable the always on display the feature starts working.

Elisa Bonkowski,Functional,"The latest app update is terrible. Wasted screen space, drab colors, doesn't show battery % level for my Luxe anymore.

I did a complete reinstall of app ... it worked for a day. WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH YOUR UPDATE? Please fix the problem ASAP.",1.0
Sondy Garvey,Functional,"New app is much less useable than before and also just flat out broken. Calculates and displays the wrong pace, distance, calories info for my walk and won't accept my corrections. I did 2 walks but it only shows one and I can't fix it. What was the point of doing this change? I can't even track my exercise! The graphs only show stats within an hour range, not actual times as Ã¬t did a few releases ago. Fitbit not the prize it used to be. Bummer. Yes, I too am looking at iWatch now.",1.0
Nathan Tripp,Functional,"The app works great for the most part. The biggest issue that even though the app tracked my location perfectly when doing a walk (the route on the map is perfect).

Renee Kostner,Functional,"Held off reviewing hoping they'd realize how terrible this update is. Previous version was a lot better. Can no longer check battery level from app. New app wastes too much space on the home page so one can't see things easily at a glance. Can't customize as much. Can no longer see Friends as easily. Also, the app still can't handle daylight savings time--even after all these years the app still can't get sleep right. Please, please ditch this version. The old one was so much better!",1.0
Christine Lafler,Functional,"Used to be great. The Oct 2023 update ruined it. This is AWFUL. Now it's pale blue text on white, spread out so you have to scroll to find even the basics, the ""dashboard"" has only 3-4 layout options - all bad, and they removed the battery life percentage indicator from the top front to generic word descriptions 2-3 menus deep. Terrible design, many useful tools are gone, and those that remain have been changed to be less useful. How did this pass design and UX testing???",1.0
Conor,Functional,"This new interface is not working out (no pun intended) so well. Randomly the app will close while I'm trying to log my food or water intake and there's been quite a few times lately where I'm unable to manually sync my Fitbit with the app and have to wait 10 minutes or so before I can. Updates are suppose to increase efficiency and functionality, not decrease it. Please fix this",1.0
George Dennis,Functional,"This app will almost never sync - NEVER on the first attempt & usually not until the third, fourth, or fifth try if it syncs at all. When it has worked, I had to persistently try again & again & again (& again & again) before it worked - it took forever for the devices to communicate the data to each other, usually consuming as much as 5%+ of my phone's battery. I wish they had spent more time fixing this problem than coming out with new devices so they could continue to sell poor products.",1.0
lemongreen (lemongreen),Functional,"Edit: contacted support, all I got for my effort was that they were aware of the issue (that the app is throwing a connection problem for the gallery on my android phone) and were looking into it, and then CLOSED MY CASE!!

Angela Boncore,Functional,"Simply put, if it aint broken, DONT FIX IT. This redesigned app simply sucks. No longer easy to operate. My GPS isn't the same as before. Now everything you do ie exercise has to be done thru the watch itself making it more difficult to use and I'm not a tech savy person. I want the old settings back!! I have no intentions of purchasing a premium package ever. I don't need it. Extremely Disappointed in in the new fitbit updates.",1.0
Nancy Dolan,Functional,"Royally messed up since Google took over! ðŸ˜¢ Battery percentage is no longer available ( bring it back!). After almost a week of trying to sync and log in to the app, finally got in yesterday! Can't believe you took a program that was sleek and very well designed and turned it into something that looks like a high school student designed it after one coding class! Ever hear the saying ""if it's not broke, don't fix it""? Very poorly designed! Oh, yes...now my Fitbit's not recording steps!",1.0
Danielle Birch,Functional,"The latest update with the new interface is not user-friendly at all. You can't see battery percentage. Also, it seems that it no longer tracks multiple workouts?!? I've been using Fitbit for 7 years, and the app always worked perfectly. Why change something that isn't broken??? Read the other reviews; no one is happy with the update. The new design is very muted and requires more steps to view the dashboard. Fitbit, stop succumbing to the pressures to be ""innovative.""",1.0
sanda kaufman,Functional,"The new app version is visually unhelpful and functionally abysmal. There is no accounting for this move. Fitbit needs to go back to the previous version of the app. I've had fitbit for 9 years, but I am now considering a change because all that I find helpful is gone. Whoever had the idea should quickly find another job. Change for change sake is really bad. On top of terrible visuals, the app is broken. If you log water, it does not show correctly on the front page. Same for hourly steps.",1.0
Beth Ulrich,Functional,"The ""improved functionality"" really doesn't improve anything. Too much white and drab colors. Nothing is eye-catching. There used to be a heart rate fat-burning zone, and that is no longer. I can't edit my workouts, even if my watch/the app get the distance wrong (which has been almost daily for the past few months). Between the useless app and my watch that's been incorrect on heart rate, distance, and other things lately, I'll be looking elsewhere for a fitness watch this holiday season.",1.0
Sharli Grove,Functional,"I've been greatly disappointed with fitbit over the past year. Last winter, they discontinued the challenges. I actually found great motivation in those. The most recent update has been another 2 steps back. Not only is the home screen dull, but you can no longer customize the specifics of what you see. You have no choice in the order your items you track are listed in. I just bought my newest fitbit this summer, and I'm regretting it now. I'm ready to switch products. (Joined 2017)",1.0
DeShaun Craddock,Functional,"The most recent update has removed the battery info for some reason. Not only is it not readily available from the main screen, when you view your connected devices, the battery level there is inaccurate and reduced to full/medium/low values. I wanted to check the charging status from the app, and it said the device was fully charged. When I went to disconnect it, the device was only 78% charged. I'm cool with a cosmetic change but it's confusing that such a basic thing would be removed.",1.0
Esther G,Functional,"New layout is too big and clunky and not at all the way I desire to view the data. Somehow you all have gone backwards instead of forward. I actually don't use the app as much as I used to because it is so dang annoying and inconvenient to get the data I want. I will absolutely not be continuing on with Fitbit in the future and will be evaluating other fitness devices. After weeks on this layout, there is no getting used to it. It is a failure from both design and functionality.",1.0
Emelia Rose,Functional,"I really do not like the new update. It makes me unmotivated and doesn't display the information the way I had it before and the way I liked. Its more complicated to look at certain data which is extremely frustrating. Ever since the update, I've been looking for a new service to use because I absolutely dislike the upgrade. I wish Fitbit would go back to the way it was. This new format is boring, unmotivating, confusing and dumbed down. Fitbit please do better.",1.0
Beth S,Functional,"Won't sync. It's all but useless. I've completely lost interest in the app now that the challenges are gone. It used to keep me engaged and working on fitness with my friends.

Will probably be deleting the app soon, especially since it still doesn't sync normally (have to refresh numerous times after last fall's update).",1.0
William Roberts,Functional,"Doesn't work for me. Very difficult to use. Doesn't update properly. Have different totals on different screens. Totally unreliable.

Just woke up, and I have 5,954 steps on the new fitbit app. Must have been sleepwalking.",1.0
Sixx Gunz,Functional,"I received the VERSA 4 as a Father's Day gift. I loved all of the options on the interface. The new update with the focus on one specific thing is dumb.

Please change the layout back or redesign it again.",1.0
K Perreira,Functional,"Hate the update.....time to ditch the fitbit. I don't ask much from my fitness device, i just want to track activity and steps. The update has lost the function of being able to see individual activity. It only shows a line chart. There's a whole bunch of nonsense that I don't need a watch to track and decreased function in seeing the things I do.",1.0
paiz2kids paiz2kids,Functional,Google messed it up! Since the update my spO2 doesn't always sync. It'll show on my watch but it won't update in the app. You won't get to select which tiles you want. You have to select a special focus. And that just isn't ideal. Google is trying to out think us and it just doesn't work. I'm following up to the work around from Google/Fitbit. I've had to uninstall it and then reinstall it to get it to work. It worked for about a week and has stopped again.,1.0
Rick Riggi,Functional,"1 star for the newest update. All of my data is difficult to find, and even harder to interpret. I used to be able to look at my heart zones from workouts with ease, but the plots now make no sense as the colors for the different heart zones are nearly identical. Also, they took away the ability to see battery percentage in the app which is critical when charging your watch. It's almost as if they want you to destroy the battery by removing your device from its charger too soon.",1.0
I D,Functional,"It was a great app, and I rated it with 5. After the latest update, it É“ecome really, very bad with almost no face and a lot of bugs. After 2 min of use, for example, it crashes and returns the results to the latest sinc. I need to close it and start it again, and the cycle continues to the next crash in 2 min. The face does not show the results in a compact way like it was, but in a way that I can not find what I need. Please redesign the app if we can not return to the old version.",1.0
Vladik Nikolai,Functional,"I regret updating. The new layout and color scheme makes it un-navigatable. Serious accessibility issues. Icons being on the right and muted colors makes it unreadable at a glance. I can't customize the order of the data blocks, they're stuck in their weird categories so I have to hunt through everything now. It won't even tell me what battery percentage my device is at anymore. They tried to make it look more clean and simple but it resulted in a complicated mess for the end user",1.0
Jill,Functional,"I do *not* like this update. At all. I hate the new UI. Everything looks the same so there's hardly any way to tell the units apart when I'm scrolling so I have to really search for what I'm looking for. Waste of time. But most notable, it's not tracking sleep or exercise well anymore. It missed two normal exercise days this week since the update and didn't track a 2+ hour nap I wanted to look at.",1.0
vanessa hoffeditz,Functional,The upgrades to the Fitbit app are awful. The graphics are bland. It is hard to find the information you need. To find the calories burned from each category is difficult to find . Previously it would show the amount of time you were in a fat burn during an activity. You are not able to see the splits of your walks or runs on the map anymore. The map details are now minimal. Am looking at other options from other companies with these changes.,1.0
Dawn Howell,Functional,"I love this app but since the latest update, my device is not syncing and the time on my device has been incorrect (by about 4 hours).

Nick Groh,Functional,"Still trash on 10/19.....Latest 10/2 update does not fix the below. New app does not allow workouts to be modified. Can hit the pencil icon and try to update type field but does not allow for keyboard entry or even a drop down selection... Premium recipes. In video form only with zero actual instructions and ingredients list, and no nutrition info. Removing challenges, adventures, and groups helps put the nail in the coffin.",1.0
Amber Shea,Functional,"Nothing is correct. I refresh it multiple times and it still does not show the sleep I just woke up from. New UI also looks terrible. Looked fadded and bland, horribly inaccurate data. The fit bit is essentially useless with this horrible app update. Ruined a previous quality product.

Total disrespect to users with this huge downgrade and with the responses acting like it's a user issue.",1.0
Jonathan Smith,Functional,"The old version had a display for battery level on the main screen so I knew when to charge my watch. The new version does not. So now my watch dies before I know it needs to be recharged. The old version displayed all exercise separated by week with an indicator of heart rate zones. Very useful. The new version makes you click each log entry to see heart rate zone minutes. Worse, you have to scroll week by week then select the specific log entry. Useless. I also have to turn my watch off and",1.0
Katt Ness,Functional,"If you forget to wear it and try to add exercise, it only allows you to enter whole numbers. If you walk a mile and a half, you can only enter 1 OR 2 miles. Not 1.5 miles. And you can't save unless you enter calories burned. How am I supposed to know that number? I wasn't wearing my Fitbit! Lastly, the sleep report is useless, unless you can compare REM with wakeup. Why even have it?? I've been meaning to replace Fitbit with a better smart watch. Thanks for the push. Fitbit can't be trusted.",1.0
Sue Leinberger,Functional,"Why do they ""fix"" what isn't broken? I'm joining the one star review club - the update is NOT an improvement. Scrolling and searching for all the info that was easy to find previously. When I start tracking a workout on the (fully charged )device it starts ok but then quits and screen goes blank. When I put it on the charger it shows that it's charged, when I restart the device it shows a much lower percentage charged. Can't even find my workout on the app. Horrible.",1.0
Patti Stoneham,Functional,"As others have stated, Fitbit is great but the ""fresh new look"" leaves a lot to be desired. Colors are ill-defined and data is hard to read.

Kina Sakuraba,Functional,"Fitbit Premium is twice as much money for a service that was half as good as Fitbit Coach. It's very disappointing that they got rid of Coach and didn't at least move the workouts to there, I loved all the guided outdoor walks the most. They let me play my own music while a trainer told me when to speed up or slow down. I got to try Premium, my music didn't get turned down while they talked & it was an audio mess. Coach was a better service. Challenges are gone now. Now it's ugly and generic.",1.0
Kevin Gilyard,Functional,"I'm on at least my 5th watch. And the most you can get out of these watches is a year and half at the most.

It's a known issue that they won't address. My new watch will definitely be a new brand",1.0
Anne Koiv,Functional,"The latest update re-ordered the various section trackers to different places. Since I only care about a few of them, the new format is not easily accessed for me. The old order was better. If there was a way to re-order the sections to better suit each individual, it would be much more useful. The Sleep monitor has never been accurate. And now my H2O log displays 0 (zero) on the main screen even though the second screen does still total my water intake. Not sure how to fix it.",1.0
Jen Mahdavi,Functional,"Update broke my data. My Pixel watch/Pixel6 phone used to track heart rate and sleep. I can still see these on the watch, but they haven't synced to the app or web since the update. I've uninstalled the app. I've unpaired the watch. I've cleared the cache.... no data. I'm a premium subscriber, too. FIX IT 2 days later... Useless tech support and it still doesn't work. Don't tell me to change settings when everything stopped working right when the app updated.",1.0
KateOH,Functional,"It was better before the October 2023 update. I can no longer see estimated calories left to eat for the day. I realize I can see what I've burned and what I've consumed but that still doesn't tell me the estimated amount left for the day. This was the most useful feature for losing weight using the app, in my opinion. I don't like having to change screens on my phone to find the battery level & battery doesn't seem to last as long now. I feel like I can switch to a regular watch now.",1.0
Simon Baar,Functional,"The update from a week or so ago completely bricked my Fitbit Flex 2. I'm unable to sync or even connect it to the app. After the update it refused to sync.

Rory Wiens,Functional,"Tried to like the new app, but it really is awful. Even when you try to make it similar to the old layout, it just isn't as functional. I used to use the app 2 or 3 times a day to monitor various things; now I maybe open it once a week. Unfortunately, I just bought a new watch 2 weeks prior to the update to replace my previous one. Fitbit also doesn't offer refunds for premium, but I will be looking elsewhere once my subscription ends.",1.0
Michelle Krasser,Functional,"I used to love the fitbit app. It was my favorite app, but the new design has changed that. It is not enjoyable to look at, the layout of the info has changed and it is not intuitive at all. All the metrics look the same.

Sandra Adams,Functional,"It's a fail. Every since fitbit change over to Google, I have not been able to effectively use my fitbit. All I ever do is recharge it.

I would really like to go back to the old app, please.",1.0

M,Functional,"Aside from the insanely bright new design, a lack of dark mode, and the disappearance of the battery % in the app. The most annoying thing is my data that keeps disappearing.

I regret having upgraded my tracker within the Fitbit brand, since it's been steep downhill lately.",1.0

First Last,Functional,"Now on v4.02.1. STILL No bug fixes just horrible changes to the visuals and mandatory location always on, which is a big intrusion into privacy. ZERO STARS. Update 10-Nov-2023 Google announced that Fitbit is leaving almost 30 countries.",1.0
Mark Hands,Functional,"The new app is form over function. Can't compare runs, can't event see the seconds for 5k runs, so if you've shaved 30 seconds off your run - good luck knowing that. Unlike Samsung Health, I can't add different metrics to the chart such as heart rate, cadence, elevation, pace. What's the point in having the app if you can't extract useful information from it? If this was tested with focus groups before release, you really need to change who you're doing focus groups with.",1.0
KP,Functional,Bought the Ace3 for my daughter and we have spent days unsuccessfully trying to add her Google account to the app. The app won't let supervised account be registered which is the only type of account a child can have!

Reply to fitbit: Followed those instructions could not move past step 4 (login into fit using their account). Contacted support. No solution. Terrible.,1.0
Kori G,Functional,The newest update is the worst update I've seen in an app in years. I have been a DEDICATED user even through the charge 4 band issue. Thus app update is the biggest thing making me consider a switch Also - I can only enter whole miles into exercise tracking. This is ridiculous because I do a lot of shorter stints that need to be tracked. Please fix your app,1.0
Ian Dyke,Functional,The latest version of the app has removed so many features it is now a shadow of its former self. Presumably this is prelude to it disappearing completely as Google tries to force everyone over to Pixel. Go elsewhere.,1.0

Update on my review: I received an email with a link to support me with my issue. Guess what?: I need to buy the premium to get to the old features I loved!! Now definitely Garmin!",1.0
Amanda Wendell,Functional,Not happy at all with the update. I have to shut my phone off and my fit bit off everyday just to get them to sync together. Or uninstall the app and reinstall it. My phone and fit bit no longer automatically talk to each other. I don't get my txt messages or phone calls on it anymore. Please fix the issues or put it back the way it was. No one seems to like the update. If the problem is not fixed soon you are losing customers at a very high rate. Every review has expressed how unhappy we are.,1.0
Doug Pinkham,Functional,"I completely dislike the new layout of the app. It displays the information, but the new layout sucks. The old one was SOOOO much better! It was colorful, and the 'fireworks' when goals were achieved was a lot of fun. Also, the daily average was a great motivator. So make it like it used to be. With more color, daily steps average, fireworks animation, and show battery level in the app. Thank you.",2.0
Kaleigh Mueller,Functional,"Since the app update, I can not get my Versa 2 to sync. I deleted the versa 2, and now, I can not get it to Bluetooth pair the app and watch. I'm super disappointed in the update. It's more complicated to navigate. Give me the old version back. It seems that if more than one person is having an issue, it's more than likely the app it's self. Major design flaw. Do better fitbit.",2.0
Amanda Shaw,Functional,"I have a premium account and am a stats junkie. I tried to give the new update a chance before forming an opinion. It's been a month now. I don't have connectivity issues, it works just fine. The layout is unappealing (even after I've personalized it). All of the white space makes it hard for the eyes to scan and find the stats I'm looking for. My greatest wish would be to more easily switch between my charge 5 and my versa 4 throughout the week.",2.0
Jessie McCall,Functional,"Editing my review, since things have changed. Originally, I found out the app and my old phone were not compatible. I later upgraded my phone and it worked great. I loved it for 2 1/2 years. Now... since Google took over, I have to unpair and re-pair every couple of days to sync everything up. This is definitely not user friendly. Getting really frustrated and thinking of getting rid of my fitbit and deleting the app. It's not worth that hassle.",2.0
Erika Robeck,Functional,"Not a fan of the new update. As previous reviewers have said, the interface is now bland and boring. Gone are the motivators to reach and reinforcers for achieving your goals. Now all you see when you reach a goal is a barely visible, tiny check mark. There used to be clear visuals that made sense and even fireworks if you met all your goals. On the exercise tab, there were little messages of encouragement. Maybe these were viewed as silly, but sometimes people need a little silly to keep going.",2.0
Emmy Chaussee,Functional,"I HATE the update! It ruined the app. Not only is the new layout visually unappealing, but it's also much harder to navigate. The update took the app from polished and user friendly to what I can only describe as a ""first-draft"" layout. And worst of all, since the update Fitbit won't sync properly to my other apps! I've tried everything that's been suggested by support and other users, and nothing fixes the issue. Please listen to your users and return it to the previous design!",2.0
Bree Z.,Functional,"I used to love this app, but since the redesign I've been extremely unhappy. (And for the record, everyone I've spoken to about it feels similarly.) The overall look is unsatisfying, but the main issue is that you can't see the battery percentage from the app. It doesn't even show when it is actively charging! This is wildly inconvenient. Frankly, it should also tell you how long until a full charge, just like most cell phones do when they are charging. You have the ability to make this right.",2.0
Diane S,Functional,"App used to be great, but I've dropped it a couple of stars with this recent update. Please bring back the colors for Zone minutes. The new shades are tough to distinguish. The old circle with yellow, orange, and red was much easier to read. All the features look alike now, with the same boring white background and black font. It also used to show your battery % when you sync'd it. Now I don't see that on the homepage. Please bring back colors! 10/27/23 update: Now the app won't sync with my lux",2.0
Bob Bray,Functional,The new app is not nearly as functional as the previous version. The zone exercise does not break down fat burn and cardio data like the previous version. The weekly review only provides the very last week. The previous version allowed me to scroll through several months of activity. The layout does not use different colors to display results versus goals. It is definitely a step back.,2.0
Julie Denton,Functional,"Lots of issues since the update. I have had a Pixel Watch for one year now. The app was great at first but since the last update it doesn't sync well - super glitchy. The monochromatic design makes it harder to navigate. It also doesn't give me daily credit for exercising even when I do ""intense activity"" for up to an hour! I'll get 60-100 zone points in a 60 min workout but it doesn't consider that to be ""exercise""...? So annoying. Considering a different interface when I replace my watch.",2.0
Tyson B,Functional,"Dont know why Google had to go and mess up the app. The app functions which is the only reason I gave it two stars. Other than that, the layout is confusing and not efficient. Also the removal of friend challenges is a major strike for me. The only reason I've stayed with fitbit for years was for friend challenges and the ""gamification"" of workouts. At least now I guess I'm free to finally move on and try something else.",2.0
Wolf Gang,Functional,"Like most every other fitness app, this one falls short of actually being anywhere near accurate. I'm using the app on a Google Pixel Watch 2. And believe it or not, it's even less accurate than the Apple watch equivalent. You're not going to be able to count on this for any sort of sleep tracking. Steps are accurate if you maintain an average gait and you're moving away from your original starting position. If you're just walking circles mowing the yard, it's nowhere near accurate. Usual fail.",2.0
Leigh P,Functional,"**updated 10/31/23. The issues just keep getting worse. I have to force stop the app to get it to sync. This app had a few issues when I had my versa, but since getting a sense I've had more issues than ever. Recently it will just stop syncing and I have to turn everything off and restart. It sucks the battery dry after 2 or 3 days when it's supposed to have a 6 day battery life. It just is frustrating having better tech with an app that seems to be getting less helpful",2.0
Anonymous Anonymous,Functional,"Ever since this last firmware update, my heart rate tracker and sleeping tracker do not work. I cannot seem to get the green led lights back on. I have turned the hr feature on and off, I have restarted the phone and Fitbit, I have even factory reset. Nothing brings them back. And to make matters worse, before it stopped working it scared me into thinking I was having a heart attack. REALLY HIGH readings! Then it just stopped working.",2.0
Kay M. Blond,Functional,The new design isn't efficient or easy to navigate. The zones are similar in color compared to the old one where you could instantly look at the bright colors and you knew immediately knew how much time you had in each zone. Update big disappointment. Canceled my premium subscription. Not worth it anymore.,2.0
Lee Troska,Functional,"Please bring back the battery% level! Who thought removing that was a UI improvement? I checked that as often as my steps. Medium can mean anywhere from 30% to 70%? That's not useful. Also, I don't like almost all of the other updates. The entire UI experience took several steps backwards, IMO. I'll be looking for a non-Fitbit alternative when my current tracker dies.",2.0
Elaine Stegg,Functional,"Was a 5, now a 2. I've used Fitbit for more than 5 years and have been very satisfied with it. The new layout is all show with little helpful substance. I now get better info on my Inspire, which isn't a complete picture. Whatever ""better"" idea the new ownership thinks they have is a mistake. Ap won't sync manually. It syncs randomly 3-4 times a day. No where near enough and not when I need it. Very disappointing.",2.0
J H,Functional,"I have been using a Fitbit for years and started with a flex, moved to an Alta HR, and have been using an Inspire 2 for years. Previous syncing issues did get resolved and the Inspire works much better than the other models. I was enjoying it. The new app published is a complete disappointment. Details and views that were helpful are no longer available. I seriously miss the challenges and group connection that was once a foundation of Fitbit.",2.0
Tony Davila,Functional,"Ever since the last update, the app no longer shows the fitbit device battery level upon pulling down to refresh. Please bring it back. I know I can see it on my wrist, but some of us don't ever even see the watch since you have all data in the app. Also with the ""update"", we lost ability to fully customize our ""today"" feed. You can rearrange categories but can no longer rearrange the order of items within each category.",2.0
Rebecca Sass,Functional,"I loved Fitbit. Before the updates that Google has made. I want to stay loyal, but it seems to be downgrading fast. They have taken away many things that made Fitbit awesome (challenges and games) and why I chose this fitness watch to begin with. If they don't update soon, I may just need to walk away sadly. The last ""upgrade was the worst. The home screen isn't as customizable as before and it is sad looking. Bring back the old version. It was a lot better.",2.0
Janis Litchfield,Functional,"Feb 2020 - The app regularly fails to sync with device. It's fantastic when it works but has to be removed and reinstalled regularly, sometimes as often as several times in a day. *** UPDATE May 2020 - Called customer care again, had a better experience this time. They were able to fix the problem remotely and now my Ionic works quite well. Thanks! Oct 2023 - I've had a Charge 5 for 3 yrs now. The new update is atrocious. Ugly UI, poor functionality, missing data. Ready to change tracker.",2.0
Gerardo Leal,Functional,"I used to love this app. But the new redesign is simply terrible and removes functionality..I use it on a pixel phone and cannot longer rename workouts ..this means I am stuck only with the few preset quick access ones and cannot rename.them climbing when I climb for example...they stay as ""workout"". I cannot think of a single thing that improved and I can think of many that became worst...is one of those redesign for the sake of redesign.Sad.",2.0
Michael Griesi,Functional,"The latest update is horrible. Aside from the lame look and newly restrictive customization, the data updates are very buggy. The calorie and water tracking is constantly confused about what day it is and the reported data is often a day off from the tracked data. I gave 2 stars since at least the data seems to be stored and not completely lost.",2.0
Jessica S,Functional,"Edit Now it's back to not syncng. As of today 10/31, the app hasn't synced for almost 2 weeks. Ugh, not happy. Like others, I am NOT able to sync my Fitbit Versa 2 Lite. I don't understand why in the last 6 months this has occurred several times. I'm not happy as I like to track my sleep and steps. I tried another no name tracker, and it didn't track anything correctly. Please fix whatever the connection issue is. I'd love to get an new Fitbit, but I have ZERO confidence that it will sync. :(",2.0
Liam Toohey,Functional,"It's hard to find anything positive to say about the app redesign. The muted colors remove the enthusiasm I had for checking data, the design is less intuitive, and the functionality seems to work less well. Additionally the redesign only affects the homepage which makes for a disconnect when you navigate to other screens. I'm not sure if this was just poorly tested, or an effort to push users to Google Fit, but either way I'll likely cancel my premium membership when it's up for renewal.",2.0
S Coston,Functional,"Very much preferred the old interface! My watch works Great and the old interface was well designed and easy to use. Google, don't change things just because you can. Ask first! Don't try to fix this interface, just go back to the old one. Cons: colors to dull and similar, too much scrolling, you averaged data that should be unique, you put important data at the Bottom of pages instead of the top, some chart are just Gone! Just a poor design!",2.0
Brittany Price,Functional,"Great when everything works. I constantly have firmware issues with my scale. It works, then quits for weeks at a time and nothing I do fixes it until it magically decides to update. The app crashes a lot and server errors render it unusable. I pay the membership fee but feel like I can't get my monies worth. I used to love fitbit but the quality has gone down. It almost doesn't seem worth it anymore.",2.0
Joanne M,Functional,"The new app update is awful. If I didn't like my Fitbit so much I would switch to a different product because of the app. The visual presentation is hard to read because of the monochromatic (and ugly) color, it does not organize the info in a visually intuitive way, it's too large and spread out so requires too much scrolling. The previous design was a five so not sure why you would intentionally make your product worse.",2.0
Beautiful,Functional,"I loved this app before the Oct 2, 2023 update. It had different icons for each section that were different colors so it was very easy to find each section and was very user friendly. Now all sections have the same generic look so it's hard to find what you're looking for. The app itself still works as before, but I'm extremely unhappy Fitbit forced us to accept their connection with Google to continue using the app!",2.0
Evan Mapson,Functional,"Can no longer edit the type of auto-recorded exercises, instead automatically picking arbitrary things like ""aerobic"" or ""sport"". Manually added exercises no longer show heart rate or other data like they used to (estimated as it was). Often takes 8-10 refreshes to see today's sleep data even after the number appears on the home screen. And it doesn't account for daylight saving correctly.

Gillian Eldridge,Functional,"This was a good app for years, but recent updates have removed options and reduced functions in an inexplicable way.

Lori Johnson,Functional,"So I don't like the new look, but I've gotten use to it.However as of today, my Charge 5 has stop syncing to the app. Has only doc. 12 steps and I've been up moving around since 9 this morning. it's know 12: 15pm. The app for some reason is not syncing the data from the charge 5. and yes, I checked the bluetooth connection. Trying to stay motivated to continue with my fitness goals but this is not helping.",2.0
Maia,Functional,"What was the point of this update. The colors aren't vibrant. The zone colors on the graphs are not accessible since there's not enough contrast between it. The colors before were intuitive with red, orange, yellow, and blue. The quick view on the home screen is less detailed. There's not even a dark mode. I'm fact it's even brighter than before. Move the days of the week to the top of the monthly activity chart. Let us drag and drop the order on the home screen instead of forcing it in groups",2.0
J.D. Benavidez,Functional,"The new update looks pretty good on the surface level, but there are so many little inconsistencies. Two of the colors used for heartrate zones are nearly identical and can not be distributed in graphs. The page to view a workout does not display heartrate like it did before (though it does for runs). I also can not edit a workout. There is an edit page, but it won't save. Pressing the save button does nothing. Most sections of the app are updated to the new look, but not all of them are.",2.0
Tanya Mysko,Functional,"The new UI is a no. As a designer I know new designs take time to adjust, but some of the changes do not make sense. I have to scroll to find anything I need (almost six full screens for all the info that used to take up far less space). There is a sameness that makes me just gloss over data and I struggle to find what I need. I do like the more minimal charting style, and colors feel more modern. I will try for a little longer and may abandon. Please add compact layout version and a dark mode.",2.0
Richard Adler,Functional,"As many have said already, the recent redesign is a complete UI failure. Difficult to read, bland and boring, and considerably less useful. The old design was very good and reasonablyintuitive. It simply did not need to be rethought, especially in such an amateurish and user hostile way. I used to recommend Fitbit, but if this is a sign of where they're going, those days are passing fast. If they're smart, they'll revert to the old version, but I'm not holding my breath.",2.0
Erich von Hauske,Functional,"Pretty UI at the expense of ease of use. the latest version requires a lot more effort to view your history for a metric, to the point that it is not usable. The previous version did a very good job where one just needed to keep.scrolling and had the weekly totals. But now it looks prettier. I was going to buy a new watch but I'll wait until this is fixed.",2.0
Sharon Trammell,Functional,"I've had more problems with this app since the last update than the previous versions. It's slow to sync and count my steps. Sometimes, it even shows zero steps after I've walked a few thousand steps. I've had to uninstall and re-install several times just to get the app to sync properly. Also, I liked the way the previous versions showed if the battery was low. I liked knowing the percentage rather than ""low,"" ""medium,"" etc. I'm not very pleased with the app's latest update. Please fix it!",2.0
Fran Heddings,Functional,"I've used this app for many years and loved it, until the recent update. The home screen UI isn't user-friendly. The battery level no longer displays, the icons and labels take up too much space, and other essential functionality has been removed or degraded. Including the weekly goal percentage for zone minutes. Now I need to do math to figure it out. Not convenient. Fitbit, please rollback to the previous version.",2.0
John Wickham,Functional,"Oct 2023 app redesign is a huge step backwards. What happened to the battery percentage that was always available and showed in the sync? Now users have to take multiple steps just to get an approximate battery level... Ridiculous. Asthecally it does look cleaner. The UX asks the user to ""prioritize"" what they'd like to see which could be useful for some. Not for me. It wasn't very difficult to scroll down a bit to see what wasn't on top or tap for details.",2.0
C. Thomas,Functional,"This latest upgrade is terrible. It misses syncing portions of the activities. For example, it did not sync the last segment of my sleep or the last segment of the hourly activity. It is difficult to read and needs too many steps to get to the information I want. The older version, while not perfect, was much easier to use. At least, it was syncing properly.",2.0
Brittany Wolf,Functional,"When I first downloaded the app, it was fantastic, and I didn't have any issues. After this most recent update and change, my steps on the app vs. what my watch says are not matching up. A lot of my stats are not accurate after this recent update, and it's frustrating. They've made it let user friendly, and it's not as easy to figure out the charts and graphs. The most recent update has caused me to drop my original four star opinion down to a two. ðŸ˜•",2.0
Robin Stillwater,Functional,"I got a fitbit because people rave about them, so I figured it was worth a little extra money. Unless something big changes, I definitely will not be getting another. Mild issues with the screen being too dim, but mostly issues with the app. It takes literal minutes to sync, up to 5 minutes, sometimes it won't sync at all, and now with the newest update it's saying it requires background location services to sync even though it actually doesn't. Very disappointing!!",2.0
Nicholas Harrison,Functional,"Not working well since the update Ok, so the update is very minimalist in terms of color and that isn't appealing for me, but the real issue is not only does it seem like it stopped synching in the background with my watch, there are times when it just fails to synch at all. Again, not an issue before the update so I don't think it's a hardware thing. My watch is less than a year old. I do like the custom dashboard with goals, and the disappearance of the ""tips"" that were unnecessary.",2.0
Jerry Ham,Functional,"This design refresh is bad (for example you cannot put the items you want into the order that you want, you can only move groups that are, within themselves, order locked. This means more scrolling to see what you want. Also, for some reason, the heart rate panel won't even open. Tapping the icon brings up a screen that just clocks forever. All in all, needed some people who actually use it to tell the designers to go back to the drawing board. it is clearly put together by folks that don't use.",2.0
Amber Abernathy,Functional,This new update is not great. Harder to read and screaming white. There is no good reason not to have a dark mode. I'll give back the other two stars when there's a dark mode option. You also can't check battery life on the app anymore. That was a convenient feature to check on while it was charging or when you're exercising and can't check it on the band. ***Update: the GPS is also now consistently over one mile short. That should be an adjustable feature.,2.0
Jeannette Hill,Functional,"A problem that has carried over from the older app version is that after I sync, I have to close out the app and open it again for any steps that were synced to show up in the graphs. After the most recent update, location services must be enabled all the time in order to sync with the Fitbit. It was much better before, when I could enable it only while using the app. When it comes time to replace my Fitbit, I will be checking out other options if this is still required.",2.0
David Cammack,Functional,"The new Fitbit app look is worse. This seems to be a trend with most products, especially software--over time, they get worse. The metrics are dull and harder to distinguish. The dashboard is comprehensively less informative, and the color scheme is more bland. While I Iike the increased functionality (which is why I gave it 2 stars), I'd rather have the old look back.",2.0
Lee Martin,Functional,"I'm very disappointed in this new revision. I have been actively using Fitbit since 2012, and this is the biggest jump backward so far. My primary areas of concern are colors, font size, GPS mapping, and the ability to organize screens to meet my needs. I was afraid that acquisition by Google was going to be a hostile takeover and these ""improvements"" seem to support this theory.",2.0
Mike Lieder,Functional,"App redesign is alright once you get used to it, but doesn't seem necessary and isn't an improvement on what was there. It also took away the ability to edit an exercise type after. For instance, it automatically records me mowing the lawn as mountain biking. Before I could just edit that and everything was fine, but now you can't even edit this.",2.0
A Ronan,Functional,"Not a fan of the newest release. The design looks very dated and less polished than the previous version. The battery percentage doesn't show now which is just silly - why would you remove a critical piece of info from the main screen? I also loved seeing my total steps for the week and while it's still available it's much less prominently featured. I'm not opposed to change, but I don't see any improvement with this overhaul. It's only made it look silly and taken away things I liked.",2.0
Julie F (JulieNStLouie),Functional,"The latest app update messed up my fitbit inspire 2. The new version wants to to sync with Google. It will no longer pair on Bluetooth. It shuts down often and no longer syncs my data. I tried to chat with Fitbit, and they couldn't figure out what was wrong (3 different people). They left me out in the cold. I am very disappointed. Now I have to spend more time tomorrow to try to fix it and also try calling customer service.",2.0
Anna L,Functional,"Another big update that doesn't help. They changed the color scheme for heart rate zones in maps and charts to a muted, ugly design that makes it harder to differentiate between zones. I like that I can customize what appears on my screen, because I want to spend as little time as possible in the app. I think the next time I buy a fitness tracker, I'll be moving away from FitBit, because the app keeps getting worse.",2.0
Sherry Oldham-Coffee,Functional,I loved the old version. This new updated version isn't as good. They need to bring back a lot of the old features. I want the little graph that showed what my heart rate did while exercising back instead of a generic plain number telling me how many zone minutes and nothing else. I like being able to see how my heart was responding to each exercise. I use a rowing Machine quite frequently and now have to look it up each time to log exercise instead of it being easily accessed. New needs work!,2.0
Mandy B,Functional,"The update to the layout is terrible. I've been using the app to monitor my heart rate during my workouts and now that chart is gone. So is the zone chart. The whole layout for workouts took away so much information. Please fix this. Edited to add: App won't let you edit the type of workout either, you have to delete the whole thing and manually add it back to change it.",2.0
Doneka D'Amore,Functional,"I hate the new update. I used to get on it several times a day, tracking my food, my water, inputting my workouts if my Fitbit happened to be dead at the time of exercise, checking sleep scores, etc etc. It was inviting, bright, colorful, fun to use, engaging, easy to navigate and explore. Now it's the embodiment of the audio for the Clear Eyes commercial. Looking at the monochromatic dashboard and the new layout sucks the joy right out of me. Why, Fitbit? Why???",2.0
Brandon Farinha,Functional,"Hate the new update. The monochrome style is horrible, it's harder to navigate, and it's not syncing correctly. I did a 3 mile walk this morning and the app is saying i only put in 1.75 despite the fact that the map shows the route taken. Also the new map view is pointless, as it no longer shows mile markers. The whole interface looks like a 5 year old's refrigerator drawing.",2.0
Daniella Rollman,Functional,"Hate the new updated look on the app, dislike the forced change to Google, which changed it even further. There isn't a way to change it back to the original look. The new look is just awful, difficult to navigate, and just poor overall. I have used fitbit for a couple of years and had the premium. With all the new updates and changes, I don't feel as though I will continue.",2.0
N,Functional,"Minus the heart rate issues with my versa three, I let that slide due to the connectivity and ease of use. But, now with the major update, my versa 3 struggles to sync to my phone, and getting tired of the fact that the time won't automatically update when I travel, even though it is set to. User interface has become convoluted as well, and the graphics are now lacking.",2.0
Stephanie G,Functional,"I have issues with the latest update. It is harder to see my day at a glance. For exercise days, it's only creating a heartrate graph on autotracked activities & not on manual ones. The colors in the graph are very hard to distinguish now. I can't record as much on certain activities, like miles on the treadmill. The main screen only shows the most recent exercise for the day. I used to be able to swipe through. There's no zone summary for activities or sleep stages on the main screen anymore.",2.0
Rachel Eckelberry,Functional,"I used to really enjoy the functionality of this app. Now I can no longer customize my home screen to have zone minutes at the center, I have to drop several layers deep to see my weight loss, and I have to fumble around every time to try to see my workout stats. Because of how cumbersome this is, you're actually driving my traffic to other integrated apps for me to be able to see what I want.",2.0
T Summers,Functional,"What happened to the app? The new user interface is terrible and not user-friendly. The previous cards were perfect, and now it has been ""downgraded"" with a UI that is so sparse and completely unappealing. I don't like that so many features have been taken away. Unfortunately, after 6 years, I am going to look for another fitness watch/app. This is no longer an option.",2.0
Judy collier,Functional,"I am not a fan. It is inconsistent and hard to sync. It doesn't always update promptly and sometimes one value updates, but others don't.Too much white space, and I don't like having my weight displayed. Figuring our how to log my weight loss wasn't easy. The old app was MUCH better. If I had a choice, I would go back to it in a heartbeat.",2.0
Elisa Lambert,Functional,"I love this app, but the new redesign is awful. I would have rated four or five stars prior to the change. Some info I used a lot is gone like the heart rate zones chart for a workout. Navigation in general is clunkier and things are a little more burried on the app. Rather than being clean and sleek which I assume was the intended design, it is much harder to see the information since everything blends together. I hope they fix it!",2.0
Michael Vinson,Functional,"This app was great, that is until the latest update. Before you could edit an activity to change the duration and the app would adjust calories, etc. You could change the type of exercise that was automatically detected and it would recalculate based on the new type of exercise. None of that works now. Based on this update, I can no longer recommend getting Fitbit Premium. All of the useful benefits are no longer available.",2.0
Robin Swecker,Functional,The app used to give you the option to set silent alarms and change them easily. I have used the alarms daily for years. Now you have to log into a desktop account and dig layers deep to find and change the alarms. Update after Sept 2023 app update. I reduced to 2 stars because the new layout is visually less appealing and harder to customize to what you want to track. Makes me want to switch to a different product.,2.0
Angela Stevens (Shorti),Functional,"This new design sucks. What was the purpose? Did people ask for these features, or do you just not care what people want? Do the designers actually use the app? It certainly isn't user-friendly. The ability to customize my list of stats is gone. Now, I have to scroll through to find the ones I am looking for. The battery percent is no longer conveniently on the home page. Instead its under devices, and all I get from that is the low medium high? The colors are totally bland and useless.",2.0
Janelle A,Functional,"The app just updated with a poorly designed new interface. Design is not intuitive, very accessible, or visually pleasing. It also looks extremely dated now. Additionally, you can see a slew of negative reviews from the past several days as people received this update, complaining about the same things and apparently new functionality issues. Yet the company, without warning is continuing to force it onto users. At least having the option to revert to the previous version would be preferable",2.0
Sovrim Terraquian,Functional,"Wildly inconsistent data updates limit the usefulness of the app. The home screen may list a sleep score but you can't find the details on the sleep tab. Your calorie counting page may or may not correctly give you the number of calories, and that number may not match the intake shown on the home page. When the app works it's fine, but the inconsistencies make it hard to trust the data it provides.",2.0
Jil Slegh,Functional,"Not a fan of the new design. AND, the exercise app on my device (Sense) stopped working, all suggestions to fix it were followed but didn't resolve the issue. Attempts to contact Fitbit have been unsuccessful, so I don't know if it's the upgraded phone app that messed up the device or what is going on. Big disappointment to spend so much on a device to have issues with it a little over a year later.",2.0
Holly Graham,Functional,"I had issues before the update with my sleep not syncing or taking several hours to show up in the app, but the app was user-friendly. This new update is just trash. It's not user-friendly and is unsightly. Looks like a cheap version of what once was. I've had enough issues with my Charge 5 to turn me away from fitbit, and now the app is trash. I definitely won't purchase another fitbit product.",2.0
Rafe S,Functional,"Dark mode! This app needs a dark mode or to not interfere with my phones dark mode. Because of the update I can't keep my phones dark mode on because it makes stuff on this app invisible. Also, this app is visually not easy to interpret (particularly the graphs). Finally, I want to be able to see the graph show the last 7, 30 days, 3, 12 months; not just a static set of time.",2.0
Yvonne Hernandez,Functional,"The new app is too bright. Add the option to add some dark colors to the layout that will be easier on the eyes and can differentiate between the different metric categories. It currently looks very dated and as if you are reading off of an old MS Word report template. For a modern app, we want efficiency acheived by more data available at every screen. Now we have to scroll more times because we are seeing less data at every screen. This is very inefficient.",2.0
Susan Hawk,Functional,"The new ""clean look"" app is terrible. Not enough visual data with my exercises. I miss the daily tips that used to appear when I opened the app. It looks boring AF. I can't find anything. I don't like being forced to choose only ONE goal (fitness OR weight OR sleep OR mindfulness). I want to see ALL my options, like I could before. By cleaning it up, you've made it far less useful. I want my data back.",2.0
Ivy V,Functional,"I was really enjoying my Fitbit and app for a long time, but now the app has drastically changed and become very convoluted and user un-friendly. you have to keep clicking into sub sections just to find basic stats. please put it back like it was or at least give the option. app functionality is a huge part of staying with Fitbit over other trackers.",2.0
Christine Sawatzke,Functional,"Been a Fitbit patron for many, many years and devices. Ups and downs for sure but I'm pretty loyal. Latest update is a disaster. I went from 5-6 day charge to 24-36 hours... very upset. It also constantly notifies me that it isn't tracking steps yet if I open the app and manually sync, it goes away. I should not need to do this. I want the old app back.",2.0
LK Sochay,Functional,"The new UI in the app is awful - not intuitive at all - wasting too much of my time trying to find things that I used to use everyday. Didn't save previous preferences. Users have no interest in learning another layout and resetting what they've already set in the app previously. Also, there was no quick walk-thru tutorial to show a user what has changed and how to navigate it. Yet another reason to start looking for something different next time I need to buy a fitness watch.",2.0
Kim Craven,Functional,"Revised rating. The latest update in October 2023 is extremely disappointing. I wear my Fitbit on a clip on my body. There are no longer options for wearing it as a clip. It only counts steps as if it was on an arm. That's not how all of your users use this application. It changed my step count. Additionally, I am not happy that they took away the battery indicator. Some of us use that on the app to know when we need to recharge. Please put it back.",2.0
Jennifer Saksa,Functional,The lastest version has been a downgrade. Some of what I used most is either harder to see or non existent despite having lots of things I had to turn off. I'm glad you can turn off elements but rearranging elements is more limited than it was. I am frustrated enough that I am seriously considering switching out of the Fitbit ecosystem when I replace my watch. You are no longer even able to see the charge of your device has which was particularly helpful while charging.,2.0
David Wong,Functional,"I prefer the previous layout where everything is easier to navigate. I really enjoyed using the GPS exercise tracking and stopwatch for my jogging route and time but I can no longer find the option to do so. The automatic exercise tracking isn't as accurate, I would run a mile and walk a mile and the app thinks I walked the whole 2 miles. I do not like manually inputting my exercise time and distance.",2.0
Saurabh Betawadkar,Functional,"Hate the new update. Very buggy with sync issues and is visually not very intuitive. Colors do not make sense and are very bland. The old UI used to be very clear, the new one I need to keep scrolling to find what I am looking for. There is no improvement over the previous version. Seems like Fitbit went 2 steps back.",2.0
Kym Noelle Tocci,Functional,"I've always had trouble with this entire app functioning WITH my watch 100%. IT'S a little frustrating too. Especially for something so expensive NOT to work when it's expected to. Currently, the sleep analytics is hit and miss. But the most irritating, is the watch will not SYNC consistently. I keep having to RESTART my watch for it to connect to the app!? So then my readings don't record and it's not updated properly. Idk what is going on. ""Frustrated"".",2.0
badmews,Functional,"I don't like that it focuses on my steps instead of active minutes anymore, some things aren't customizable anymore. I don't know where this added ""functionality"" is that's being touted. When my device isn't syncing, it simply loads endlessly and stops trying, with no ""fix it"" option or troubleshooting (not that troubleshooting has EVER been helpful with that..). You can try and make a pretty redesign all you want but if it's not broken don't fix it. Wish I didn't update it.",2.0
AnotherDave313,Functional,Fitbit New UI is hot garbage and sync issues remain. I live my fitbit and find the sleep tracking to be by far the most useful feature which was a surprise to me. That said the app had a release about a year ago that introduced sync issues with my android phone. Then they implemented this weird green on white UI on the main page. I feel like I am an A/B tester and the UI is not complete but friends all have the same new garbage skin. Hopefully they correct to something easier to read.,2.0
Christina Freeman,Functional,"Update: I feel like Fitbit devices were already struggling. I was sort of forced to upgrade from my Ionic. I bought a Sense. I have to say, this is a poor device and honestly I feel like Google will be the death of Fitbit. Especially recently. The app is buggy, the watch struggles to keep up! So, I really like most things about the fitbit world. I have two complaints. 1. I wish the period tracking was more intuitive and user friendly. 2. I would love to track fasting within the fitbit app!",2.0
Cavgen J,Functional,"I have been with FitBit since 2016 and have never had an issue with the Tracker or the App. That changed with the Oct 2023 update. Aside from having too many unused features now prominent and not being about to see the battery percentage, my tracked exercises are sporadic in loading.

Really disappointed and hope there is a fix planned fo",2.0
Charley Navasaitis (Sharlay),Functional,"Breaks often, meaning my watch needs a complete reboot to get it to sync. The new UI is ugly and everything looks the same. It just updated and I already hate the changes, everything being the same color means more time looking for the metrics I want. Distinct colors and shapes make it easier to distinguish things, this is the phone app version of a beige house, boring and ugly.",2.0
Mike Boydstun,Functional,"New update doesn't let me organize the stats in the way that I want them (and had them in the previous version). Even within each grouping of the stats you cannot reorder them. Also, I can no longer edit the Auto-Recognized Activity. It thinks that when I am mowing my lawn, I am doing an outdoor bike activity. My Fitbit has always recognized that activity incorrectly, but I could edit the text to properly record it in the old app. But not any longer... sad and disappointing!",2.0
James Hudson,Functional,"The app update is awful! Everything now looks the same; all the colors that divided different sections made it so easy to find what I wanted. Now, everything looks the same, which is confusing and cumbersome for navigating. Also, the sleep tracking is terrible. Half the nights, the watch didn't detect I was asleep. I have to manually enter my times. When it does track my sleep, I only get the detailed results about half the time. Useless. Only tracks my blood O2 levels less than half the time.",2.0
Scott H,Functional,"For nearly six years the community has requested dark mode to help with viewing data at night or early morning (e.g., sleep). Fitbit continues to ignore the Voice of the Customer. Overall the app and data is pretty basic. Insights are trivial and only at the very surface- regardless of subscription. The Oura Ring sets the gold standard in this category with quality data and deep insights coupled with an intuitive interface.",2.0
Beth Robinson,Functional,"Boo to the update! I had to hunt for all of my stuff, waste time setting up my preferred settings, call it silly but I actually loved getting the badges for every 5 pounds I lost, it helped to motivate me...an extra little boost of affirmation. Now I have to wait until I lose 25 more lbs! Yuck. I don't care that I earn the others 130 times. Plus, I just want my data to be easy to find and I don't want to hunt for it. I may seriously have to look into another device if/when this one bites it.",2.0
Kate,Functional,"I've had a Fitbit for several years, and generally I like it, mostly to count steps. Not anymore! The latest update to the app is just awful. It doesn't look good, it's hard to figure out, and basically it does not work. I uninstalled the app just to try to get it to work, and when I reinstalled it I was basically asked to give Fitbit access to all my information and that of my contacts. As soon as I find another fitness watch, I'm out of here! Way to go, Fitbit.",2.0
Lori West,Functional,"Hate the new app. Cartoonish, too big, can't see as much on the main screen and what is there is less helpful. Greatly reduced ability to customize what you want to see and where. Beyond that how the data is displayed takes more effort to see what I'm used to seeing, ex steps for the week and prior. I just want my numbers. Looks like a 6 yr old designed the GUI, no offense to 6 yr old budding cartoonists. Adding to the complaint list: Battery level Heart rate - range not actual?!",2.0
Candace,Functional,"This app has so many issues. Your watch will record a run at 3.5 miles and then it shows in the app as 2.18 miles or something, but you'll look at the laps and it shows 3.5 miles, and if you use the share feature it shows 3.5 miles. And yes, this is after you sync, and wait a bit. Other issues- Some days I will check the app and it says I covered 5 miles that day, but show 220,566 steps. You look later and usually it's fixed, but this means basically you cannot trust the app to have useful data.",2.0
JC C,Functional,"It was fine until the 9/23 update. It's so difficult to read the landing page. Sleep not properly calculating. The HR range for the day was nice, but once you sync, it goes away, leaving just the current HR. For those of us watching bradycardia & tachycardia, it would be nice to have. It's not intuitive how to add & change clocks & only allowing 5 options at a time is annoying. No battery life icon, & NO DARK MODE. I'm seriously thinking of switching to a Samsung Galaxy watch after this!",2.0
Cat B,Functional,I agree with all the negative reviews since the redesign. What is wrong with you tech ppl? Why keep trying to fix what isn't broken? Bad design so user unfriendly. Don't need workout 'suggestions'. Why can't I change anything on the main page/main circle anymore? I want miles to be my focus not steps. Too many clicks to see what you need to see anymore. Interestingly the old version is still on my tablet. So I will refer to that as much as possible. Go back to the previous version that worked!,2.0
Molly Doster,Functional,"I love the old version of this app... The newest update is absolutely terrible. My Fitbit can no longer sync with the app (steps, calories burned, ect.)

Sometimes it doesn't save food or water that is added. I don't understand what the point of this update was....",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I have found the update to have major issues with randomly recording activities inaccurately. Case in point: yesterday a period of time was recorded as being idle and shows no steps taken. In reality, I was walking down aisles in a grocery store and taking steps the entire time. This is not the first time actively has been missed. I have set up auto recording for activity and since the update, the activity has been missed at random on a number of occasions. Very disappointing.",2.0
Qiana Washington,Functional,"The update no longer allows you to edit the exercise when the Fitbit automatically detects it.

Henry Walbesser,Functional,"Just got the latest version and the downgrade is interesting. Most app look to improve as they go. I see Fitbit has gone another way.

Michael Griesi,Functional,"The latest update is horrible. Aside from the lame look and newly restrictive customization, the data updates are very buggy.

Tim Wilson,Functional,"Since Google took over, the app is moving in a bad direction. 1) They keep logging me out hoping I'll switch my credentials over 2) The #1 reason I check the app is to see if my Fitbit is charged and you took that away.

It only counts steps as if it was on an arm. That's not how all of your users use this application. It changed my step count. Additionally, I am not happy that they took away the battery indicator.

Tiwana Thomas,Functional,"Like everyone else, since the update, my fitbit will not sync. I've Uninstaller, etc. etc. etc. nothing works. this socks.

George U,Functional,11-07-23 Update: Latest app update still stinks. Bring back the old UI. Useful feedback for battery life is now gone. You made the main screen display larger but removed the battery status so that at a glance you would know if you needed to charge your device. Bad move,2.0

Teresa,Functional,Hate the new look. Way less customizable. Way worse data. Now you don't get a breakdown of the minutes your zone time is in just the hour which is not helpful at all.

Tina Galler,Functional,"I hate the new fit bit app. I have a hard time navigating all parts of the app. I have to dig to find my steps.I have to dig to find my sleep score,etcetera.

Jeff Jensen,Functional,"This is a joke now that Google has taken over, not I have a glorified watch. It won't sync up independently since the most recent update and doesn't allow active communication with my phone for notifications. UPDATE: Hopefully, this helps others.

JoAnn Wilkinson,Functional,"The app/watch combination is excellent for tracking steps, calories, sleep, and heart rate. The new app doesn't show my Versa 4 battery life. please put that back in. I have to connect to the charger. Also the food log is not user friendly, very hard to locate the foods you commonly eat. There's a recent tab, but you can't search through it, it searches the whole database instead. It doesn't anticipate what goes together, no memory of your frequent meals. Way behind other food log apps.",3.0

I love my fitbit... when it works! So frustrating.",3.0
Geoff K,Functional,"Updated new app version fall 2023. Don't like it, old version was better. I liked being able to see great rare graph during exercise and track heart rate by minute. Nor picking up exercise automatically there way it did before (misses about 40-50%), then when adding exercise manually to log, sometimes doesn't connect exercise info to it (calories, heart rate, etc). The UI is generic and bleh. They took away information from the user.",3.0
Norm Bryan,Functional,"The update is suboptimal; that is, it is less developed than what it replaced. It no longer tracks pulse rate nor the resting rate thus losing for me an important function. Update Thank you, Fitbit, for the response but it does not address the app, rather it addresses the fitbit device. The device tracks pulse; the app which syncs to the device does not, nor does it provide such as an option. In my regard, the update is less functional than before, however such may not be an issue for others.",3.0
Adrian Nicholls,Functional,"It's ok but the latest update appears to have removed battery percentage charged with low/medium/high which is not nearly as useful. I spent ages re-arranging the screen to how I like it and there seems no benefit to me. Meh, if I had to do this every time a phone app updated I'd have no time for anything else. Fast iteration CI/CD is ok in software development but it needs to add value too, not just cause hassle.",3.0
Reid Buyaky,Functional,"Update is horrible. It no longer maps my exercise or recognizes activity. Every fitness entry must be entered manually. If these features (including GPS) are still available it's testimony to how awful the changes were, as they can't be easily found. Please bring them back.

Other features may further change my review.",3.0
Shaquille John,Functional,"- Last review, the data wasn't correct across countries & Time zones but that seems to be fixed. - New Update doesn't reflect on most of the pages, so it's strange to see nice graphics then the old design for everything else... hopefully that's fixed soon",3.0

Is there a way to go back to the previous version?",3.0
Jonna Quigg,Functional,"The app was decent. Now it has lost a star after this redesign. The new redesign is not friendly. Yes, you can customize the snapshot which is nice, but it's all white background is unpleasant and now i have to search and click several times to find the info I want.

Also, I would like to see the ability to track my blood pressure in the app, either by manual entry or BT from my monitor/app (similar to what's savailable for glucose monitoring).",3.0
Alexandrea Brown,Functional,"The app was fairly easy to use prior to the most recent update. I like that they've included a menstrual health tab now and made the video workouts page easier to filter through and find what you need. However, most things were oversimplified to the point that everything looks exactly the same and it's really overwhelming to look at. Especially when you're trying to look at the breakdown of your zone minutes for the day or week. It used to have a clear differentiation between sections. Not a fan",3.0
David Morgan,Functional,"New user interface is not great. A recent update has rearranged all my data and changed the icons for each category. The new look is also not very asthetocally pleasing. Itbis one step away from black & white. I liked the way I had it all set up so I could access the information that I care about. I know that I can rearrange things, to a degree, but have yet to get it all back to an acceptable look. I know that progress has to happen but please offer the option to keep things where they were.",3.0

In fact, some features seem to be missing",3.0
David Smith,Functional,"Down one star. Since the ""upgrade"" I can no longer view the level of charge on my watch. This is useful while it's charging and not on my wrist.

All the underlying screens that produce the information on the main screen are unchanged so no true improvement has occurred.",3.0
A Louise,Functional,"Used to like the app, since the latest update though I do not. I definitely prefer the old look where it showed the zones you did in a bar graph and was easy to see and chart everything.

If not, I will most likely end up uninstalling.",3.0
Monica Price,Functional,"The new app format needs to include the watch's charge. That used to show when it synced. And it needs dark mode. I love this watch. (It is glitchy and inaccurate.) And it would have 5 stars except that I bought it because of all of the features. Yet some of those features were not described as only being available with a premium subscription. I spent a lot of money for this thing and I'm supposed to pay more for the features I bought it for? Not just more, but monthly more. Not cool.",3.0
Martin Tubens,Functional,I updated the fibit app and now I can no longer see the battery charge level on the app. Originally you would pull down the screen and it will sync revealing the progress of battery charge.

Rick Kissel,Functional,"After the upgrade I cannot find the battery percent of my sense. This was important while the watch was charging. I was hoping the update would fix the graphs, and go back to the previous graphs prior to July 2022 when you could expand the graphs and give you more options. This was really just a cosmetic update with some functionality removed. I don't see any functionality added.",3.0
Steve Sorenson,Functional,"Not a fan of the new layout. Seems solely like change for change's sake. One thing that got lost in the ""update"" is the battery status. Used to be able to see the percentage full in the progress bar during a refresh. Not any more. Now, the user has to click on device (upper left corner home page), click on the device's name, but it no longer tells you the percentage full/empty. Overall not worth updating.",3.0
Kadence Barksdale,Functional,"The app is nice it all. That is when it works. I have to restart my phone once a week just so that my fitbit will sync to the app. I've tried everything on the help document, and nothing works. My family members have the same problem.

Emma Lockard,Functional,"The new look in the home screen/dashboard is so blah! Not liking how everything is one color. Makes it SUPER difficult to see the different categories and tracking features.

I don't like how it thinks when I sit down to read that I am sleeping and counts that as sleeping.",3.0
Lee Ludlam,Functional,"This new version doesn't show the battery charge on my charge 5 without going into the settings, whereas it used to be on the main screen when you refreshed the page or synced the app. Put it back on the main page, please!

Things like the map for walks/runs and heart rate during the activity as well.",3.0
Destiny Frost,Functional,"Yeah I appreciate Fitbit trying to finally update the UI after all of these years but I feel like it went in the wrong direction. I think the reason why it feels harder to read is because all of the components have the same color whereas before different components had their own colors and look to them. It is now too bland and a hard adjustment to get used to. I say give us the option to let users customize the colors on our UI, I think that would be a big help.",3.0
Heather Foliart,Functional,"In theory it's great. In practice, every update breaks it. I end up having to completely uninstall and reinstall each time because the watch, app and/or phone (any combo of all three) messes up and won't properly communicate. Frustrating as hell because it's happened with three different phones, so it doesn't matter if it's Apple or Android, or which version of Android. Every update to Fitbit app breaks it.",3.0
Richard Maeda,Functional,"What happened to the charge level? Before the update when I ""dragged"" the screen down to refresh the data I could see the charge level (80%, etc) of my fitbit. Am I just missing it in the update? Can I revert back to the old version? Not a fan of the new graphics either. If your new ""battery level"" is accessed by the icon in the upper left, then tapping my device (inspire hr) it has shown ""medium"" for 3 days, no indication of percentage. The percentage was also very useful while charging",3.0
Lianne Barre,Functional,"Have to agree with the others...the new version is visually unappealing, no colour and huge font, battery life is gone.

Edit: Thanks for the reply but I tried all the troubleshooting options several times. I'll consider contacting customer support.",3.0
Brandon Houck,Functional,"The new aesthetic looks nice. However, I miss being able to see my total monthly steps on the Year tab. Yes, I can do math and convert average daily to monthly, or I can scroll back through dozens of previous months one by one, but I would like this feature back to remove the tedium from the new UX. Total steps are more important to me than average daily. To cater to everyone, just show both in all cases.",3.0
Phil Tuton,Functional,"I have been using Fitbit trackers for man years. I went through the terrible goole transition and ended up buying the new Charge 5. I'm happy with my new 5. However, the new application is poor. I had better control of the application in the previous version. I like being able to see the metrics important to me up front. In my case, they're sleep, heartrate, and glucose. I really miss not having a fitbit battery percentage of charge displayed. This design really needs an improved UI.",3.0
Ashley Millette,Functional,"The app is wildly glitchy. It doesn't consistently prompt me to calibrate my run distance, and if I try to modify it in the app after the fact, it throws an error that the distance is invalid if I try to give it a decimal, ie, 3.1, gives no error if I submit a full number, ie, 3 miles, but then it also doesn't update the actual workout with that value after saving.",3.0
C Moore,Functional,"I love the app and the insight it provides but I really don't like the new UI at all. It's unusual for me to have anything but good things to say about Google or Fitbit.

I subtracted two stars and I'm hoping this UI can be refined in short order.",3.0
Deb Durant,Functional,"The last update looks pretty but it has removed features that I found helpful. I can't change my clock face since the ""gallery"" option doesn't seem to find the internet - although I am connected both by wi-fi and cellular; and it does not show my battery charge level. The numbers on my Charge 3 are small and faint. I had hoped to change the clock face in hopes that the battery level would be more visibile but I can't do that either. I need to change my device - and it won't be a Google product.",3.0
Christopher Hudson,Functional,"The app does a lot of things well, like the exercise tracking. It's nice to have the built in calorie counter. Unfortunately, if there's ever a problem, the support is worthless. The heart rate tracker doesn't work well for me and the UI is not intuitive. Also having to pay a monthly subscription is a real bummer.",3.0
Dakota,Functional,"New theme is uninspiring. Color scheme is depressing with no alternative options or way to revert to older version. User Interface has also become less clear to navigate as there is less distinction between features. All together the app feels as though it has taken a step backwards in usability and lost it's flare. On a positive note, the functionally of the band and various features of the app operate fine.",3.0
dlstanf2,Functional,"No Street Names on Map What's happening with the street names on my GPS map? Had no issues previously. Have the Charge 6. How am I supposed to keep up with my walks/runs when I take different routes. Now I do like many other things about the Charge 6 compared to the Charge 5. The side button makes it easier to ensure I put my band on correctly, rather right side up. Haven't tried all the features yet. I'm sure I will like those. Just Google Maps without street names... that's hust not right.",3.0
robert mallik,Functional,Not very intuitive. Battery indicator has vanished so have to go to look on watch while charging. And the map in the activity tile no longer shows street names. This is a major issue for tracking exercise. Update: 10/16/23. App now crashing and error messages says (paraphrasing) app is being force closed because there is a bug. Try installing updated app! I think this is what happens when you try to merge Fitbit OS with Google.,3.0
michel hanna,Functional,"The app has been lately much better overall. However, for the past 5 months it's a totally different story. I had to remove my watch every few weeks otherwise the app won't sync with it. Many times the app will override the old values of my exercise and push it on my watch, deleting the last better numbers. It sounds like cutting cost is finally paying dividends at goog. I will give this a try for two more weeks and I might lower the review. Such a wasted potential of a great product ðŸ˜•",3.0
Kort Sandberg,Functional,"I was very disappointed with the latest Google UI updates (9/27/23) to Fitbit app. Using it days later is still very frustrating.

Patricia Afuola,Functional,"I don't care for the new update 4.1 at all. Especially since the heart rate information is spotty. Often not displaying even after refreshing or syncing. Also every little thing I change causes it to revert back to a previous sync and still no current heart rate ,just low-high range is displayed. Just change it back, the way it was worked fine, please.",3.0
ann sawyer,Functional,I like using this to track my activity and sleep. But the update that hit this week has a disappointing feature: it no longer shows the battery charge level. Given that they know about the black screen problem (failure of device screen) it'd have been nice to continue being able to see the charge level in the app. But nope.,3.0
Goat of Music,Functional,"Sometimes Extremely Slow and far Too Many Updates. This app is slow to sync when doing it manually(usually when it doesn't do it itself, which happens often) and will take exceedingly long to sync or sometimes not even sync at all. This, with the updates that you need to download about 3 times a week-the app won't seem to work at all otherwise-is the reason for my rating. And, for someone who relies on this to track my sleep health, running into these issues makes it difficult to do so.",3.0
J Ross,Functional,"Aside from having issues setting up SMS, I really like what this app does. I do notice now on the newest update that I can no longer monitor my battery on my smart device. I don't like that I can't monitor that. Therefore, I had to lower my rating. My watch no longer shows a percentage. At 75%, the app shows full charge. The previous version followed what the watch displayed.",3.0
A Headings,Functional,The new update is ok. I don't hate it but I don't love it either. The one feature that is missing is something that shows me how much of my watch battery is left. It used to be on the main page and now this feature is gone. A less obvious 'battery left' option is a few layers in the new app. Please put this feature back on the main page so I know when I need to recharge.,3.0
Ross Thoma,Functional,"Hey, the new app looks pretty slick. The only problem is when I pull down to sync I used to be able to get the battery percentage from my charge 5. And now I can't find my battery percentage anywhere on the app anymore and with the small screen of the charge. 5. Reading the teeny little number can be difficult and impossible when you're not wearing your glasses. Can you please bring that back. It's very small but very important.",3.0
Christy Harris,Functional,"I'm on my second Fitbit. For one, since the last update, I keep getting a notification that it's not tracking my steps. Second, I miss the sleep sounds where it was just white noise and I also miss the ""hikes"" through the parks. Lastly, I have to say that for what we pay for the devices, we shouldn't have to pay extra to be able to access all the available features.",3.0
Bonnie Stavisky,Functional,"I have used Fitbit for 6-7 years. I have had many ""models"" from the basic to the Luxe. I do love the watches and enjoy all the tracking features. But....this new app should go back to the drawing board. Sync/info wait times were problematic as soon as the app was updated. I have followed all the trouble shooting suggestions. I restarted my phone, restarted my Luxe, turned Blue tooth on & off, deleted app, installed app but all I get is a ""server down"", ""try again"" message after signing in.",3.0
Andrea Root,Functional,"The latest update is awful. The look is horrible and feels like a complete downgrade from the previous version. I log time on a treadmill, and the newest way to log doesn't give me a way to log the distance, just time. If you were going to upgrade it, a way to add incline would have been an improvement. Clearly, very little user testing was done with this ""upgrade.""",3.0
Patrick Craig,Functional,"Ugh the newest update is not so great. I can't sync my phone to my watch. Fitbit what have you done? Shooting yourself in the foot doesn't look good on paper or in practice. Hope y'all fix this soon so I can give you back your stars. (OK they fixed my sync issue, still not big on the app so I made it 3 stars. Andres was real helpful. Thank him please.)",3.0
Amanda Mitchell,Functional,I've loved fitbit for all the things I can track but I hate the new redesign. Its so basic every aspect blends together with another and it takes me twice as long as it used to see where my tracking for any one thing is. Its not as visually pleasing or as easily readable as it used to be. It's still seems to track everything I want however this update still sucks!,3.0
Vicki Roberts,Functional,"The new update buried frequently used features that were visible on the main screen of the previous version. It now takes multiple clicks into the system menu to view small graphic and a vague status of high, medium, or low battery. Additionally the white background on the main screen now is harder to read and uses the phone battery faster than the darker screen did.",3.0
Robert Copeland,Functional,"Frustrating. This refreshed app is not nearly as useful as the previous version. I don't get the same notifications or can't see data for a specific workout. exercise details. The sync updates all see out of sync, sleep indicates no data, but I can see a score recorded if i tap it. Bring back the previous version.",3.0
Jennifer Tang,Functional,"Not liking the updated interface, too much empty space, so much harder to screenshot. Can't see more previous days' steps data when scroll down within the same page, only the past 7 days. Sucks because I want to see and screenshot my daily steps for the whole event or vacation, not separated by week, and can't do that. Also, the ""MobileTrack not tracking steps."" notification message won't go away like it used to before the update.",3.0
Eric Penner,Functional,"another update, more sync failures. it seems to be a pattern with this company. it loses my device every time the app is closed. uninstalled/reinstalled. it'll sync once and just get over it.. same as January 2018 update. Edit: October 2023 update has caused my device to quit syncing all over again. How does this happen so frequently? Once or twice I'd understand, but it has happened approximately a dozen times now. Supremely irritating.",3.0
cy bauer,Functional,"old app layout was better in some respects right off I wanted to know what the battery was on my watch, old app showed when syncing but this one doesn't and a person needs to go look for it. whe. you find it, it doesn't give the percentage of charge. i know, simply look at your watch, i just find it easier to do when I'm in the app doing other things",3.0
Rubylen Tipton-Butler,Functional,I loved the Fitbit app before the update. This new layout is not user friendly and I do not like how I have to click several places to get the information I am looking for. I wish there was an option to download the old layout because I do not like this new one. Also it has issues syncing and half the time I have to wait for it to get the updated info from my watch.,3.0
Kevin Moore,Functional,"I initially thought this app was stripped of features (map, splits, etc.) when updated as a means to push people towards purchasing fitbit premium. Upon learning that doesnt appear to be the case, hanlon's razor comes to mind: ""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."" This update is absolutely terrible. Addendum: It seems that they are listening. Maps, pace, and other features have been restored. Room for improvement. Rating changed.",3.0
Kevin Sanchez-Cherry,Functional,"It is good, but I don't like that it deletes data randomly. Other times it doesn't synch with other devices and I have to manually enter it. I tried those and it does not help. I am running Android 12 on my Samsung Galaxy. Just today I deleted an entry I put in last night because it didn't synch. Every entry for glucose readings last week deleted half if them so it only shows 1 reading per day instead if two.",3.0
Jen,Functional,"I am SO disappointed with this new interface! Why, oh why, do developers ""fix"" things that aren't broken?! I love my Fitbit, but the prior interface offered clarity, showed everything at a glance, and yet was still fully customizable. PLEASE either bring it back or give those of us less enchanted with the new ""modern style"" (read: giant space-taker) a chance to revert back to what we loved. Please!",3.0
Dawn Murph,Functional,"Since the last update I get an ongoing notification that the app is not tracking steps. I am constantly having to sync the app with my watch in order to have the watch function properly. I also have a red dot on my app, indicating a notification. However, when I open the app, nothing is there. I suspect the ""Not tracking steps"" notifications on my phone is related to this. The app is now more of an annoyance than a benefit.",3.0
Evans,Functional,I expect better from a device that cost 160$ plus whose premium features require a monthly membership and that is now owned by Google. It's supposed to detect workouts. For example I hopped on a bike. It self registered it as a sport. Can I change it to bicycle no. I did yoga for an hr. Did it register it; no. Same for a nap I took. I had to put it in myself. And my new charge 6 wouldn't work unless I updated my app to the Google version. Which in my opinion is cluttered and not streamlined.,3.0
Theresa Maher,Functional,"The update is awful. Not only from a design perspective and user interface, but it seems to be now buggy. For instance today there's no heartbeat at all, I've had issues with the sink It worked about six out of 10 times today. No matter how many times I've added water it does not reflect anything being added. I hope you didn't put a lot of money into this latest update because it kind of sucks.",3.0
Gene Jestice,Functional,"Started with the charge 2 in August and really love it! My sleep quality has improved and I've discovered that I walk 5 to 10 miles every day doing chores around the farm! UPDATE 9/29/23 changed my 5 star review to 3 stars for the new ""update"". So disappointed to wake up and see the sophisticated interface that I loved had been replaced by a drawing done by a kindergarten child. Also my battery level is no longer displayed when syncing so now I have to take the extra step to battery level.",3.0
Naomi Cahill,Functional,"New design is definitely not my favorite. I'm a runner, and I love being able to see my heart rate zones from my runs. Well with the new color scheme, they all look the same. Terrible ""upgrade"" from a design perspective. I haven't had any issues with it, but really not enjoying looking at my data anymore.",3.0
Kathryn L,Functional,"Doesn't always pick up my walks, and active minutes, but overall good. Update 2022: Walks and active minutes detection is now working very well. Update 9/29/23: I could live with the update, but I'm constantly getting a message that the app isn't tracking steps, which I can't get rid of. Very annoying.",3.0
Rebecca Kroes,Functional,I don't like the update it all looks the same. The foods for calorie tracking need major improvement. WW has way better scanning options and actually matches the nutritional facts labels on food. The ones in this app are horribly off a lot!!! Makes it difficult for someone trying to lose weight.,3.0
Liudmila Maksimovskaya,Functional,"The review is of the new UI only. It is not very user-friendly. Shouldn't there be some difference between different types of records? It looks a bit boring. Do you, guys, want people to use it less? ðŸ™‚ I'm curious to see what the testers say and why would testers find it inspiring and easy-to-use. I feel uninspired when looking at the UI",3.0
Mike Nelson,Functional,"I have used the Fitbit app now for at least 5+ years & it truly has the potential to be a 5* app. My biggest complaint comes from the food logging part. When you log good, stuff stays in your ""Recent"" tab forever. Items you add recently may or may not appear on the list and if they do, there's no rhyme or reasoning to where they get placed (top, bottom, middle, randomly placed). Recently used items you log should always stay at the top of the list, but this isn't the case. 5* if updated.",3.0
Mary Yunger,Functional,"I am most disappointed in the activity/exercise portion of the revised app. When I enter an activity/exercise, like the stationary bike, it no longer shows me the graph with the heartrate zones. Nor does it place the start time 30 min. before my end time. It doesn't even calculate calories like it says it will. It's just more cumbersome and way less informative.",3.0
Michael Whitehead,Functional,"The new UI is okay, although I think the previous version was more efficient and quicker to use. I AM missing the battery percentage on this new version, however. (It's so small and hard to read on the device itself.) When the app showed the percentage of battery power remaining, I knew if I had to charge it before I left to start my day, and it would last until I got home.",3.0
Jim Petrillo,Functional,"I generally like the app, but no dark mode is ridiculous at this point. (How does Fitbit promote sleep? Don't check their app at night!! ) Paying a high monthly premium for innate features is silly. Also I just realized one can't reorder the sequence of apps on a charge 5? Nor delete useless ones. The best feature of a Fitbit is that it's battery lasts a long time. (Not so with pixel watch) The reasons to choose one are fleeting at this point.",3.0
Candace Harper,Functional,"After about a year, the app quit automatically updating my watch. And yes, Bluetooth is turned on. The time gets behind (PROBLEM, cuz it's a WATCH), the weather won't come up, etc. Even when I manually tell it to sync and update, it won't do it half the time. I won't be replacing this. I'll go back to a reliable AND $10 watch. Thanks anyway.",3.0
D.P. Crane,Functional,App seems to work fine. I just have a problem with the food diary portion of the app. It would be helpful if the foods listed were all in alphabetical or some other sensible sort order. If you have quite a few foods in your diary it's really hard to find them if you've saved them or where the app lists them as frequent or recent entries. I'm also having trouble with sleep tracking part of the app. I have to adjust the time that the app inputs on it's own it always wrong.,3.0
Jasselle X,Functional,"I've been a Fitbit user for at least 7 years. The app still has so many glitches, and I've been using it less since challenges went away. Disappointing that it seems to be slowly getting worse instead of better. I also wish I could track my individual strength workouts in the app (manually), instead i have a separate app for that. Also the Fitbit premium workouts are so terribly organized and there is NO option to search through the exercises. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!",3.0
Brandy Boyd,Functional,"I've been having an issue that has lasted through both of the latest updates, whenever I change time zones, the food/calorie logging feature goes wonky. Doesn't matter if I'm going ahead or back, when I change time zones (or DST), the food logged after the time change is on the next day. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to correct the issue. Nothing else that fitbit support suggested worked. Otherwise, the app is solid.",3.0
f hackney,Functional,"My experience with Fitbit has been somewhat underwhelming. I believe it counts steps aggressively. I know within the app there are two different step counts shown with no apparent reasoning. The food log portion of the app is incomplete and the data it accumulates goes nowhere. So, what's the point? The zones and how the zones are determined is very confusing and not clearly defined. I'm using a pixel watch so maybe it's the hardware. If so if be surprised.",3.0
Debbie May,Functional,"I am once again trying to get my fitbit to work. Everytime I charge it there is a problem reconnecting to the app. The phone is telling me I need to have an app on my phone. Eventually, I can get it reconnected, but I need to play with it. Occasionally I will lose some functions such as sleep for a few days, and I miss some of the previous activities such as yoga and plates which evidently the programmers don't view as exercise.",3.0
Joan Patterson,Functional,"Operating system updated often but instructions are not so it's very hard to get relevant information. For example - the app used to tell me how many steps I took. Now it says how many calories I burned and I cannot change it back. Also, we traveled to Europe. I changed the time gong there but cannot correct it once we returned. I tried several times and was able to change the time - but not to the time where we live.",3.0
Michael Page,Functional,"It's ok. An earlier version of the app enabled setting the silent/vibrating alarm from the app. I cannot imagine what motivated the decision to remove that functionality, but I no longer use my fitbit fire an alarm. I would really like it if other forms of exercise were added to the tracker, as well. Edit: two years later, same two main issues - 1. you can't set the alarm from the app, you have to go into the tracker itself, and 2. It doesn't recognize enough forms of exercise.",3.0
Mandi Emineth,Functional,"Pros: Good for basic steps and exercise. Had it several years and the battery is still going strong. Cons: doesn't sync on its own. If I don't do it every day, some features don't work (find my phone, weather). I have an ad blocker on my phone and it blocks the watch face gallery, so I'm stuck with what I have.",3.0
Jordan Cox,Functional,"There is some sort of bug with the Stress Management feature. Each time the feature is attempted on the watch it says, ""Grant permissions in mobile app"" no matter how many times I do just that. And every time it's accessed on the app it runs through the introductory information as if it's the first time I've opened that menu. I cannot find any way to fix it.",3.0
Virginia K Cailleteau,Functional,"In the past month or two, my phone app and Sense watch have lost Bluetooth communication every day, sometimes many times a day. This has happened even when there are no other Bluetooth enabled devices nearby. Up to now I've really loved having a Fitbit, and enjoyed the features of the Sense, but the constant connectivity loss is EXTREMELY frustrating.",3.0
Carmen Byars,Functional,"Updating my review: I don't like the fact that they don't have the challenges anymore, and notifications for emails and text messages are random. Also, there's a 50/50 chance of my screen waking up when I turn my wrist even though I have always on display turned on. And the battery does not last as long as it used to.

It has been completely black for 2 years, but I wear it to track steps and sleep.",3.0
Jenni Dykstra,Functional,"This app is ok but has a bunch of wonky things that make it hard to use easily. Every chart should have a slider so you can see the date or time when, for example your sleep was restless. Logging a hike is really hard because you have to know the distance and exact time. It doesnt work if no internet. Workout charts show how much time since you started, but not time of day... which you really need to edit it (and you always need to edit it). Most premium features are gimmicky. It could be good.",3.0
Karen S,Functional,Something is not right with the app when attempting to manually add an exercise. Once the exercise is selected from the list it should go back to allow entry of time started and the length of time in the exercise but it continually snaps back to the screen where you enter the exercise. This is the android version on a Pixel 7. I have cleared the cache and reinstalled the app at least twice.,3.0
Jeffrey,Functional,"I'm conflicted. I love the detailed information in the app. However, now that the community aspect is gone, it's hard to feel motivated. I loved seeing others losing weight, building muscle, and collecting badges. This loss really changed my perspective of the app. You eliminated a major reason to use this app. I am on the fence now, so I'll give you 3 stars, nothing more.",3.0
Rebecca Cronk,Functional,"I LOVED using the Fitbit app for the past 2 years, especially the sleep data for my Charge 3. I believe issues have coincided with my use of the free 3 mo trial of Fitbit Premium, but am not positive. After rebooting the watch, restarting the phone, turning off/on Bluetooth, pairing ""new"" device (which shows up but doesn't completely pair), the watch will sync sometime in that next hour. If I'm lucky, it will sync one more time during the day. It's been like this for weeks.",3.0
Shawn Siler,Functional,"It's great except...the lack of gallery tiles for versa 4 can use a LOT of work. There are very few options for my Fitbit and it's a newer model. Every time I seen a tile I wanted, guess what, it didn't work for versa 4. I would've given 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of options to personalize my watch.",3.0
Jerry Sadler,Functional,"Food logging functionality could use some work. The ""Recent"" tab is very useful but it quickly gets too long and unmanageable because its items are not sorted in any particular order you end up scrolling through hundreds of items. It would be more useful if sorted chronologically or even better, the option of chronological or alphabetical. A search feature that searches exclusively this list would be a great feature as well.",3.0
Dan Cooke,Functional,"Upgrade to three stars from one, reluctantly. You can finally change the weight of a food without waiting two minutes. But it is clunky. I don't know if the new owners are serious about this, they just needed to tell shareholders they have watches now. Exercise measurement is okay - less options and not as user friendly as other options out there.",3.0
Jenna Speight,Functional,"It syncs well and it's got great analytics. However, the main reason I got a fitbit was to measure my calorie intake/output and the tracker seems to be broken. It always has like 1200 input cals charted for the following day (ex: it's wednesday, so it already says I'm ""over budget"" for thursday). Worse, sometimes it will say that I'm over budget by 500 cals for the current day, but when I add everything I've charted up, it's not matching up. Not great for someone who struggles with undereating.",3.0
Yvonne Walker,Functional,"The app is nice but it doesn't have all the functionality I would like. There are things that I do outside the app that I would like to include but can't add accurately like mediations I do or recipes I make. Also, for the nutrition part it would be nice to be able to adjust my micronutrients. Other than that it works for basics.",3.0
Patricia Barton,Functional,"Excellent App, easy to navigate. Now that I have been using for awhile, decided to change my rating. I walk for about an hour every morning. When I pick up the pace the app tells me I'm doing elliptical. I turned the elliptical feature off it only logged me as walking for 22 minutes. I don't like that when I tried to get tech support I either had to wait forever for calling or chat, or the other option was Twitter which I choose not to use. I guess I will have to turn the stupid elliptical on.",3.0
Raymond Carbonneau Robles,Functional,"Nice app in theory but has a lot of frustrating, unintuitive elements. I have to refresh the data often as it doesn't appear to pull from the wearable often enough. It tends to log my family members off, so I have to help them log on again. It also doesn't appear to speak directly to Google Fit, which is unsurprising how poor the ""integration"" is between Nest and Google Home.",3.0
Kimberly Hilliard,Functional,"It doesn't always give accurate data (ie. If you sit still, such as reading a book, it shows that you were asleep. Same way with the exercise data. I was running a tractor for several hours and it showed that I was bicycling. To receive more than basic data, you have to pay a monthly premium. Also the plastic band causes my skin to peel where it touches.",3.0
Marcia Grossman,Functional,"Very accurate step counter. Important for me. However, the Fitbit platform appears to be unstable. Often won't sync, and app needs to be reinstalled. A time-wasting nuisance. NEGATIVE: can't even get the Dashboard on my new computer. App says for ALL devices, but clearly not for PC's.",3.0
Brian Call,Functional,Most of the content in the app is loaded on the fly via a network connection so it's slow or unusable when you have a weak or non existent connection. The body metric graphs are easy to understand and I love that trend data is available without having to log in elsewhere.,3.0
Greta Blake,Functional,"The new update is poor! I can't reorganize the sections based on the stats I follow most, having to scroll up and down is very annoying! There's no battery % anymore. Bring back these features, please! There is one improved thing, when you're searching for a workout you can sort by category, therefore making it easier to find what you're looking for. I still miss the fitbit coach that used to give ready follow on workouts without having to search and make your own plan.",3.0
Amateur Warden,Functional,"Yeah the new look sucks I liked it better before. I like the app functions, but the new update made everything look the same, all white and purple? Like, why?

mich ael,Functional,"The app works well, but there's a lot of features to be desired, that people are asking for, that are ignored. An example would be, daily resets based on sleep time instead of midnight, blood oxygen levels during hours that aren't sleep, real time variable spo2, etc. There are more than 1000 people working at Fitbit, and they can't change the daily reset from sleep after more than a thousand people voted for it since 2015? That is a simple change and they can't do it after 8 years? Really?",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The current app has created a lot of problems, so many previous versions were good but the latest update created a lot of data collection issues which needed a lot of Bluetooth restarts.

Paul Michaelsen,Functional,Pixel 7 Watch is the worse electronic device I ever owned. Now going in my sixth replacement for the back cover falling off. Asked Verizon for a refund after 3rd time. They refused because it was more than thirty days since my purchase. Watch has a one year warranty. Contacted Google. They won't refund me because I didn't purchase the watch through them.

Tracy Doeppers,Functional,"Works well for tracking steps & weight. But the sleep tracking is truly frustrating. At least 1-2/wk, it doesn't track sleep, so i have no metrics. I'm not doing anything different, so there's no good reason for this. It also has trouble detecting when sleep starts, & I have to edit at least once/wk. And when I do try to edit, it sometimes gives me an error, or won't let me update. With a company like Fitbit, persistent bugs like this are unacceptible!",3.0
Unknown Lundgren,Functional,I've had my Versa 3 for about two years now and I have loved it. It keeps track of my sleep and heart rate plus reminds me to take meds.

Deniece H.,Functional,"I can't mirror videos and workouts to my tv. It keeps telling me to make sure tv is on same wifi as phone. I did a network reset on my tv.

I have to touch the battery icon in the app to see an icon for battery and guess how much charge is left! Another bad move! Also on my charge 5 watch for my old dad, there is no display of year.

Norm Bryan,Functional,"The update is suboptimal; that is, it is less developed than what it replaced. It no longer tracks pulse rate nor the resting rate thus losing for me an important function. Update Thank you, Fitbit, for the response but it does not address the app, rather it addresses the fitbit device. The device tracks pulse; the app which syncs to the device does not, nor does it provide such as an option. In my regard, the update is less functional than before, however such may not be an issue for others.",3.0

Kids Life,Functional,"The new app look is beautiful, but so many things have changed. I no longer know how to change the watch face on my kid's Ace 3, I can't see my child's steps or heart rate, and it doesn't have the best customisation. Things that used to be good are now either no longer there or not as good. Please fix these things and make it easier to use. It would make life much easier! Also, in the pictures and video of the app it has steps & heart rate - except I can't find where I can see steps/heart? Lies!",3.0
Christopher Hudson,Functional,"The app does a lot of things well, like the exercise tracking. It's nice to have the built in calorie counter.

Also having to pay a monthly subscription is a real bummer.",3.0
Leslie Neely,Functional,"Edit 10/2023: do not love the new look. Too much white space, and all the stats have the same color which makes it harder to find what I'm looking for. I keep having problems with it failing to sync. First review: I use the basic, non-Premium version with a Versa Lite. Edit: update problem with oxygen saturation seems to be fixed. I use this to track my water, sleep, and steps. Works well. I also often use the timer, alarms, and weather features. Very useful!",4.0
Ken Brennan,Functional,"I believe I have found a software bug. The sleep tracker is off by an hour. For example, I go to bed at 10pm but the tracker shows 11pm. The total hours are correct, it's just shifted an hour ahead. My timezone is correct. I can provide more information if needed. Follow up: I have received the article and it doesn't help. I have tried many changes to correct this. The problem still exists.",4.0
O'Shea Quigley,Functional,Fitbit is a good app for fitness tracking but lately after the recent update it has been having problems syncing. I thought it was a problem with my Fitbit versa three so I did a factory reset on it. The only way I managed to set it up was through Bluetooth and it took over 2 hours. I got it working and it has a better time syncing. (Edit) They fixed the problem so it is good,4.0
Vivian Schultz,Functional,"Pretty much whst I needed to track my health. Lots of great ideas and challenges. Not thrilled with the update. Lost some customization and some areas like blood glucose no longer are on the dashboard. You have to open the area yo see your readings. I've also found that it doesn't always track accurately some things. For example: I will workout for an hour and get credit for 30 minutes. Or I'll go to bed at 9PM know I fell asleep around 930 , but the app doesn't track any sleep until midnight.",4.0
Abby M,Functional,"Edit (10/13): I think the app update helped as it seems to be working much better since. The new features are fairly interesting. I currently have an Inspire2 and this was great for a long time, but recently I haven't been able to sync (which makes me glad I haven't started a new StepBet yet). I thought maybe it was my phone, but upon seeing others having similar issues, I doubt it. These watches and trackers are too expensive not to work! Seems more like a money grab than caring about health.",4.0
Mike Nemetz,Functional,App/watch is good for the most part. Shows most of the health details I'm looking for and keeps me motivated. Love the handy reminder to get moving every hour and the sleepntracker to see how my sleep went? They recently changed the screen design to a white/green background. Too bland. Liked the old screen better. In my 7th year using it.,4.0
Meghan Boni,Functional,"Not for nothing.... everything was fine until you did something with the latest update. I cannot get any of my notifications and my ispire 2 doesn't vibe for notifications....I've checked all my settings and nothing has changed as well as also restarted it a few times as well as paired it again to my phone. So, I'd look into it. Thanks.",4.0
Baldero Mendoza,Functional,"I love this app! I use it all the time, constantly. It is crucial for tracking my afib - I can see the episodes, the duration, the intensity , daily, weekly, etc. I can track my exercise and so much more. It's just amazing! The only flaw, to me, is the sleep feature. I realize I have sleep apnea, but good grief! If it were up to Fitbit I'd be in bed 22 hrs a day. Luckily the sleep feature can largely be done manually, so that handles that issue. Also, I continually have issues with syncing.",4.0
Tammy Walston,Functional,"I use the app to track my activity -steps, stairs, etc and to track and work on improving my sleep. It's user-friendly and has functions I've not explored yet. Update 2023: The app has been updated, and the interface is completely different. I don't love it. It went from easy to see my info with a quick scroll to having to scroll up and down trying to find what I'm looking for plus a lot of taps. I may get used to it, but I don't like it. Thus, the downgraded rating.",4.0
Antonio Balboa,Functional,"It's a mostly fantastic app. I love the new interface, but I had only been using the previous interface for a couple months. I love the tracking of just about everything and how it shows you your trends. My primary gripe is that runs on treadmills show very limited data. No splits for my treadmill runs is a bit annoying. I hope they can address this soon. The other two pretty popular health tracking apps both give lots of detail in treadmill runs.",4.0
Noelle Campagna,Functional,"Not loving parts of the new update - the large amounts of white space and the same colored icons make it hard to easily find what I'm looking for. The heart rate zone colors have also been heavily muted, making it harder to see at a glance where my heart rate was during my workouts. Besides that, the app is super helpful and easy to use. I do like the progress bars and percentages that came with new updates, as well as the more refined coaching tab",4.0
Meredith Razen,Functional,"Pretty user friendly - I particularly find the food tracking section to be far better than any others I have tried, however, I wish that I could input the actual time that I ate something, rather than having to use one of the predetermined categories, and I really wish that it showed the carbohydrate count for each item entered, as it does for calories, rather than just the total carbs at the top... They're assuming I can handle that math, but sometimes I can't... Lol!",4.0
Robert eddleman,Functional,"Great app. I have a Versa 3. GPS function could be more apparent. Haven't located it yet. I love the sleep tracker feature. Let's me know if I toss and turn alot.update: 10-12-23. So they did an update to this app. In doing so,they took away the battery percentage and went with a battery image. And I had to figure it out. The location that is. Personally, I like the older version better. But this is just my opinion. Please put the battery percentage back!!!",4.0
Apryl Dunlap,Functional,"I love Fitbit, I've owned many. They just keep getting better. I would love to see a place to keep body measurements, a daily Journaling option, and a place to log daily meds and supplements as those are things I monitor already and I have to use separate apps to do it. They are all part of my health journey and to have it all in one place would be amazing.",4.0
Nicole Pastore,Functional,"I really like this app. I think it has a great database of foods. I like that I can create a custom food for recipes that I make.

I've rebooted my phone without any resolution. Very disappointed in this glitch.",4.0
GoBird Dawg,Functional,"Overall, it's quite good. Shortcomings are the heart rate monitor accuracy (often reads high to very high during exercise) and calories burned I believe is too high as well. I also don't like to be pushed towards premium subscription. I already bought the device, I shouldn't be badgered for a monthly service I don't feel I need. That said, there are more positives than negatives and I use the devic and app all of the time. Gives me a general idea of exercise levels and overall health.",4.0
Stephen Maus,Functional,"Overall it's a solid app, but I do not like the aesthetic of this latest update. It is just...bland. Itâ€™s also not as intuitive - the previous setup seemed more user-friendly. It would be great if there were different options for the appearance and organization of the app - that way users could get it exactly the way they want.",4.0
Jason Llewellyn,Functional,"I like the refresh of the app. It's a lot more precise in where the information is, how the user can read it, and it's less cluttered.

Lisa Bello,Functional,"Update 2023-10-12: Still love my Fitbit app, but the recent update hiccups and yesterday's outage certainly sent me for a loop. I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling the app, lost half of yesterday's data, and was just annoyed. But if that is the worst of it, I am still pretty happy with the app and watch. Of course, I have no other experience with fit trackers with which to compare, but the minor annoyance is worth it to have Ros the Diva workouts.",4.0
Carol J. Burton,Functional,"Just bought an inspire 3 yesterday and so far I love it. But, the bracelet won't vibrate for texts. I have done all troubleshooting. Wondering if this tracker isn't compatible with Chomp SMS app which is my default message app. Thanks. Edit/Update...LOL, I'm not sure what I did to make this work now. Changed a setting in the Chomp SMS app and restarted the tracker, but it worked! Getting vibration for texts now.",4.0
wes bell,Functional,The latest changes to the app address mixed. While the sync with the mobile seems more stable...a removal of battery level from the app is a step in the wrong direction. The fitness band screen is small and trying to read the battery level is impossible but you could always get the info from the app. No longer,4.0
Lisa Wolgast,Functional,"Do not like the newest update. They removed the battery charge level from the main page of the app. I can't find where the app tells the percentage of my watch battery. Also some of the pages are changed & some are in the old format. It's very confusing. I would rather have the older, more cohesive version",4.0
Pam McStay,Functional,"I really like this app. That said, the new updates released in the past week are graphically disappointing. I liked the layout and colors before. This version is dry and boring. It is also annoying that the menu flipped around in order (is water came before food, now it's after).",4.0
Dan Lakeman,Functional,"Pretty pleased with the app, wish it didn't require to be connected to the internet just to see anything though. Occasionally there's a glitch where it says ""connected to GPS"" when GPS is off and not even in an exercise mode, but since the last update just rebooting the phone fixes it. 'Find Phone' feature actually works really well.",4.0
Ben Perkins,Functional,"Have absolutely loved being in the Fitbit community since November 2022 and I really enjoy the available features. The celebratory moments, easy goal setting, water tracking, zone minutes, and really deep sleep data have been SO enjoyable for me to have access to! It makes me feel so happy to see a much more holistic view of my health and so much data. The main issues: some of the app UI feels outdated, the chat support is neat but often buggy, the AOD feature doesn't always work with my watch.",4.0
Kiara Littlejohn,Functional,"This app has been super helpful in my fitness journey (down 30 lbs!), but it could use some improvements. The menstrual tracker is NOT easy to use...it's basically nonfunctional. The calorie tracker is fine, but the catalog of available foods could be better. The other functions (water tracker, sleep tracker, exercise tracker, heart rate monitor) work really well.",4.0
Betty Adams,Functional,"The Charge 4 has been a great tracker for me. Steps, sleep, goals, and vitals are basically what I have used it for. There was a period when I was not able to wear it, and when I came back, it seemed like some options had been moved over to the premium subscription. That was disappointing. And I really do miss the challenges. Technically, the tracker has been working great, I've had it for several years and only had to replace the wrist band recently.",4.0
Beth Williams,Functional,"Overall, it's pretty good! I'm suscribed to the paid version, and there's definitely a lot of great features, like workouts, tracking capabilities, recipes, and more. A few things I'd love to see: For the recipes, offer a downloadable or at least typed out version instead of only a video. The ""Frequent"" and ""Recent"" lists for food tracking need improvement. At the top of these lists, it shows me foods that I only tracked a few times, whereas foods I track every day are nowhere near the top.",4.0
Lisa Fronczek,Functional,"This app is relatively easy to use. Nice dashboard view for the days. My only complaint is that I'd like it to be a bit easier to remember how to force my fitbit to adjust to the current time zone when I'm traveling. For some reason, my fitbit doesn't always switch even though I have the setting to adjust set to auto.",4.0
Paul Moser,Functional,"Overall good app. Works consistently and smoothly. Some additional features would be beneficial. I would love to be able to build and save meal ""assemblies"" instead of having to add each individual ingredient over and over. Access to more raw data would help as well. The data is already there, I just want to be able to see it.",4.0
Windy Burner,Functional,"This is a very useful app. Except it doesn't stay connected, and then you'll have no readings at all, or it will duplicate your last readings for however long it was not connected to your wrist. Even when the watch is snug. This is still accurs. I must say that when it works, it does work! I matched my numbers on the fitbit up with the doctors. All the numbers were very close.

DameDeb,Functional,"My experience with my Fitbit tracker and this app have been just good. Having trouble with my Inspire 2 not recording my sleep, that is the tracker's issue.

C. L. R.,Functional,"I've used Fitbits for years-3 different ones! I like them, but they have occasional hiccups with tracking here and there. Usually they come up with an update and it helps. But, I do wish they would make the food tracking easier! So frustrating to not be to select to put foods alphabetically on the app or delete foods you don't eat anymore. Scrolling down to find a food is time consuming. Even on the site it isn't easy to delete things- only if they're custom- where you add them yourself.",4.0
Lydia Glider-Shelley,Functional,"I'm pretty happy with the device. However, could you PLEASE program it so that the voice prompt lets us know if/when the GPS is lost, so we can stop and reconnect, for a more accurate representation of our routes? Also, having the pulse oximetry measured at night is good, but it would be wonderful to see a graph detailing ups and downs in our O2 and what time the lows occur. I'd also like my fitbit to vibrate or make a sound to wake me up if my pulse ox falls too low. (Below 90)",4.0
Nancy Cochran,Functional,"There are several features that I use daily and like quite well. It's easy to record meals, particularly if you use the ""frequent"" or ""recent"" tab.

Overall, a great app.",4.0
Jim â€œYogiâ€,Functional,"I think it's strange. It does do the job, but it is not intuitive. It also seems to emphasize Napping - down-time. Huh? Tell me the step count! It's also very slow, but never tell you that. Example: you click on a task, and it just freezes. No feedback (like a progress bar) that it's still alive doing anything. Reminds me of old software of the 1990s. Then, after it does update, some step counts shown don't match. It needs to be cleaned up. Yogi Schaffner Sr Design Elect Engr Long Beach, CA",4.0
Lindy Hoppough,Functional,"It was better when I started. Since then, they added some useless info to the top of the sleep section that I have to scroll past to get to the good info, and I can no longer zoom in on heart rate data. In fairness, I'm probably an outlier because I'm more interested in the health metrics than the fitness. The daily ""inspirational"" msgs are something else I have to scroll past. I really like the sleep breakdown though. I think it's a premium feature.",4.0
Una Whitfield,Functional,I have been a loyal user since a Versa 2 was given to me as a gift. I experienced syncing problems prior to my anniversary date. I was given a replacement. Which I received in May. Now this device is doing the same and more such as not syncing and now not registering and not charging. Now they are saying the device is out of warranty. How? When the replacement device isn't even a year old. I am done. Fitbit can go jump in the lake. It isn't a reliable device and the Versa2 isn't.,4.0
Beverly Lewis,Functional,"Generally speaking, it does keep track of steps, heart rate, distance, and sleep. However to get other information, one has to subscribe to Premium for 9.99 per month. I had it for a year, but really it didn't seem worth the money. I am not crazy about this fitness tracker. I have the Inspire 2, and you can choose exercises like running, swimming, weight lifting, treadmill, or HIIT. But sometimes I do yoga or other exercises. No way to register that.",4.0
Jessie Herr,Functional,"One thing that I'd really like to see, is a revamp on the food logging, such as being able to manually save favorite foods for easier tracking- instead of trying to scroll through lists looking for it or typing/searching for it. Also, more stuff added to the database, like the stuff I've submitted months ago to be added, aren't in there yet. The nutrition facts & macros can be off at times too",4.0
Alicia Milton,Functional,"I like using Fitbit among several of the other smart watches. It's kept track of my steps, most accurate connecting to my text messages and time, and is simple to use.

David Eubanks,Functional,"I love this app it meets all my wants and needs. However, sometimes it is frustrating to get sync through out the day, and I have lost information from the Fitbit to the app. Like I said, I love it! Although there has been a lot of improvement, I still am having trouble getting it to pick up my activities, and if I manually add it, it doubles the activity. This doesn't happen that often I am still loving it!",4.0
Key Martin,Functional,"I didn't realize just how much I was walking at work until I looked at this app. Surprised that I'm averaging over 20,000 steps. Anyway, easy to see on the app and information syncs from the watch easily. No problems when watch is out of range of my phone; it'll just sync up when in range again. Not sure how it decides I'm walking up stairs, since I don't remember doing that, which is why I didn't give it a 5-star.",4.0
Greg,Functional,Not the easiest to figure out but seems to keep accurate records. Some things are a bit over my head and other things I just quit trying to figure out or understand but I have lost 75 lbs over the past 2 years & much of it while using this app and the versa 2 watch my so n got for me.

AnneMarie Grunberg,Functional,Fitbit is overall good but has two issues: one major and one an annoyance. The major issue is the design of the charger. After a couple months a contact breaks and no longer charges the watch. I am now on my fifth charger this year. The minor annoyance is the syncing is temperamental but there are work-atounds. Overall the watch works well and functions as advertised. I especially find the sleep health metrics useful. The app is well designed. App customer service is awesome!,4.0
Kael Jensen,Functional,"I really like the Fitbit app. I signed up for the premium version beginning of February and it's been extremely helpful. I wish there was something one could indicate if one has a chronic health condition, however, as that will affect ability to be more or less active. Also, this morning for some unknown reason, I was completely signed out of my entire Fitbit app and it's asking me to re-sign up for Fitbit altogether with Google. Anyone else have this issue?",4.0
Mike Freeman,Functional,"Solid Info, Easy to Use. Sync can be janky. The app presents daily activity and workouts in pleasant format. Sleep tracking is a plus. But the best sleep data is paywalled. Not unusual these days, but still not great for the user. The sync with my Pixel watch is just barely adequate. Takes a good 20 mins in morning for sleep data to push up to the app. Sometimes I still have to directly open the app on the watch to for the phone app to sync. For two Google products, should be better.",4.0
Cindy Guevara,Functional,"I am addicted to my Fitbit and the app. It's had issues over the years but when it works it's completely indispensable! I love all the data it provides and the help with the extras like timers, linking to Alexa, and all my other apps. Seriously, I love it.

Kim Hall,Functional,New Pixel 8 Pro and 6 months of premium for free however the app is horrible. Half of the features do not load on the phone and several will cause the app to crash when selecting.

Updated: Fast response from the support team and they provided steps to resolve my issues. All features appear to be working now.,4.0
Dian Sesma,Functional,"I have a fitbit charge 5. The app is pretty general and easy to use. I'm disappointed in the clock face options. They aren't very creative or colorful. Would be nice to be able to create my own. Another part of the app that needs improvement is the food logging. You can't delete items that are no longer needed, and it keeps multiples of the same food items on the logger list. Which makes it a waste of space and time looking for a particular item. Same title items should become 1.",4.0
Cara Carlson,Functional,"I have been using this app and Fitbit devices since 2015, and I agree that they are very user-friendly. However, these are the things I have noticed could improve this app: The menstrual tracking needs to be more customizable and allow you to input your own symptoms. Meditations need to be able to be manually entered, the mediations available in the app are short, and there aren't very many. Also, watches need to stop counting steps while in a biking workout. It's double counting activity.",4.0
Dan Traina,Functional,"After having some issues with instabilities within the app I reinstalled. This fixed the instability issues, I should have thought of this myself. App looks good and I look forward to exploring it more. Is there a good, quick way to stop tracking steps while I use my riding lawnmower. I would really rather not trick it with starting a false activity and then deleting it. This is a very real issue with fitness trackers. Simply a pause step counting option would be great. Thanks",4.0
mizCD 1,Functional,"I've had the Inspire 2 for about 8 months now. I've enjoyed using this app for the step counter, sleep tracker, and food tracker. I'm not sure how accurate the pedometer is, but the fact that I can set a reminder to move helps me out significantly at work all day. In addition, I find sometimes when you scan the barcoodes for food items the codes don't always correspond to the correct food, or if companies have updated the calorie count, the fitbit database doesn't have the updated count.",4.0
Antau L'Jn,Functional,"I was gifted an Inspire 3 watch (I had sworn never to do Fitbit again because syncing was a horrible nightmare).

I will maintain my 4 stars rating, however, because the tracking water feature does not record accurately or sometimes not at all. If this aggravation is fixed, I would cheerfully give Fitbit 5 stars. It does a good job of helping me stay on track with exercise, proper diet and a generally healthy lifestyle. I also like the additional features, such as meditation, sleep guides, and exercise videos.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app itself is fine. The dashboard is lightly customizable and you can turn various functions on and off. I use a fitbit for step tracking and that's about it, really, so the app and hardware do what I need it to do. However, some more customization options in the dashboard and a more stable syncing process would be nice. Additionally, not a huge fan of having to turn my location on to get a sync on my fitbit 2. That seems like a bit of a stretch to me. In any case, the app works fine for what I need it for. Those who need something hardcore may be disappointed though.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,I really enjoy this. Lots of features on the app. I've put off getting a Fitbit for a while. The Ionic is fantastic and the battery life is great. As for the app. It's a little ridiculous that you have to use software on a desktop to download songs onto the watch. I have a chromebook which makes this next to impossible. Incorporating a way to move song files via the bluetooth connection and the phone app would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Fitbit,4.0
Nicole Zimmers,Functional,"The past few weeks the app is very sporadic with syncing. And over the past three days, I can't get it to sync at all. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, I've unpaired and re-paired my Versa2. It just spins and gives an error that it can't sync. 1/29/22 - Update: increasing rating up from one star. The syncing issues seems to have been resolved and everything is working well",4.0
Brianna Erickson,Functional,"It's a pretty good app but one improvement would be w/some of the premium features. Specifically, the work out videos section. There is no way to search for specific workouts or types. The only options are little filters at the top that have limited choices. It would be nice to be able to search for specific instructors, types (mobility, core, legs, etc.), length, etc. Having this in the favorites area would be great as well. I also wish it indicated which workouts you've already completed.",4.0
Elona Mollon,Functional,"upgraded HR 3 to 4 for better sleep apps. I do like the extras on the app. issues: too many notifications. I only want ones related to fitbit but keep keeping so much more. The buzz on the wrist cannot be effective with all that action. Then the vibrations keep getting turned off because it automatically goes into do not disturb mode. The screen dims automatically so I cannot read it! I don't know if this is the app or the device, but it is very frustrating. Rating would be 5 otherwise.",4.0
Alex,Functional,"I love this watch! It's doing it's job keeping me fit and drawing awareness to my health goals. I experienced a lot of connectivity issues at the beginning. It wasn't updating or syncing with my phone. Out of the box phone notifications didn't seem to be on by default. I figured as soon as I connected my phone I'd be able to see my text, emails, calendar, etc. But, it wasn't, I had to dig into the menus and enable notifications. I also think it's strange that the app store access is in a menu.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Update after several improvements to the app: it syncs faster and takes less steps to initiate. Since I only use it for Alarms, Sleep and Steps, I can't comment on other features. Messages no longer sync to my Fitbit, but I'm not sure it is the fault of the app or the device. Original comments: Does all I need it to do. Sleep stats are very interesting. But, Blaze is slow to sync. Dashboard is too basic. I'd like to be able to switch to something s bit more professional appearing.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's a pretty good app for what it is. Theres a few bugs here and there when it come to tracking water and sleep, but other than that it's overall quality. My only thing is that food tracking is kind of tedious. It would be convenient if I could create a list of my frequent foods, or even a favorite foods list so it's easier to pick out instead of having to always scan a barcode or search.",4.0
Sarah Burch,Functional,"Only because I don't use all it's capabilities. But it definitely helped me stay on track with my weight loss. I was able to lose 30 lb in a year. UPDATE: upgraded to Inspire2 and getting more data and useful info. Still not using all capabilities, but there is so much goal tracking available surely everyone can kind something to help on their path.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've had 2 Fitbits, the original basic model and now an Alta HR. I switched up because arthritis in my hands made it very hard to squeeze the band closed on the first one. While I like them both, I find the HR more persnickety about syncing with devices. I never know from one day to the next if it will sync easily or will I have to restart the device, sometimes more than once, before it will sync. This has not improved with the new app version, by the way.",4.0
Dennis Heinle,Functional,"This app has been pretty solid for me after switching to a Pixel 6/Fitbit Sense. The sleep, water and exercise tracking are great. However, the food tracking is terrible. The database is bloated with a bunch of duplicate or out-of-date information, you have to add things one-at-a-time, the search is bad and rarely finds anything even in the ballpark of what I look for and you can't create recipes in app and if you use the web site to track anything, it'll often break the sync for that thing.",4.0
Jalisa Johnson,Functional,"Overall, a pretty good app to be paired with my device. Other than the bugs I experience here and there, I don't have any serious complaints. But I do have a suggestion. I experience periods, and i use the tracker, but i wish there was an option to exclude certain cycles that are out of the ordinary from my data so that I can get a better reading of my average cycles. It would make everything so much easier to read.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Very nice UI. Does not always cooperate, especially with more tasking things using your device's GPS to track distance on a non-gps watch. Also has a poor settings / error message response system. Those complaints aside, it is pretty stable, and has many excellent features: from goal setting, to exercise and sleep tracking, to food and water intake logs, and more.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Generally, it's a great app. There are a few things that I wish were changed. I wish you could see heart rate zones while exercising and I wish you could fix the distance as it does not track accurately most of the time while exercising on machines. 6 miles on the flexstride equals 1.3 miles on my Fitbit. I also wish you could set up food combinations so you don't have to find all the ingredients every time you have that meal.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,Overall I really love this app and my charge 3 Fitbit. It is great at auto tracking workouts that involve running or walking. It accurately tracks the distance and heart rate during both of those exercises. The one feature I really wish it had was the ability to track cycling workouts. You can put them in retrospectively but it won't track heart rate during your workout (which is pretty important to me).,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I actually love my Fitbit, but the newest update on May 10th has messed with my stats.  The watch is collecting the data correctly, and the app agrees with the watch, except the app is not telling me all of the exercises, under the exercise option.  I generally do two workouts a day, and it is only crediting one.  Now not really a big deal, since it is there in steps, and time, but I use that section to help me identify how hard I am working out.  Ideas?",4.0
Selahndra Mathew,Functional,Overall good. It's hard to find where to change things if it's not setup how you want. Trouble shooting issues isn't too hard though. The lamest part is when I updated to version 32.72.1.23. It tells me EVERY TIME I open the app to set up phone notifications: I DON'T WANT TO because I HATE notifications. I tried to trick it by turning them on and then turning them off but that didn't work. Make it stop!!!!!,4.0
Jeanette Pelletier,Functional,UPDATE: 20 Jul 2022 - It is back to working again. I wish it would stay that way. It tends to have hiccups with the app.. OLD REVIEW: I haven't been able to sync up my versa with my computer or my phone since Sept 1. Since then it keeps saying needs to be synced. I removed the app and unpaired and re-added but still doesn't work. I really am not happy. I've just seen all the reviews and notice I am not the only one with issues. They need to fix this issue.,4.0
Eric Fisher,Functional,"Generally good. Handy that it can connect/sync with third party wellness platforms; allows you share as much or as little as you wish. Navigation and access to some features & settings are difficult to find or recall if you're not constantly dug in all the time. I mean that's just me, what do I know? ;)",4.0
Madison Demshar,Functional,"There are a couple small issues, such as my watch not syncing even after trying multiple times then restarting my phone and the watch, but otherwise, good app. I wish the premium service didn't cost as much, but I'm not that invested I'm fitness. I like that you can log so many different things, such as mood, water, food, exercise, and your period. With some improvements, the app and premium service could be amazing.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's great when it works. Specifically, the sync feature can be really finicky. Overall the latest design is great and it's pretty straightforward to use. I wish the challenges were more real time, and it would be nice if there was a way to prevent challengers from sandbagging by disabling sync or Bluetooth until the end.",4.0
Leighanna Sears,Functional,"Overall, the app is great but in recent months it has been very buggy. Everytime I first open the app it says I have some stupid amount of steps, like literally 100,000 plus, along with other wrong/craxyy stats, and I have to refresh it to get rid of that. Other than that, the app is great and I like all of the features available. I haven't signed up for their subscription service, but it is tempting.",4.0
deskby the teacher,Functional,All of a sudden....it stopped syncing. The time won't set correct. One hour it was the 22nd then it was 23rd IN THE SAME DAY!! WHAT HAPPENED? looks like I'll be looking for a new watchâ˜¹ï¸,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"In response to their response. I did every one of these things ""fixes"" multiple times and have contacted support and still no fix. Overall this is a great app, what keeps me from giving it five stars is the fact that it has a bug that has not been fixed. When logging your meals, the app has a tendency to change your amounts to your previous amounts that you entered in the past. It can be quite frustrating especially if you don't notice it happening. If they fixed this, it would be a solid app.",4.0
Gregg Arpin,Functional,"Decent app. Tracks steps, workouts, runs and even meals. Keeps historical records of everything so you can monitor progress. My only complaint is that you can't combine foods into meals. So, for example, when I go to chipotle, I have to enter 1 serving of flour tortilla, 1 serving of brown rice, 1 serving of black beans, etc. instead of being able to just define a custom burrito once and reuse it.",4.0
Catherine Reichert,Functional,"Update: watch synchs with phone now but no longer alerts for calls and messages. Since update I have not been able to sync phone and watch. This has been a great app.until now. I have worn a fitbit for 4 years. My versa now acts like it has lost its mind. Since the app is required for set up and keeping history, my versa is useless except for counting steps. It will still do that. It won't sync with phone or tablet or daughters phone. Fitbit is a great product.",4.0
Karen Logeman,Functional,"Could use a few tweaks, specifically in the female health tracker, but I like the many features it does have. I've had no issues with the app working properly, other than the Dashboard doesn't update well with the data you've entered. The data is there in the fields but often not displayed on the Dashboard. I love that I can link it to both my LoseIt! app and my Dexcom app.",4.0
Charles Bosse,Functional,"The app is pretty good, although the interface can be circuitous. It's also sad that Fitbit Pay isn't just Google pay, (since Google owns fitbit, this should be the easiest change) and means I have to start over with wishing my bank supported a tap-and-pay platform. Once you get around the initial learning curve of figuring out how to do things like search for foods, it's got a lot of options and only a few failure modes.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love almost everything about the Fitbit. The only complaint is that it credits me for flights of stairs & steps while I'm driving my work vehicle daily. I have to go into the app & manually enter ""driving"" as an ""exercise"" multiple times a day. It's so time consuming & frustrating. Other than that, it's a wonderful device!!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I only give it 4 stars because my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 does not always sync with my Charge 2. Now it doesn't sync at all. However, the iPad Air 2 works fine but I don't always have it on my person. I tried all the things suggested by multiple sources and it works sometimes. Because of the cloud, when I sync with the iPad when the phone won't sync I can then see the results on my phone.",4.0
Raymond Lulling,Functional,"Overall I have been reasonably pleased with this application and the functions of the Fitbit itself . However two of my biggest complaints. The Fitbit can't seem to tell the difference between wrist motion and walking, so I may easily rack up thousands of steps, doing assembly work at a desk. And the other issue is that O2 data is only available when a person is sleeping. And this is very frustrating because I would like to see real-time O2 data if possible.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"*** Update... It's working again. It took a few days, but it started syncing again.Thanks for the reply and for fixing whatever was wrong! It's back to working great. :) Like many others, I loved this app. The last update made it so my phone won't sync to it. Yes, I have restarted it, factory reset it, and reinstalled the app. If u look at the comments, this is happening to a lot of people and not just me. Please fix it.",4.0
JT,Functional,"Overall, I'm satisfied with the app. The food log could be a bit more intuitive. Give me the option to create custom meals I frequently eat (e.g. mayo, tuna, relish, pita bread, etc. combined as one meal). Instead of manually adding each individual component, I can just click the 'Custom Meal' I've already saved. Hate to compare, but My Fitness Pal does this best. Also, some of the premium features aren't all that helpful. Meal videos, for example, should have a link to the written recipe.",4.0
Jaclyn Jensen,Functional,"I am a long time user of fitbit watches. In general the app has been fine and the upgrades tend to be good, but I think what is missing from the calorie tracking is a way to quickly input BOTH calories and macronutrients. When estimating a full, homemade meal, it is way easier to calculate everything and then input the calories and macros rather than input every food item and portion one by one into the app. I do not like that the Quick Input option only allows to add calories.",4.0
Michelle Fischer Blank,Functional,"Great app overall. I am honestly very surprised by all of the bad reviews. I've had FitBit for 5 years now and hardly have any issues. Whenever something does go wrong, it seems to get fixed fairly quickly. My only issue as of the latest update is that the GPS isn't working all of a sudden. It will track for .1 miles and then stop. The rest of the workout tracks fine though. No syncing issues at all. I do wish the food tracking was better, especially when it comes to creating meals.",4.0
DoctorProfessor Wilson,Functional,"The period tracker is HORRIBLE. The sliding bar method is incredibly bad. Please just let me put my start date in without the stupid sliding bar that doesn't work, it always keeps the end of the period at the same date and won't let it be shortened. Maybe try a similar method to Samsung health it's way easier to use. Everything else is pretty decent",4.0
Iona Lacson-Dy,Functional,"My device won't sync with my phone. It was working yesterday but this morning it won't. I have tried all the troubleshooting prescribed un the help section but my watch still won't sync. Update: I uninstalled and reinstalled the app as per tip from troubleshooting. Now, the app won't let me log in and I've been doing this for the past couple of hours. 10/14/2023 update: was able to log back in after phone's system update. In terms of the syncing, the previous version was smoother though.",4.0
Jules Marten,Functional,"Somethings im not a fan of with the new layout (mostly that it shows my most recent weight instead of weight lost on the home screen), but overall it seems alright. I just signed up for Premium again after cancelling it years ago, and so far I really really like it now. There is a large range of works AND different body types and fitness levels for the people in the Videos! I love that! Would be good if it was easier to watch the videos on the TV or computer without needing to buy extra cables.",4.0
Chris Pile,Functional,"Does what it says on the box. Bug report though, I can't access the data on my bike riding. It keep reverting to the current day screen. When I try again the app crashes (and the crash report crashes too). Could be that I'm riding on a training stand (time and rpm, but no distance). Kind of annoying not being able to review. Otherwise, has all the functions you could want.",4.0
Kerry Noble,Functional,"It's a good app for the purpose. I gave it a 4 because I don't like the revised dashboard, not as good as before and more beta like. The activity and footsteps increase as you drive your car, also while sitting at your desk. All of a sudden you've passed the alottment for that hour but haven't moved. Just needs a little fine tuning. But overall I like it. I do like the sleep information it gives you that's the best part.",4.0
Paul Sunell,Functional,"The white background is obnoxious. Fitbit devs really should add a dark theme to the app, to be easier on the eyes when checking stats. Also, my Charge 6 rarely syncs sleep data or days of exercise without having to force close the app and delete cache, or restarting the tracker to get the data to show on the tracker. Hopefully this gets fixed with a software update to the app or firmware update on the tracker itself",4.0
Nicky Saunders,Functional,since Monday 30th Oct my fitbit has been unable to sync with the app. it was working fine but the new version appears to have caused an issue. have tried unloading and re-loading the app but not working still. edit: the help centre were fantastic and have got things going again for me. rating changed accirdingly,4.0
Jessica Douglas,Functional,"New update fixed my issues. I still prefer the look of the old UI though.... ""New update is terrible. Can no longer change what is displayed on my wrist, old version would allow you to add or remove and even rearrange the order of steps, heart rate, distance, calories, etc""",4.0
Paul Watson,Functional,"New app design is a step backwards with half whitespace. Most recent redesign is even less useful. More exercise scrolling and avoiding ads. Still no dark mode, so being sunglasses. Trivial customisation options limit this app, a focus on experienced user experience is needed for the next release. The web interface is a useful contrast with more information available in the starting page. There is potential to provide effective feedback on our charging body.",4.0
Damien Boorman,Functional,"It's a good app (esp with the subscription content) but it NEEDS the ability to be able to sync across multiple devices. I want to be able to use a pixel watch during the day and use my Fitbit for exercise and sleep tracking but you can't currently do this, it will only sync to one device. Honestly I won't buy a pixel watch (more money for Google) until they fix this",4.0
Ivan Mary Fraser,Functional,"Recent update, cannot sync charge 5 to phone. Frustrating. This update has changed a great product and service to a poor one. Have now Uninstalled fitbit app from my phone. Intending to look for non Google options. Ivan UPDATE followed instruction. After trying several (most) of the steps fitbit pairs with my Bluetooth and syncs. Thanks for the help",4.0
Ina Wiese,Functional,I like the app over all but the new version doesn't have a battery charge status icon and it is very inconvenient now. It is very hard to see on the tracker and the app was very helpful before. Now I miss charge time sometime and it is very frustrating.,4.0
Anatsaisa Cauthen,Functional,"I have loved this product for many years and couldn't imagine using any other! My only issue has been the period tracker. It seems to alter or GREATLY miscalculate, and so has not been very useful. Other than that I love everything else!",4.0
Chris Coppola,Functional,"App looks nice, but initially, many pages were broken on the Pixel 8 Pro. After manually clearing user data and reinstalling it seems to work now. Overall the app is helpful and intuitive. Would be nice to have more reminders for things (like drinking water).",4.0
Rilla Price,Functional,"In someway I like the app. To me it has to many pages for the things you need too do. Instead of going straight to the page like you use to. You have to search for the things you use. In others ways it's takes to much time too do it. You waste time , instead going straight to the page itself.",4.0
Gerard Gust,Functional,"I love the new customizable home screen design which is easier to navigate, compared to the old app, which was cluttered and difficult to use. While functionally, the data gathered is the same, the color scheme is slightly disappointing. I hope they add some alternative themes or at least a dark theme. I mainly use the app for sleep data, and that color scheme hasn't changed, which is great. Overall, a great app that now has lots of potential to give users a more customized experience.",4.0
Mary Bare,Functional,"Edit: With the help of your response and the assistance of one of your employees (Vincent Ntarugera), I was able to customize my display. I still find the display dull, and the small check mark is underwhelming when goals are met, but I do like the heart rate range display. The ability to set an alternate start time for things such as ""steps"" would be handy for the many of us working nights (7p-7a), rather than starting over at midnight. Now, that would be a cool update.",4.0
Rossana Menezes,Functional,"I really love the app, but I have a paid subscription and the barcode scanner works 2 out of 10 times. It's kind of annoying having to enter the food info manually. Other than that it's amazing.",4.0
Rose Creehan,Functional,"I like getting my steps everyday and my floors or flights. Although sometimes the flights I don't think are really accurate, I don't like that. You took the level of the battery on my fitbit ultra off of my fitbit app. Don't like that either - But for the most part I love my fitbit ulta",4.0
Chris K,Functional,"Regarding the big update with huge UI changes. Everything is borked. No data loads except for today's steps and those only refreshed if I view ""yesterday"" and go back to ""today"". Shows no connected devices, yet somehow updates my steps. Literally cannot use this app at the moment, hoping they resolve the issues quickly as they have done in the past.",4.0
Melanie Riley,Functional,"Not a fan of the new design. Have not been able to figure out how to use the GPS on phone to map my walks or runs, worked perfect before the upgrade. Like to be able to look back and compare speed heart rate ect. Very dissatisfied with the new app.",4.0
Mark Sanderson,Functional,"App usually syncs perfectly with device and orevious bugs seem to be ironed out. Did not like new layout until I realised you could customise the main dashboard, now the juries out. Good range of data for free, but certainly would not consider subscribing to premium as it is far too expensive, and ultimately I am paying to see my own data.",4.0
The Ellards,Functional,"For this latest update, I really miss having the watch battery status displayed when I open/sync the app on my phone. The battery status is too small for me to see on my watch (Charge 4) by itself. This annoys me. And I agree, the colors are too close in the heart zones. The rest is just a different look to get used to.",4.0
Carolyn Trainor,Functional,"I agree with others about the update being so wrong on so many levels. First, I only want to track what I do.... can't find the ability to list the activities in the order I prefer. The interface is just not as friendly as before. If this is because of the Google move then I don't think I will be linking my account. Google is already messed up as it is. Update: there is a way to customize your activities....it was just hard to find in this new layout.",4.0
Melissa Brown,Functional,"Overall love the app but the recent update has stopped me from being able to edit the name of my workout when I force start one. Before the update, I could go in after I was finished & change the name from workout to spinning, strength training, etc. & now you can't edit the name.",4.0
Ann Shank,Functional,"There use to be a place to see the battery level for my watch, but I can't find one on this new app view. We never by looking on the app to see if it is low or has been charged fully. Please fix this, it would take the guess work out of wondering if or when how much battery life is left.",4.0
Sandra Hayes,Functional,Generally I like it. What I don't like is that the battery indicator does not show the actual percentage left on the fitbit. I miss that from the previous app.,4.0
Ken Wilkinson,Functional,"Good and easy to manage. Great charts and monitoring without having the phone is good and recognizing types, duration and charts are great. Could use some extra personification.",4.0
David Taylor,Functional,"As a 70 year old diabetic, I find this app very useful in helping me manage my health. An area for slight improvement is better recognition of static exercise - building a stone wall did not count as exercise.",4.0
T D Redd,Functional,"I am aporeciatuve tobuse this app. It helps me track info important on my health journey. Overall, the fitbit experience is very good.

Navigating , finding, recording or updating information manually can be tedious at times.",4.0
Carolina Vivancos,Functional,"Love the health tracker and the options the watch gives you to monitor it. It is my first smart watch and I am still exploring options but I also noticed that sometimes it does not sync properly so I get wrong readings, sleep data does not register properly if I get extra rest during the day and I took a while to get used to the app navigation so not super impressed with the friendliness of it.",4.0
Dave Blizzard,Functional,"I have now converted to use a pixel watch instead of Fitbit hardware with this app. Now Fitbit and the Pixel watch always syncs with no problem at all...

Lynn Anderson,Functional,"Re-editing. Had difficulty with the new update. Spent over an hour problem solving. Turns out my phone turned off all background fitbit permissions somehow.

Angee Goebel,Functional,I like getting sleep data each morning g - a big improvement on the previous version where I didn't get sleep data automatically when I opened the app each morning..Step count is useful and I like the free exercise sessions.,4.0
Michele,Functional,"Love the app, use it all the time. The four star rating is because of the logging food part of the app. I wish there was more personal control over which foods stay on the different lists. I have ""recent"" foods from 2 months ago, but not something I had yesterday. I also wish that when logging water that you could create or scan a custom size for quick entry. I think one of the most common sized bottles is 16.9 ounces.",4.0
Regina Olson,Functional,Update 10-17-23 Fitbit gave me 50% off a new watch. We'll see how long this will last. Ever since the new update on my charge 5 it keeps disconnecting from my phone and app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Restarted my phone. Restarted the charge 5. Now I can't get it to connect to the app and Bluetooth on my phone. Udated 9-7-23 replacement charge 5 same issue but this time it went completely black and would not come back on. Even after doing all the steps to reset.,4.0
Ghica Gheorghiu,Functional,"I purchased Sense 2 for a single reason: ECG, and the pisibility to send it to my mobile. The latest update removed this possibility. I've tried everything. Sense 2 is now for me a useless device. I wish I could returned it. 1 day later, ECG back in app, and working properly. Accurate ECG (repeatedly confirmed by a professional device). I've changed my initial low rating. App needs a better structure, too many steps to reach a functionality, or back to main dash.",4.0

Ronda Del Boccio,Functional,Well I'm still getting used to the changes since Google took over. The interface has changed a little bit and some things were in different places. I miss the challenges. But I definitely love the Fitbit.,4.0
Olly The Lion,Functional,Very nice app it's so easy to use and I love how it tracks basically every activity you do I 100% recommend this app!! Often glitches with syncing and in Bluetooth it says you need an app to connect to this device even though I have the app,4.0
Waddles Stokes,Functional,"The new update is a little hard to understand, I feel the layout was perfectly fine the way it was and this overhaul was a bit too much all at once. I hope they are listening to feedback and will think about their design choices.",4.0
David Youngflesh,Functional,"Most recent update significantly changed the GUI. Okay, fine; I can deal with most change. But the new app does not allow you to find/see the battery charge percentage when you're charging the device. That's S.T.U.P.I.D. The Sense2 charger is finicky enough as it is. Having to go check your Sense2 to see whether or not it's actually charging at a reasonable speed is a pain. The app should show this. There's no reason for it not to.",4.0
Stephanie Black,Functional,"After days of struggling with this device and app I finally got it to sync up with my phone and tablet and an additional app, Myfitnesspal. It has been great to track my food and calorie expenditures. It tracks my sleep, breathing, steps, and trends. I have to admit that these are very helpful and I'm sold on them. I can't give it a 4 star rating because set up is so clunky but if you persist then things should come right.",4.0
Johnathan Schaffer,Functional,"It seems to be a controversial opinion, but I really like the UI redesign. The only negative thing is some of the detail screens haven't been updated yet and still have the old design making things feel kind of unfinished. I'm assuming these will be updated in a future version.",4.0
Faith DeRosia,Functional,It's a good way to get an idea where you are at on average. Keeps pretty good track of steps and it is fun to see what it rates your sleep and the sleep patterns. Does not always record activities and getting additional data requires a paid upgrade.,4.0
sinitta Currie,Functional,"I can only give 4 stars because they rook away the fit bit challenges. That honestly was fun foe the whole family, so I was dissapointed they took it away, and even though you are supposed to be able to create a group amongst family and friends to create a challenge it doesn't work. Other than that love being able to see and track my progress.",4.0
Sherman Pay,Functional,"Sometimes the app doesn't sync with the watch, and I have to restart the watch. I I would also like to set-up more sophisticated reminders. For example, if I don't have 5000 steps by 1pm, remind me. Or I haven't exercised for two days.",4.0
Ellen Robinson,Functional,"The app is very good. The new watch I purchased several(2-3) months ago stopped working. It was replaced with a refurbished one. SMH!! Now, with this one, it has issues. I've had to restart it twice already. 1st time I called customer service, 2nd time I did it myself from previous call info.",4.0
Shamim Hussain,Functional,"For personal use, fitbit has improved my life in many ways so it's more than 5 stars! Only thing to improve is to bring back the challenges! It helps so much with group motivation and challenging others whilst pushing yourself. It's too good to get rid of. Please reconsider the challenges. Thank you.",4.0
Simon A Morning,Functional,I can't find some of the premium video workouts in this new version. In particular the 6 week Davina McCall programme. There is no obvious search option. Just filters that don't really help. UPDATE: I've found a workaround. Instead of going into the Coach tab directly go into Settings and FitBit Premium ( Explore your Premium Membership) > Video Workouts. The OwnYourGoals Davina Challenge appears! I've set all of them as favourites now so we're good.,4.0
Nicole Nyhlen,Functional,"The app is great and functions the way it should. But it would be nice to be able to edit a few of the functions to make notations as to the workouts and personal things (menstrual cycle). It would also be nice for the daily information to be able to be displayed for historical day, ie. Weight, exercise, food, etc.",4.0
Von Lambright,Functional,"1Oct23_The new update is good, except for the removal of the battery percentage! Please bring it back! 2020_I love this app! Especially the reminders to move every hour.

When are they going to have more detailed stats on blood oxygen level, especially when wearing a face mask?",4.0
Locus Focus,Functional,"It was all good, until the latest update. I can't see the battery level of my Fitbit anymore. I want that back. (Going into settings to see ""medium"" is not helpful, we had a % at the top of the app screen when refreshing data!)",4.0
Jo Fr,Functional,"Boring design. App is functional but boring now. For some reason I can no longer see my battery percentage, which is annoying as I have to find it on the watch itself. Doesn't seem to have as much flexibility on what to show on the homepage.",4.0
Steve Lai,Functional,Ok. Edited review. Latest update was horrible at start as the migration from Fitbit acc to Google acc is not the smoothest. It caused your app to have loading issues and somewhat crash with white screen. Took time and patience to uninstall app and reinstall it. Failed the first time and worked the 2nd time. All good for now~,4.0
Smileyrat,Functional,"To others users: there is a manual seting for the Foucus. Edit & swip right. While I like the app & find it useful, even in its free form, if you're going to screw with a UI & not give a way to opt out, you will upset a lot of people. Since we are aperently redesigning the UI: The new UI is ugly, blinding bright, & laid out to display less information. Remove section heders and let me drag-and-drop things to move them around individually. Also let me use those small icons or bars for everything.",4.0
Susie Villalobos,Functional,"Overall, the premium fitbit app it is a great addition to a healthy lifestyle. The food tracker needs help. They should look to myfitnesspal. The scanner is hit or miss. Recipe analysis is nonexistent. If the food part was improved I'd give it a 5.",4.0
Pamela Foreman,Functional,Since the recent update I cannot amend an activity type. In the old version there was a drop down menu to pick from. Now when I edit nothing happens - no keyboard to start typing or no menu? Seem able to amend all the other data such as date/times etc.,4.0
nathen Conduff,Functional,I like how quick and easy it is to get used to useing the app. and that it allows for costom meals and foods without the premium.,4.0
O.Spenc,Functional,"Great app so far, but very frustrating that you can only have the set meals for recording (breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks). Easy enough to allow added meals without making it a default choice (for gym goers this is essential). Please add, otherwise myfitnesspal will be the go to.",4.0
Vicki M,Functional,"I have been using this app for 2 - 3 years now. It's brilliant and has so much on there to help you through your personal challenges in life, let's face it weight/exercise/water so much more. If you wish to access all of it, it's only Â£15.99 per year or Â£1.33 per month. Depends how you want to use the app. But your always finding more stuff on there to use. Graphs etc. Love this app. And if you need help these guys reply to you fast. Bonus. ðŸ‘",4.0
Shannon Higgs,Functional,"I love this app. The only thing I wish I could change about this is that when you exercise, those calories are subtracted from. The ones you ate, so you budget isn't added to, but your imout is subtracted from. I feel it makes sense to me to do it that way. Other than that great app â˜ºï¸",4.0
Francisco T,Functional,Good app that helped me but only thing is there are mistakes in the counting of portions. Sometimes you put by cup or by grams will give you different values even for the same quantity. Also when I send picture of product and nutrition fact they create the entry with mistakes sometimes it has nothing to do with the product,4.0
Joy Ehi,Functional,"I'll like to make a suggestion to the app developers, it'll be great if the food option is expanded, not all of us are in America or have the kind of food menu over there and sometimes when I try to enter the food I ate it's not on the app, i go as far as searching online for the English name of some of the food in my region, I'm from Nigeria in Africa. Other than that I really love the app. Kudos.",4.0
Donnie Wormith,Functional,"Really good app, but I feel there are a few problems. First, I'm 15 with a bw of 160, aiming for 170, and apparently my maintenance is 3000 calories, with my activity level at low. So it's suggesting me to be eating 3500 a day which I'm pretty sure isn't correct for just 1lb/week. Second of all, I was curious to see the maintenance calories if my activity level was high, but now I can't change it back. Please fix this",4.0
David,Functional,"Would be five stars if food searches didn't prioritize American processed foods. Not all of us live in the USA, and sometimes we want to search for a basic food item without having a store attached to it. Otherwise everything is great, everything you need for diet and exercise in one app.",4.0
Sherry Lynn,Functional,"Love the app and after paying for the first month, I decided on a year's subscription. But would you please try to incorporate more activities and calorie expenditure info for those of us who have mobility issues? Walking, running and hiking are wonderful for people who can enjoy those activities. What about alternatives for those who have to spend even part of their day using a walker, maneuvering a wheelchair or even doing seated aerobics? Would be sure so grateful!",4.0
Ks G,Functional,I've only been using this app for about 2 weeks. It has a free option; I love that it has the scan feature for unknown foods; that I can email pics of foods to have corrected nutritional info; you can add personal recipes and nutrition info; you can star frequent foods that you eat daily or repeat meals with 1 click; also I can log my daily weight & steps. This app tracks my info. This app so far has been just what I have been searching for!,4.0
Carrie,Functional,"I LOVE this app BUT it needs a recipe builder. Yes it will import recipes but when I make something not necessarily from a recipe online, I would like to be able to log it and I am having a hard time doing so. UPDATE: there is a recipe builder it's just hard to find. Go to ""My Foods"" then ""My recipes"" and at the bottom there is a create button, click that and start adding your Ingredients.",4.0
Isabel Brinca,Functional,"Great app, I have tried a few others and this one suits me very well. I'm giving 4 stars only because it doesn't integrate with Mi bands",4.0

Nishant Patil,Functional,I didn't subscribe for the premium version of the app and Rs.800 was deducted from my account How do I get refund. Kudos to support team for resolving my issue.,4.0
Robert Haehnel,Functional,Really good app. Needs separate category for tracking daily vitamin and mineral supplements.,4.0
Kevin Cosby,Functional,the app works well but constantly receive ads asking you subscribe which I would do of the annual expense wasn't as unreasonable.,4.0
Rotisserie Kitten,Functional,"there used to be an option to make your own recipes, and I wish they would bring that feature back.",4.0
Lisa Boring,Functional,Loving this so far. Intuitive and easy to use. Full of info. Thank you! I'm trying the free trial premium. One suggestion: I love reviews. It would be nice if users could leave a review and/or comments on each recipe. Maybe a chat room to encourage one another. (That was two suggestions.ðŸ˜‰),4.0
Chakib Izeboudjene,Functional,"great app, i use the free version but the premium one seems to have even more features, nonetheless you can get by just fine with the free features, a big catalogue of foods, no intrusive ads, user friendly interface.",4.0
Rotisserie Kitten,Functional,"there used to be an option to make your own recipes, and I wish they would bring that feature back.",4.0
Janet G,Functional,I like the app. I would have given it 5 stars if it connected to popular blood glucose apps such as Livongo and mySugar and imported those readings into the program. Livongo also captures BP and weight from its' wireless devices and would be a good option for this software.,4.0
Raven Martin,Functional,"really solid app, has helped me lose weight consistently. However, there are some inconsistencies with nutritional data (calories are sometimes off).",4.0
Shana Thompson,Functional,pretty good app. only issue I have is its kinda difficult to create meal that I eat often. all in all it's helped me lose weight and keeps me accountable.,4.0
Janine Roberts,Functional,"This app has all the bells and whistles. It is a very thorough food tracker...and more...BUT I found the UI to be clunky and not as smooth as the app I just started using, Calorie Counter by Lose It! It was hard to pick between the two but Lose It won by a smidge. Lose It just looks cleaner, is more pleasing to the eye, and is more user friendly. That's important to me. Otherwise, it's a very fine app. I may give it another go someday!",4.0
lemon6,Functional,"I really like this app, however the new update is not good. In the daily analysis, it now gives no critiques and only gives positives. While I like the positives, knowing where I went wrong was very helpful.",4.0
Kasey W,Functional,Great App!!! So far I'm completely satisfied! I am using the free version and I'm so satisfied I am almost tempted to purchase the full version. ðŸ˜‰,4.0
Ondrej,Functional,"Almost good. I strongly miss support for other languages and Photo Food Label recognition, e.g. in German language.",4.0
Simon Dane,Functional,"MyNetDiary is a comprehensive food tracking app that feels accurate and can be trusted. Unfortunately, it expects ongoing payments to track more than fat, carbs and protein. I'd definitely pay a one-off fee for it tho. Edit: Apparently there is one... How do we find it?",4.0
haylestormable,Functional,"I like it so far, it actually shows how the food I log may affect my diet. Plenty of tools to use. Only thing I hate is how much they push premium",4.0

christy benhaim,Functional,they won't give you a lot of the features unless you pay. I guess that's standard though,4.0
Nyo McGirt,Functional,"I really like this app. There are a couple of minor flaws such as not being able to modify a recipe once you entered into the app. Also, I'm not sure how accurate the macronutrient info is when you enter a recipe manually. Otherwise it's a pretty great app overall .",4.0
Patrick Hammack,Functional,"I'm using this to monitor my fat, protein, and carb intake. Also can record my water consumption. Very few ads to buy premium version. My only complaint is the interface is a little cluttered for my tastes.",4.0
Disoriented Entanglement,Functional,The reliance on servings as a unit of measurement is difficult to work with - how much is a serving of steak? I don't see a way to enter different units. Also a recent update has made the interface for logging food much more awkward. If I log an item I've had before such as apples there's no way to change the size or quantity.,4.0
Jesus Villegas,Functional,"It's pretty good, but they just nerfed the weight trends graph. It's new and looks nice, but the range in the graph is like +/- 20 lbs making the weight trend over time look like a straight line. I used to look to see it fall through my weight loss journey, now it's just so umnotivating. How has the graph displaying year kot been fixed from year to date to a full year. So useless especially at the beginning of the year. Edit: they fixed that.",5.0
Tina Medkeff,Functional,"I now have a Charge 4, upgraded from a Flex. The app works great with it. Love all the information it provides. February 2023- Just upgraded to a Charge 5. Loving it! It comes with a free 6 month premium subscription. I now have all the benefits of this app. The data it provides is very informative and enlightening. Update: Not a fan of the new app layout. I don't like that the battery status is no longer displayed. Please bring it back.",5.0
Andrea Bartels,Functional,"I have been part of the Fitbit family since 2012. I like improvements, but I did like the old app better. Also, I recently switched to the Garmin because I wanted something that looked more like a watch and not a fitness tracker. I think that's probably my biggest disappointment. I wound up taking off the Garmin and putting the Fitbit back on. Because nothing is more accurate or gives me the best overall data of my health than Fitbit. As for the app I will get used to the change, I hope..",5.0
Jay Donovan,Functional,I have an inspire 2. The software is not synching. It is useless if it won't work with my device. OK. Update. Fitbit saw my comments and fixed the problem. They were very understanding too. I think I will be sticking around awhile. No product would be any good without great support. This product is one of the good well rounded rarities. I am happy.,5.0
Stephanie Caravello-Hibbert,Functional,"In the past year, recovering from brain surgery, I had two incidents of tachycardia. Because of that I use my fitbit, not just for steps, but to keep track of my heart rate and sleep patterns. It's great that I can check for irregular heart rate as well. I noticed someone had trouble syncing. I just shut down Bluetooth mode then turn it back on and that fixes that problem.",5.0
Stephonie Mack,Functional,"Great tool for tracking how many steps, floors climbed, amount of REM, light & deep sleep. Many features I don't currently use, but great to have in case I want to log in how much water I'm drinking or keep a record of my resting heart rate.

S. Lopez (SunDevil311),Functional,"Great overall user experience, though the main interface could be improved. Far too many features are buried underneath any number of categories. There needs to be a more straightforward and direct method to see: (1) a listing of all advanced measurements/data (i.e., your cardio fitness score, sleep quality breakdown, etc.) and (2) the detailed information/reports available from this tracking.",5.0
Kathy Ewing,Functional,"This is the very best thing I've ever done or bought for my fitness and weight loss. It's effortless, which is super important to me, a retired teacher. Keeping track of my steps was a big eye-opener. And, at first, I thought the hourly tracking for 9 daytime hrs was really dumb (though never interfering), but now it's turned into a little game for me. My only complaint is that for months, the sleep tracker got a LOT wrong, but they must have fixed it because it's been right for a month now.",5.0
JJ Reed,Functional,"I love the Charge 4 and the App. I use it along with another weightloss tracker app (LoseIt!). I love that they communicate. However, the last week has been difficult in that area. Fitbit stopped adding my steps into the exercise count on the other app. It only starts again if I Uninstall the fitbit app and reinstall it. Is there an easier way? This is a new issue after having both apps for a year so I'm still pleased with Fitbit!",5.0
Bill Gardiner,Functional,Fitbit premium has helped me track my health stats better than I ever have been able to. The only two things that I take outside of Fitbit in a major way is my interstitial fluid pH and perform a live blood cell test once a month. Hard to say how these can be added to the app. The watch is a little difficult to operate in swimming mode. Particularly it is hard to stop the exercise either by voice or tapping. When the exercise is complete. The double tap required often pulls up another screen,5.0
Joyce Shields,Functional,"Awesome.Using this app mostly for O2sat average ,steps,and sleep data. When I needed help once or twice you were able to fix problem within a few minutes and a few hours 2nd time. I rely on Fitbit every day Thank you. Has continued without problem. The watch band gets plastic fatigue & I was having to order a new one every year. Solution found: slip an ""O"" ring over band to hold it in place. Still mostly use it for O2sat average, steps, and sleep data. Have not needed to call for help. Thanks.",5.0
Lorena Dinger,Functional,"I love this app. It works reliably and provides information and resources to help me improve my health.

A Google user,Functional,"I love the Fitbit Charge 2! I appreciate the features on the tracker itself and the software that it interacts with it. I find the counters accurate. They motivate me to do more and better. This device is helpful at any age---I am in my seventies. Caution however about the Fitbit Charge 3: I found it to be an inferior piece of technology. I have no idea why the company is transitioning to that product, unless it is substantially cheaper to manufacture.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,Has all I want of what to keep track. I like the fact you can change watch faces. Steps and heart rate are important to me. I can check the weather forecast. It has reminder alarms. It is connected to the Aria scale we use. I only take it off to charge. One minor downside is the lack of wrist band choices. The standard rubber one irritates my skin. Was very affordable. Many apps to download if you are inclined. This app with the Versa watch is highly recommended. I almost never give 5 stars!,5.0
Gage Trader,Functional,"I've been a Fitbit user for years and I love the data presented by the app. The UI is simple and intuitive, and very responsive.

Bob New,Functional,"Its everything I've been looking for! Having this on 24/7 (Not when showering, although I believe you can get water on it w/o damage when you use the water lock mode) I find that I'm more ""motivated"" to exercise, walk, workout, etc. on a regular daily basis. It allows me to see what's happening with my heart, steps, calories, hydration, sleep, breathing, etc. at any time, all day long when synced with the app/smart phn. I would highly recommend you get one. 5 stars across the boards! Thanks, Bob",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"By far the easiest app for fitness tracking. The devices are getting more and more accurate too, so I use this to track sleep and heart rate improvement.

C Davis,Functional,"I'm very happy with the way the Fitbit tracks my steps, but more importantly I'm happy with the way they have improved the synching of the device and phone.

NUMEROUS times, and that the syncing issue was not on my end. I received my replacement tracker in the mail last week, and was able to get it to work. I have not had any issues thus far, just proving that it was a tracker issue. Thankful that they finally sent me a replacement tracker. Hoping to get at least a year out of this one.",5.0
Isaac Shelton,Functional,Fitbit app has been a great tool to use with the smartwatch. The ability to log food and track workouts is great. My largest complaint is with fitbit premium - the features sound nice - but not worth the price tag. $10 a month or $80 a year is pretty expensive for a smart phone app. If the service was priced at $5 a month/$40 a year it would be something worth picking up.,5.0

A Google user,Functional,"I love this app. How it syncs with my device and how I can update on my desktop at work, then have the data available on my phone later.

It's indispensable.",5.0
Kevin Simpson,Functional,Helps me understand my day and energy levels with sleep scores. It's good data to help keep my fitness goals on track.

Chris Gossett,Functional,"I've used this app now for over 3 years. I'm not saying it is perfect but it has been nice tracking activities for that period of time. I wish we could set different goals for each day of the week but it can track all the workouts (not weights but it's better at rep counting then I am sometimes). I run/walk most and it is nice to look back and see course layouts, times, splits, and heart rate is a major stat for me. I assume it isn't as accurate as a chest strap (not compatible) but good enough.",5.0
A Caison,Functional,"I really enjoy the app - especially the sleep score function. However, for the past several days this function hasn't been loading properly.

A Google user,Functional,"I've used fitbit for many years. I enjoy the updates and new features. I've had the new Charge 3 for a few months. Unfortunately it stopped charging. The watch will not allow the ""hard reset"" because it wont recognize the charging cable. (New or old) So holding down the button doesn't help. I wish the app had suggested or helpful information to fix this issue. I will continue to use fitbit even though I have this one issue. The products and features are worth it. Thank you",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I didn't realize how often I forget to drink water until I started tracking it. It makes it really easy to count calories in vs calories out and still make sure I'm getting enough protien. I also really like the new menstrual cycle tracker. It makes logging my period really easy so I'm not caught unprepared when it starts any more. I'm sure there are other cycle tracking apps, but having a general health tracking app that can cover multiple different needs is great. My phone is a little old and I play a lot of games on it, so I don't have a lot of room for a bunch of different apps.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I have 2 Fitbits and like that I can switch depending on what I am doing. I'm hoping the new update fixes the lag when syncing during my switch between Fitbits. I like that I can hide parts of the app I don't use like the woman's health tracker. Unless you are trying to get pregnant, and there are apps for that, you don't have to deal with monthly issues and menopause takes care of that annoyance after that. Tracking sleep and activities is awesome. I like tracking my weight but input it myself because I haven't found the smart scales reliable enough yet. Keep up the improvements.",5.0
Verna Scott,Functional,"It is very motivating to keep moving .. good for overall health. Especially like the sleep part of the app .. I now know for sure i feel rested with a score of 80 or more. Have paid more attention to that. To mix it up, I try for miles instead of steps. Works for me. Tks Fitbit 2023.. The updates to this app are excellent....more detail. For example, how hard are you working. Like that one ..all new in each category with options to purchase additional detail. .tks great again.",5.0
Blathnaid Donnelly,Functional,"This app is a great way to keep fit. It has challenges, parents can track there kids scores (which is really useful with sleep), it will give you notifications when your fitbit needs charging, you can add your friends so you can do competitions with your freinds to see who had the most steps in the week, you can choose your own profile pic (not your face). The last really useful thing is you can change the way the time is displayed on your actual fitbit. In conclusion if you have a fitbit. Bye",5.0
Corina Matei,Functional,"I don't know why people don't like the new redesign (i saw an article headline). It looks sleek, nice, modern and airy. It has the typical Google design language. Things are simplified. The colour scheme switched from Fitbit branded to the OS theme colours, which I like because it's more cohesive with other apps and customisable across all.",5.0
User 02,Functional,"I like the app overall. Jumping to a possible feature, if not already/don't think so, any chance to add a ""pause steps"" quick access/app button/toggle switch on/off? Public transit, personal Evs/bikes, driving in a car registers steps and does'nt help with overall daily step tracking accuracy... Please consider adding? Missing several steps forgetting to turn back on is better than registering thousands+/-steps incorrectly, no? Thanks4reply. *My point is 4 u to better automate this process?",5.0
Greg D,Functional,"I like tracking sleep and activity. When I think I had a good night's sleep or workout, it's nice when the numbers back that up. Two suggestions-1. Can we overlay the oxygen level line graph over the sleep chart bar graph?...to see if it correlates. 2. Love 'Find My Phone' feature. How about one that alerts our phone or fitbit if we move one more than 100ft from the other? I.E.- we left phone behind or left fitbit on the charger. Also a 'Fitbit Charged 100%' phone notification would help.",5.0
TA P,Functional,"Clock stopped working after doing July 6, 2022 update on my fitbit versa lite. Tried everything to get it started to correct time. It is frozen at 5:58 AM except its 8:40 AM.

I hope to have my fitbit versa lite for many years to come!",5.0
Kim Sykes,Functional,"I've been using fitbit for about 7 years. It's helped me change my life after a heart attack. I've met my weight goals and feel better than I have in years.

The app is very easy to use and provides so much information in a great format.",5.0
K Lee Willie,Functional,"I'm addicted to this app and the data it gives me on my activity, sleep, stress levels, and the meditation sessions.

David Lindley,Functional,"Love the new interface. Slicker, more flexible, and in line with best practice data visualization principles (I work in this area).

I have restarted my phone twice and I'm not going to keep doing that because I have more than enough memory on my phone. I am ready to uninstall and return the Fitbit for a refund.

Abigail Neal,Functional,"It's absolutely amazing. I love this Fitbit. What I enjoy most about my Fitbit is how it keeps me on track to keep moving.

Susan Neff,Functional,It's structured differently than it was before. This is not bad just takes a bit longer for me to enter numbers. Actually the emotional part is stressed more and mind/body are easier to understand.,5.0

Tristina Huff,Functional,"I loved using this app but unfortunately it is no longer syncing my Inspire 2 and I can't update what I need for my watch. It's very frustrating.

Gavin Hartge,Functional,Fitbit has helped my life keeping it in order and disciplined. Helps me with managing my chronic pain and keeps me mindful of my exercise and life. Highly recommend for anyone trying to get into any form of fitness or health. Turns out my pixel watch didn't like updating unless I left it on the charger for a day.,5.0
Amelia Martin,Functional,The user experience greatly depends on what device you have. The app has a lot more features with my Sense than it did with my Inspire HR. One thing that I have had a problem consistently is having my weight recorded when I step on my Aria Air. I have to force a stop in the app settings and then open up the app for it to record my weight and it doesn't even record my BMI. I also wish you could record your blood pressure in app like you can record you blood glucose.,5.0

M Welch,Functional,"UPDATE!! Changing 1 star back to 5 star. I've used a fitbit ZIP since it's founding. Through the years updates to apps would make it NOT sync easily to the phone. Customer service never helped citing age of my fitbit or model of my phone. It was so frustrating saying ""click to update software"" and it would not update or connect. I wrote customer service but again got no where. Battery died again but this time it's WORKING and SYNCING! THANK YOU FOR FINALLY MAKING IT WORK AGAIN!",5.0
Anne Middleton,Functional,I really don't like this new version. The older one was brilliant more colourful and much easier to use. Please bring back the original version.

Tom Bryant,Functional,"Update - updating again as of 18 Sept 23. Catching up on all missed entries back to 21 August... for me Fitbit (app) has been syncing with the Onetouch glucose app bringing over the readings into Fitbit - I really like it as it's very helpful in comparing glucose readings with the foods I'm consuming. Unfortunately readings from Onetouch stopped transferring over to the Fitbit app this past Monday 8/21/23. Have read all the forum activity, uninstalled/reinstalled.",5.0
ChristiAnne Smith,Functional,"Since the redesign, the tracker feature for runs & walks with a map is no longer available - which was its best feature. Also, fatburn, cadio, & peak have been replaced by light, moderate, vigorous, & peak, and only tells you after the fact so exercise intensity can not be altered or seen in real time. Very dissatisfied with the new look, which is far less detailed. The old Fitbit app was perfect. Now it's just a glorified stepcounter.",5.0
Stephanie Belcher,Functional,"I didn't like the update and posted that. It was slow. A developer responded letting me know the fix (stop app, log out, restart, login). I did the fix, and waited a bit to make sure it works. It works so I changed my review. Thanks for the quick response!",5.0
jimtomatola,Functional,"Much improved connectivity. Almost constant updates from the Charge 2 I have connected to it. If I were to make changes I would put the "" Choose your favorite 4 measurements to track "" setup screen first in line instead of last behind sleep, exercise, etc",5.0
Roy W.,Functional,"Works well with the Fitbit. My wife and I have used it for years now. Version releases come out every so often with occasional new features. It's a little pricy at the pro rate. We're retired, fixed income, so it'd be nice to have an AARP rate for us old folks. That said, we can give a 5 star rating. It's helping us live healthier. Cheers",5.0
Stephen Grantham,Functional,"Once set up and paired it's great. Charge your Fitbit then take your time setting up account & password. Ensure Bluetooth enabled. It's great, sort of gives new meaning to casual exercise. App works ok, nice fresh look and feel. No problems once paired. Just follow instructions carefully. Google run this now, latest version does not put percentage number against battery which is a shame.",5.0
Joe Gibson,Functional,"The most recent update has great quality of life improvements. While it may look like just a reskin of the old app, it does provide a bit better navigation. But where it really shines is reliability of the data synced between the Pixel Watch and the app. Before the update it could be incredibly inaccurate. I could go up and down dozens of stairs, while the app would say I'd done 0, my watch would say I'd done all my hourly steps, while the app would randomly delete some hours. All fixed now!",5.0
Samantha Dunn,Functional,"Since the update, this app is confusing and DULL DULL DULL! No colours, bland and difficult to navigate to find my data. Also the woke language... gone is fat burning, in comes moderate... I am more inspired to work harder if I see fat burning! Agree with other reviews, am seeking out alternative competitors for new watch. I just hope the App designer for Fitbit doesn't follow over to the same competitor ... Very disappointed Fitbit.. you could have done better",5.0
James Keen,Functional,"I for one really like and appreciate the new layout. It works very well for me. Everything is easy to find and the main information I need is now front and centre. The colours are more consistent and less busy. My only complaint is that it's not everywhere. For instance when you go into the weight section, that's still in the old style. But I'm sure that will come. Nice work Google/fitbit.",5.0
Mrs CiCi LOVE,Functional,"EXCELENTE DEVICE. Appreciate all the wellness extras via the app, however the latest update now limits what you are able to view in your activity history.

Jeff Cabay,Functional,"I absolutely love my Versa 4. My biggest success was losing over 50 lbs in a 9-month period. The food app was the key! If you stay in your budget, you will lose weight. I was unknowingly consuming 3500/4000 calories/day. You will not lose weight eating that much unless you burn 4000 to 4500 calories/day. The app helped me figure all of this out. I would love to see in future updates a way to switch from steps to punches. I do lots of boxing. ðŸ¥ŠðŸ’¥ Also, update to Health Connect more often! ðŸ˜‰",5.0
Shannon Seymour,Functional,"I'm addicted to my fit bit and app! Best device ever. I calculate my calories and it does my steps.

Irfan Mirza,Functional,I had some concerns. This app is complete and constructive. It provides greater than I need on daily basis. But there's one thing that i have to do every now and then.

I used to think the devs cared about us, but this recent uptick in the amount of ads to upgrade to the full version (oh, and the, like, $80 price jump) hows they really just care about money. Seriously disappointed and if it continues to get worse, I will to delete the app.",1.0

Sawyer Whitley,Functional,"I used to love this app. So much so that I was thinking about paying the membership about a month ago, but when I went to do it the price was far higher than the 39.99 I was expecting. I get that thing increase in price sometimes, but it doubled. That didn't bother me though, until the recent update where I now get an ad every day asking me to buy the membership for ""half off"" aka the original price. I get you need to make money, but I'd rather get an actual discount than a daily pretend sale ad",1.0
Josh Havnes,Functional,My Finch kept telling me a lot of things I wasn't comfortable with.

Xander Callahan,Functional,My phone was being stupid and I had to delete the app and reinstall it my account effectively went back hours of work it was gone I did backup the file but apparently it deleted the backup along with it I don't know if there's much you can do but my bird's name was Luigi it was adult and all my pets are gone so that means I'm changing my review to one star review,1.0

Luu Nguyen,Functional,"This app went from $40 a year to $70, and within a couple weeks, the price was hiked to $119.88. What the heck kind of price jump is that?! I paid for a year's subscription back in 22', but there is no way I'm paying for either of those prices. The app is decent and is helpful, but if you expect to charge people that kind of money for the little perks you receive with a plus account, you are out of your minds. I won't recommend this app to anyone anymore.",1.0
Trevor Cale,Functional,"I absolutely LOVE this app. HOWEVER, it is a colossal failure that you are only allowed to send your Finch on one journey per day, regardless of how many goals you complete. In other words, I strongly feel this is limiting my momentum when I would like to be UNLIMITED and allowed to grow at a rate that is in correlation with how many goals I complete. DO NOT PUT A LIMIT ON US!!!!",1.0
M E,Functional,I don't know what you've done to this app now but I can't go back on my past to do list and swipe to clear my tasks that I didn't get cleared now!

I'm getting so annoyed with this app.,1.0
Jennifer Salome,Functional,"I loved loved loved this app, it was so important to my mental health and keeping my day in check. However, for some reason, my data got corrupted and my friend is suddenly gone. I had been doing data backups, but suddenly they weren't available when I needed them. Support was remorseful but unhelpful. I was even a paying user. Word to the wise would be to enjoy this app but for the love of everything, make sure your backups are accessible! I don't know if I'll use it again because I'm so upset.",1.0
N O,Functional,"Pretty bummed. Really wanted my kid and I to use this app but it is insanely expensive in my opinion. $70 a year each person!? There is no way I can afford that. Won't even chance the ""7 day free trial"" because 2 reasons. 1- I am afraid we will love it and know what we are missing out on and 2- I would probably forget and be charged $140 for us both. There should be a free version of this, even if it meant having to deal with ads. In any case, this is a no go for us until it's more affordable.",1.0
Rebecca H,Functional,"After a week, I had to downgrade my review. It is a good app for adding habits and start a routine, but the initial setup takes hours as they do not have a walk through and you waste time searching. Also, the app promotes self care and provides info for reducing anxiety, yet two features are in direct conflict with this purpose. Including holddng your data hostage with a required mental health check every time you open it. A simple ""skip"" on that screen would prevent this anxiety INDUCING step",1.0
Chris,Functional,"Update: i paid for premium and it was ok for a while but i quickly grew tired of it and since its quite expensive i wanted to cancel the renewal, turns out it wont let me in the app or in google settings.

Ashoka Khufre,Functional,Well the issue has been that when the month is short and this app does not realize that then there's two problems One you've already gone to the next month so you don't get the very last day of the previous month and two you don't get the first day of the new month because the app is stuck on the last day from the previous month so it's ding dang if you do and ding ding if you don't You lose two ways.

Pig Lastname,Functional,"""self help"" app monitized the same way as terrible game apps like clash royale.

Apps lose all of their credibility when we're repeatedly asked to spend money before were given any information",1.0

Adriana Souza,Functional,"This app was great. This is probably stupid, so take it with a grain of salt, but this was my experience: In the beginning I liked the events, especially as a plus member. But missing a day or two and missing out on the items just gave me FOMO/anxiety and I stopped logging in all together as soon as I had a busier day at work and missed it, lol, which is ironic. I wish they would just let us collect everything. I've cancelled my subscription since.",1.0

Shady Sam,Functional,"I can't figure out how this has 4.9 stars. Finch almost immediately offers microtransactions and stole the entire app concept from gameify. It offers the most basic of coping skill applications that you can learn about in any youtube video for free. And that's it.

This was cute way to get throught day.",1.0
Treva Dodge,Functional,There are 5 problems. So when you first download it and then it takes forever. And usually it doesn't. Problem 2 you start to get In and they force you to pay.

Samantha Gossett,Functional,"App has potential. Need to expand the concept of taking care of a bird. It takes 2 tasks to adventure. Extra really doesn't do anything.

Possibly larger life goals like learn to fly costing more energy. Just to keep you going and have it actually be ""caring for the finch by caring for yourself"".",1.0
Gabe Gillette,Functional,"I used the app a lot last summer (2022) and it was fantastic, it really helped me. Unfortunatly, they kept updating. The devs dont seem to understand that an app like this needs to be SIMPLE. It's overwhelming now, the constant pop-ups for events and visitors. Theres TOO many features. If I need to use the app I have to go through layers of stimuation, this is bad design, especially for a mental health app.",1.0

No name,Functional,Decreases its accessible features without payong with every update. Gets more in-app transactions with every update. Now has stressful timed events. Shortly it got from a really calming app to an app that is more stressful. Also instead of just having your bird outside you now are stuck in a tiny room unless you go on an adventure. So great app that got to an okay app over the course of the last few months.,1.0

Paige Tessier,Functional,They offered a 7 day free trial two days ago and just charged my card the full year subscription fee before the free trial period ended. Please read the other 1 star reviews before using this app! I'm not the only one they've scammed with their '7 day free trial' and then they just tell you to reach out to Google play for a refund. They shouldn't be charging anyone's cards until after the free trial period is completed for anyone to have to reach out to Google play in the first place.,1.0
Rachel Anderson,Functional,"Twice now, the app has started crashing on start up no matter what I do. The first time, the backup didn't even save properly so I couldn't go back to my old save. It did the second time, but the fact that it happened twice, and the second time less than a week since the first time, doesn't motivate me to continue. It's a shame, because when the app works it's great, but having the same problem twice doesn't make me w we t to continue with it.",1.0
Unknown,Functional,"The app crashes if you open it from the widget, so if you want a helpful widget look for a different app. Also, at least 75% of the app is behind a pay wall.

KXYTAZKT â€œWorm in Another Worldâ€,Functional,What has Finch become? - Battle pass that needs plus subscription to get certain items unobtainable by free players - Battle pass items are one time exclusives and never rerun - Drops determined by chests which are RNG gambling like a gacha - Half the shop is for Plus members only - No regional Plus pricing Are you devs really sure this is a self care app? GREEDY devs. I can't believe this. They also INCREASED the price for Plus as well. All you lot just want to monetize mental health.,1.0

Andersen Macleod,Functional,"This app is fully missing the context of which it is highlighting words to give you positive and or negative feedback that it tracks on a daily basis.

Anna,Functional,"I loved this app untill I just didn't have time to go on it and I started hating it ,it made me feel childish. Its so easy to cheat and not do the tasks so I thought whats the point this is also the case for others also it's quite expensive to get plus",1.0
Xenon,Functional,I loved this app and paid for the membership for a long time but have been treated very badly by support by an issue they acknowledged was on their end.

Jael,Functional,I thought the app was great and then my sis downloaded it I don't care the she cooped me it was that she is so lazy she layed in bed and just checked everything off so she could get better pets and now I don't understand the meaning of the game WHAT IS IT JUST to get pet now my sister is 400 lb lb and the only reason she stopped working out is because she was too busy upgrading her pet I just don't wanna see my like that now she is in the hospital upgrading her pet about to die jk,1.0

AKA Beeks,Functional,"Downgraded rating as free trial ended and now see how hard they push the premium. This is an app aimed at improving kids' mental health, the most useful features are behind a paywall. The message is that they deserve premium to help them feel better.

It had all the pride flags (that I know of) and it even had pride shirts. However it didn't have a the star spangled banner. Not only did it not have the American flag it didn't have the flag of any other country. I will get this app again and rait it five stars if it will put in the the flag that represents my pride of america.,1.0

Gia Zeries,Functional,"Still really like the app but was recently shocked when I went to get a subscription as I had finally saved up enough money and found the price had jumped from 40.00 for a year to 120.00!

I really hope they don't take away things from the free version.",2.0
Cleta H.,Functional,"I love this app!! It's making my self care a LOT easier. The daily goals are one of the best features on here. Just waiting patiently for the next update with the Pride Month and hippie clothes. EDIT: The app was really good for the almost two years I used it.

Nate â€œof the Living Deadâ€,Functional,"Lots of features that actively aggravate certain conditions make this pretty much unusable for me. The constant push to buy premium, the ""season pass,"" the shop with rotating items.

Wish I could leave a positive review because clearly it is helping people, can't relate though",2.0
C V,Functional,I used to love this app. The bird is cute. The prompts helped me write out my thoughts and got me thinking about things. It was very useful and I loved it. Then they started adding all this other stuff to it about a year ago. As a person who was struggling hard with anxiety all these extra features just gave me more anxiety and I felt the same kind of anxious pressure I got from having tests or assignments deadlines because there was so much to do. Tried it again today - it was even worse. ;_;,2.0

Amelia LeBaron,Functional,"The idea of the app is great, and I loved it at first, but there were repeatedly problems with the app that made it hard to use. One time the app deleted all of my journies. Most recently, the app deleted all of my tree town neighbors so I can't see them though they can still come to me. I also ran out of stuff to do because I didn't want to get the premium subscription and you can't really buy anything without it at a point. It really helped motivate for a few months though, and it can be free.",2.0

Everything's so bright and too loud, the pop-ups are stressful, and I feel much more disconnected. You can't turn anything off. I wanted a self care game, this is not that:(",2.0
Danielle Crilley,Functional,"I used to love this app. I even bought a year's subscription to it. The reasons why I'm giving this 2 stars are that the app suddenly stopped working earlier today when I tried to sync my email to my account. It freezes and crashes, and restarting my phone and force stopping the app didn't help. The second reason is lesser but still important. Everything is too expensive to buy in the virtual store, and it spoils the fun.",2.0
Manda Moore,Functional,"I loved this app; however, the ""backup"" feature doesn't work as it should. It saves a copy of your save data to internal storage instead of to your Google backup account.

Margaret Dow,Functional,"I have truly enjoyed using this app, but the most recent update has messed with how the days work. I set my waking hours to coincide with my work schedule (overnights) and I was able to keep my goals for the day over the midnight 'rollover'.

Jesse Leija,Functional,"A friend recommended this to me, and I really tried to enjoy it, but I just couldn't. I dealt with constant slowdown and performance issues, which made me feel more frustrated than happy with my virtual pet.

It's extremely cute; but I wish it was better optimized and better designed.",2.0
Victoria Bage,Functional,"Has potential, very cute, but all of the stuff that seems actually helpful is part of the paid version, it is not cute or helpful enough to pay $40 at once for only a year. The items that seem helpful now, may not even be that helpful upon purchase if going off of the disappointment of the limited free items. Maybe a $10 one time purchase for unlimited access to the app, but i don't even pay the duolingo yearly sub and that is more helpful. Uninstalled.",2.0
Jackie Chambliss,Functional,"I was thoroughly enjoying the app, however, this came crashing down when the terms of the trial were not upheld. I was told there would be 2day notice before the end of the 7day Plus trial so I might cancel before being charged. Not only was I not notified, I was charged $80 two days before the end of my trial. The only reason I wasn't charged was because of insufficient funds. I am heartbroken that a self improvement app would employ such shady practices. :( Would be 1star but I do like the app",2.0
Giorgos Semertsidis,Functional,"This app is really nice, and it provides you with very cute and nice activities. Although the free version is very limited, and you have to pay A LOT if you want the full experience. Even though the cheaper option is close to 4 euros per month, you have to pay for a full year, which I think is too much for a single app. Hence the two stars. If it was one-time buy, I would be very happy to pay max 10-15 euros.",2.0
Carter Mayar,Functional,I truly do like this app and it has helped me out a lot but it can also be pretty pressuring because if you miss one day your no behind one and that just continues which makes it very frustrating for me in particular due to my OCD and Perfectionist personality. I would also recommend buying Finch Plus because otherwise almost everything is locked off.,2.0
Frankie4BJJ,Functional,"Lots of interesting things to do on the app. I wanted to enjoy it but now I see it's more catered to political issues. I say that only through seeing something as silly as a customization option. You have several different pride flags to choose from but no flags for different points of views let alone countries. If I were a company, why bother risking dividing a customer base and just leave things like that out, or include all values?",2.0
Christopher Clinton,Functional,"Cute app, but for me it is more for entertainment than practical. Not good for ADHD or focusing goals...very distracting and designed more for addiction behavior than growth.

David Needham,Functional,"Maybe it's just not made for me, but I don't feel like it helps me with any of the goals I set out to do.

Jo L,Functional,I took a break from Finch and when I came back it had turned into a Mega Premium app which is too expensive for the average person and has locked content I'd previously unlocked. You get asked to subscribe daily! Â£70 (or Â£50 if you say you can't afford it). I don't pay over Â£30 per year for apps. It's not got enough depth to the wellbeing aspect to justify the extra expense. It's more of a game now. Price needs lowering.,2.0
Victoria Bitner,Functional,"I've been using this app for over a year and truly love it. I'm so sad that I can't give it the 5 stars it deserves. They claim to have a ""no questions asked"" refund policy. However, when I paid for plus, my young son decided to try it too. He paid the $40 out of his birthday money and then found he didn't use it as much as he thought he would. He contacted them for his refund and was given the run around. Not only did they never refund his money, I just saw that he has been charged again!",2.0
Kate DH,Functional,"Cute but fiddly to set tasks. Over crowded with buttons and options on the UI which is distracting and stressful. Also the goals where you are asked to list what's making you happy, sad etc all go onto one list so it looks like they are all impacting you the same way. Not sure if that's an error maybe?(Example you enter what's weighing you down.. Then go to enter what makes you happy and it goes onto the same list. This then shows all as negative impact.)",2.0

Random Person,Functional,"Well, I mean for the first while it's fine, but you're asked the same questions over and over and frequently, you do have the same answers. Also, you start to get lazy and it's hard to be bothered about it. Despite this, Finch is very good at the start.",2.0
Mario Gastegger,Functional,edit: the app is even with animations turned off terribly laggy... on the flagship device... there has to be something you can do about it.... try layout recycling on android,2.0
LeAnndra Pettit,Functional,I was really enjoying this app in the beginning and grew to love it more and more but when I finally went to go purchase a year subscription it was an asinine amount of money. Not even sure how long I will keep this app due to the fact that you get access to very limited amount of things and if you can't afford the year or even month to month then the app loses a lot of the appeal to me. I know a lot of work went into it and people need money but it's not much help if people can't subscribe.,2.0
Valerie Lawson,Functional,"In theroy this app could have helped me a lot. The goals, the way it's cute and encouraging. Unfortunately ever since I downloaded my phone is randomly opening websites, similar to pop up ads back in the day. Stopping what I'm working on or watching to redirect to me to random sites or opening my other apps. Like Play store. I honestly feel like it's using fake play store to gather people's info. Payment types. I'm definitely deleting it.",2.0
C B,Functional,"This game is very helpful, but it does not stop pushing for more money. I'm willing to pay $6 a month for the app; it feels like a good enough service for that price. However, as this app is light on content, I expect my $6 to be enough. Instead, I get constant popups to pay even more every month to sponsor someone else's premium subscription, with my bird repeatedly telling me how much she would like it if I spent more money. It feels sleezy from a mental health app. I'm about ready to cancel.",2.0
river,Functional,"I just updated the app after my previous time playing (204 levels of friendship) and all my levels are gone! Updated edit: I re downloaded the app for a second chance as I loved it, and i can't even log in. I used my email and it didn't accept the one I used. I am enraged.",2.0

Maybe lower the price?",2.0
Samantha Villamor,Functional,"I used to love this app. I bought a year of plus and recommended to a few friends. Feels like the devs lost sight of original purpose for the app. The changes that have been made over the last year, especially the last 6 months or so have just proven that it's becoming more game centered than actual ""mental health"" app. The events and micropets were fun but are now overdone and feel forced. The loud few are definitely more influential than the silent majority, especially on the fb group.",2.0
Rose Aivilo,Functional,"I got a subscription in December 2022 and haven't been able to use it since the February 2023 beta glitch.

Edmundo Elizondo,Functional,"Downloaded de apps months ago. Today I felt so ""sheep"", I can't sleep right now.

This gave me anxiety, and a letdown that I may leave the finch alone as idk what I should do; seems it's sleeping, but what now?

Kim Rich (The Crystal Healing Well),Functional,"It's cool and helps you track mood and whatnot.

Your self care literally guilt trips you.",2.0
Saga Sundelin,Functional,It's a cute idea but UI is really confusing. The colors are too similar and important buttons end up blending in with other assets.,2.0
Mari Frost,Functional,"The app itself is good, I like the simplicity to it, I'm not the most mindful person who reflects easily so the small options are good, albeit sometimes I find the questions a bit weird. My biggest bug bear is the incessant notifications! The app sends way too many, I don't want 4-5 a day. I wish there was the option to limit the number or the reasons for notifications.

Rachel Stirling,Functional,Updated to add: I was offered an in-app trial of the plus paid version (I already did the free 7 day trial but it offered me a 30 day free trial when I gave feedback that the plus version was too expensive). I clicked for the trial and it immediately charged my card for a year of plus and when I contacted Finch about the error I got no response.

Bethany,Functional,"I've been really enjoying this app and I have even recommended for some of my loved ones. I will update my review after the first month, for now it has been a few days.

There's no games (which I feel would help a lot), there's no type of advice for situations in life or even in general besides ""breathing tips"" and that's not that useful. Just not working for many reasons",2.0
Ya Onkel Dare,Functional,"I got this app while experiencing a mental health crisis, and since then, I've been using it almost everyday, it's been really helpful! But, what really upset me were the UI changes in recent updates, hence why I've been using version 3.29 for the longest time, but the app has recently shown me an ""Outdated Finch app"" prompt to update; If I update, I'll get all the new items and features, but I'll also get an unintuitive UI I'm not used to. Could you change it back to how it looked previously?",2.0
Amethyst,Functional,"Started, but am Neurodivergent and needed a break from my phone. This has sent me three notifications in the hour since. One of them was at 9pm about winding down. I never set for notifications. The big issue here is lack of customization of alerts. Throwing this all these at us does more to tire out an ND or disabled person than the help it claims to give. I'm frustrated from barely using it.",2.0
Auksas C.,Functional,This app was going very well so far. Isn't pressuring and gives gentle reminders of requested. Simple images to help show mood if you aren't feeling like going in detail. My only issue is I received 1000 or so gems saying happy March and now my clothing store comes up as a grey block and I cannot make any transactions. Not sure how to fix it and worried if I remove the app and reinstall the save data will have saved wrong and I have to start all over again.,2.0
Barb Dalrymple,Functional,"Frustrated with requests to update. I can understand updating an app if it needs to be updated. But when I get to Google store to actually update the app, all it says is I can add this to other devices. I do not plan on putting this on any other devices. Making me go to google store to update the app to find out that no, it does not need to be updated, you just want me to add it to other devices, that is very frustrating and a waste of my time. You have wasted my time 8 times. Fix it.",2.0
Moth Simmons,Functional,If you want your goals in a certain order be prepared to fight the app because it will change it. Reflecting isn't really worth it because it misreads tone all the time. Unless you're willing to simplify the way you write its not worth it. Plus the app is slow and buggy. Devs spend more time looking for ways to get more money than time fixing bugs. As time goes on the app becomes less and less worth using.,2.0
Bradley Donnelly,Functional,"Honestly it's a great idea, but it really feels as if the priority of this app is about profiting off of people that are struggling rather than helping people. Don't get me wrong some of the features are good. Like some first aid. Its quite expensive and some of the features that I think should be free are only for people that pay. I get that you need to make money, but why not make it off the aesthetics, not the features that can really make a difference. So many features are locked. HalfanApp",2.0
Trion,Functional,A lot of paywalls everywhere. Everything has a paywal on it even 5 minute breath exercise. Like it is just a timer.,2.0
Trin Bernal,Functional,"Ever since the update my app has been really bad. The screen is glitched out, I can't access settings or the store. Aspen randomly glitches. I can't see his responses to my responses after an adventure. The game lags. Everything it just really bad. I expected better when I paid nearly 50$ for the year subscription...",2.0
Wendy S (RattlesnakeHaven),Functional,"I don't find it helpful. It stores everything you type, with no option that I can find to delete the files other than to go into each entry and delete the text. If you take the quizzes, it saves the results and displays them, apparently permanently. I couldn't find any way to delete the results. Phones don't have unlimited storage capacity and it wouldn't take long for this app to become huge. The breathing exercises are pretty random. Might have a placebo effect on particularly suggestible folks. There's a mood tracking thing, but I honestly can't comprehend being so self-absorbed that I consider my moods to be historic events worth making a permanent record of. Maybe that's why the app doesn't seem useful to me. The journal prompts are also all about moods and feelings, so not useful if you're not super self-absorbed. If you need to be reminded to brush your teeth and do the laundry, or if you're really self-absorbed and want to immortalize your every mood, and be able to review it on your phone all the time, go for it. Otherwise, it's a cute little cartoon bird that unfortunately will cease being cute and start to talk like a cognitive behavioral therapist as he grows up.",2.0
Jennifer Rossiter,Functional,"Maybe it was just me but it seemed to have the time of day completely wrong (my ""8am"" morning notification was at 2am!) - I assume it's because maybe the app is based in another timezone but I couldn't find any way in settings to change the time (my phone time is correct). It's a shame because I've read great reviews but I really don't want to be woken up at 2am with demands to do jumping jacks!",2.0
Unigamer derp,Functional,"Was okay for a while. But to the more I continued on it seems the buddy I have doesn't interact with me as much. Do I was just stuck with doing tasks. And didn't have any conversations with my buddy. I also was checking on whether or not the app was collecting my databut it didn't have the usual checklist that most apps have that tells you if they give them to third party's, collect data, or if you are allowed to ask for your data to be deleted. Will probably not play this again.",2.0
Joseph Viramontez,Functional,I like the all but it's a little concerning that it advertises in app a 3$ monthly subscription but there is zero way to edit it. I love the premium versions but I don't think I'm ready to commit to this for a while year. The only way this app is truly worth it is with a premium subscription. It helps me but I don't want to pay for a whole year.,2.0
Jaime Card,Functional,"I was enjoying the app until I tried opening it moments ago and for some unknown reason the data corrupted and even though I am subscribed to the plus, I no longer have access to the plus features. When I try to, I am prompted to try the free trial, and it will not let me, because as I already mentioned, I am already subscribed. So. That's pretty wack.",2.0
Nicole Leigh,Functional,"Love the app itself, however, there's no internal backup so if for any reason something happens (including the app itself freezing up), and you haven't back up to an external personal drive.... your info and all your progress is now gone. Extremely devastating when we're talking about self care app that's supposed to help make your life more manageable, not more stressful.",2.0
J Anne,Functional,"I liked the daily goals, but its impossible to put the notifications on silent. I spent 3 days telling the app to notify me silently instead of alerts, and it would ""make"" a new alert for every interaction, that would disturb me several times a day. The app ended up having a list of repeating alerts (ex:Finn had woken up! 4x) and I would have to mute them daily, like a game of wack_a_mole. I had to uninstall",2.0
Tracy Grace,Functional,"Not great. Requies a lot of time and is very distracting from actually getting things done. The store is frustrating and only let's you ""buy"" things for your avatar at certain times. You already had to earn the diamonds and now you can't even use them? Stupid. The info and tasks are too all over the place and you end up spending more time clicking all over the place instead of doing the things you need to do. The reflection questions are good but it was not the right app for me.",2.0
Heather Butler,Functional,"The free version is ""ok"". Not all that is offered works though so I definitely won't upgrade to the paid service. I clicked ""snooze"" for another day on daily goal but the next day it wasn't there and daily goals aren't consistently appearing on suggested to do list. The positive quotes are nice.",2.0
Michael Sacco-Gibson,Functional,"Was a 5 because I was finding tremendous success in maintaining self care and mindfulness. Then the app tried to trick me into sharing an invite link to my phone contacts. I caught it fairly early, so I don't know what final confirmations look like, but it doesn't feel super cool.",2.0
Amber Stovall,Functional,"I have been using this app for almost a year and I really do like it, BUT there's been some changes I am not a fan of. It would appear that now there are really cute seasonal outfits and decor items that you only get if you are a premium member. They never became available to purchase in the little shops and we were never ""gifted"" them. This doesn't make me want to become a premium member, it just makes me not want to use the app.",2.0
Mary Dooley,Functional,"I have been really enjoying this app, but lately it has been glitching and ""restarting"" my day the second or third time I open the app and clearing all my goals for the day (incorrectly shows all goals as completed). The day counter and opening prompt list the correct day, but ""upcoming goals"" shows the app 2 days behind. Please advise.",2.0
Peppermint Ghost,Functional,"This is all in the free version I think it has good intentions, for that I give 2 stars, but it's a very stressful and infuriating app very ironically. Initially you don't know your way around but eventually find a wardrobe and think ""oh this actually will probably make me feel better"" but you actually can't get any of the items and it will take about a month to collect enough 'rainbow stones' and wait for the item you want to come into shop Mainly wish the finch was more interactiveoutofspace",2.0
â€¢ Nightly Baguette â€¢,Functional,"It's a good app but when advertized on platforms i've seen, there is no mention of subsriptions, when I downloaded I truly believed that this was a free mental health/self care app, the subscription is too much for me and probably others who really need or want this kind of helpful app, maybe if you shown in advertising it had a subscription before downloading would be nice.",2.0
Allison MacSwan,Functional,"I used to really love this app. It helped me build habits to be more grounded and mindful. I paid for premium also, mostly to support it because it's such an awesome idea. But they kept adding things that made it start feeling like a cash grab. I was already paying for it but now there's stores with shops to buy Finch clothes, decorations for their house, and more. They really shove it in your face too. I don't care about buying these Finch clothes, I just want to do my thing. Uninstalled.",2.0
Super Beast,Functional,"the app is... cute. the one pro: it analyses your moods and thoughts and gives you a breakdown of what makes you feel good and bad, but this is inescapably dependent on the user's constant and consistent data entry. cons: relaxing sounds functionality doesnt work. there is very little content. planning tools aren't adequately detailed. dressing them up and decorating their bedroom is basically all you can do with your birb. my suggestion: rebrand it for kids and early teens.",2.0
Lunar Weirdo,Functional,I removed a duplicate journey that had only one goal and half my journeys and all my accessories disappeared. ðŸ˜§ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜,2.0
Kaine Faldon,Functional,"I love the app, even though I have to stay free because I can't afford premium. However, it is very frustrating when I was expressing gratitude for my heated blanket, said I would be miserable without it; because I said 'miserable' the app said it was negative. Edit: I take it back. This apps reflections can't tell whether a post is good or bad at all. I typed out a heated rant, and the app says it was a positive reflection. It's not. I'm pissed. Don't tell me I'm trending positive.",2.0
Kala Caldwell,Functional,"Good at first until you wanted to end your subscription, they make it sound easy but I have been fighting with it, and now they won't stop trying to pull out money for a 2nd time when I have already messaged the creators to end my subscription, this app as literally taken money from our account that we have needed, and I am still fighting with it because I can't figure out now how to make it go away, I can't even sign back in because I have ended my account and it doesn't not recognize my email.",2.0
K E,Functional,"Could be much better. First of all, Finch's incentive system is, kind of annoying. You gain points very slowly, which would be ok, but everything in the shop is super expensive. Also dumb, you have limited access to a random assortment of dress items for your birdie so you have to buy from the few items you see or wait until what you want shows up by chance. With how slowly you gain points, coins, all items should be available. Without finch+ you can't set goals for sleep or exercise. Dumb",2.0
Kailyn Blackford,Functional,I loved the app until I added verification to get into the app. After I did that the app completely stopped working. Every time I tried to go onto the app the app either stopped or restarted before I could verify myself. I had only gotton to use it for a few hours. Overall if this glitch was fixed I'd give this 4 or 5 stars because it worked well and was motivational and fun!,2.0
Tonya Medrano,Functional,"This is in responses to the finch developer who answered my review. There was nothing in the app settings that says ""time capsule"" or recovery or anything like that. There is a ""save file"" which I had done daily with my original PAID finch account. But no way to recover it after. It doesn't say where it was saved. For someone like me who has multiple issues this is very defeating & discouraging. Especially when I spent money. If you can recover my account you should contact me. I sent emails",2.0
Nina Greer,Functional,This app was 5 star amazing therapeutically and added a cuteness to make it fun. Now it's all about logging in to get prizes adding friends to get bonus micropets it's becoming more stressful than therapeutic. That needs to stop. We should not have to add strangers to get exclusive items especially when we pay for premium. I'll say it again get rid of the competitive need to have friends. Go back to being therapeutic I won't be signing up again if this becomes a competition. Do better Finch,2.0
Valarie Boddy,Functional,"Great app, bad update. I love this app, it's helped a good amount with my mental health and my headspaces. This new update however, really sucks. I can't use it like I could, the background is blue when it shouldn't be and I have difficulty adding entries or whatever.",2.0
Mary Eva,Functional,This app is cute but as a long term depression sufferer this seems like something meant for people with a random anxiety attack. It has quick exercises ie breathing for panic and journaling prompts. I wish I could say it helped me too like everyone else raving about it but it didn't.,2.0
Sean Locke,Functional,"A promising app, very encouraging in general and the finch character is really cute. However: The dealbreaker for me is notifications. I don't use Alert notifications for most apps since it's very distracting, but I *do* want an unobtrusive visual reminder to look at the Finch app - hence setting notifications to Silent. Setting notifications to Silent doesn't actually work for this app, though. You can set a notification to Silent, but the next time that event occurs a new notification with the same name gets created. This ""new"" notification type defaults to the Alert type notification. The last thing I want in a self-care app is for it to distract me from my work. I had to uninstall. I might reconsider/improve my review if the devs sort out this notification problem.",2.0
Matt Ludwig,Functional,"Was useful at first, but persistent performance issues, continual pushing of the subscription service, and increasing addition of FOMO elements have undermined its utility as a self-care app. Haven't used it in weeks, probably won't again.",2.0
Bessie Ish,Functional,*edit: its now been a month since this problem started.* I loved this app until about 2 days ago when it started malfunctioning and started saying i had missed logging my moods.

Jackie Chambliss,Functional,"I was thoroughly enjoying the app, however, this came crashing down when the terms of the trial were not upheld. I was told there would be 2day notice before the end of the 7day Plus trial so I might cancel before being charged. Not only was I not notified, I was charged $80 two days before the end of my trial. The only reason I wasn't charged was because of insufficient funds. I am heartbroken that a self improvement app would employ such shady practices. :( Would be 1star but I do like the app",2.0

He paid the $40 out of his birthday money and then found he didn't use it as much as he thought he would. He contacted them for his refund and was given the run around.

Although the free version is very limited, and you have to pay A LOT if you want the full experience. Even though the cheaper option is close to 4 euros per month, you have to pay for a full year, which I think is too much for a single app. Hence the two stars. If it was one-time buy, I would be very happy to pay max 10-15 euros.",2.0
Carter Mayar,Functional,I truly do like this app and it has helped me out a lot but it can also be pretty pressuring because if you miss one day your no behind one and that just continues which makes it very frustrating for me in particular due to my OCD and Perfectionist personality.

Frankie4BJJ,Functional,"Lots of interesting things to do on the app. I wanted to enjoy it but now I see it's more catered to political issues.

Jo L,Functional,I took a break from Finch and when I came back it had turned into a Mega Premium app which is too expensive for the average person and has locked content I'd previously unlocked. You get asked to subscribe daily! Â£70 (or Â£50 if you say you can't afford it). I don't pay over Â£30 per year for apps. It's not got enough depth to the wellbeing aspect to justify the extra expense. It's more of a game now. Price needs lowering.,2.0

C B,Functional,"This game is very helpful, but it does not stop pushing for more money. I'm willing to pay $6 a month for the app; it feels like a good enough service for that price. However, as this app is light on content, I expect my $6 to be enough.

LeAnndra Pettit,Functional,I was really enjoying this app in the beginning and grew to love it more and more but when I finally went to go purchase a year subscription it was an asinine amount of money. Not even sure how long I will keep this app due to the fact that you get access to very limited amount of things and if you can't afford the year or even month to month then the app loses a lot of the appeal to me. I know a lot of work went into it and people need money but it's not much help if people can't subscribe.,2.0

Cleta H.,Functional,"I love this app!! It's making my self care a LOT easier. The daily goals are one of the best features on here. Just waiting patiently for the next update with the Pride Month and hippie clothes. EDIT: The app was really good for the almost two years I used it. Now there have been significant changes, the most important the boost in subscription fees. They've almost doubled overnight. I feel like it's more a cash grab.",2.0
E S,Functional,"Not great if you're the wrong kind of disabled. It's not BAD, as such, but it's relentless positivity and attitude are not healthy if there's something physically wrong causing issues. Depends on your tollerence for it. I found it annoying. You may enjoy it.",2.0
Panteha Hamidi,Functional,"While I greatly enjoy the new artworks appearing everytime I open the app. I don't really like daily affirmation, at least with the quotes there was a chance of finding someone you relate to from time to time. But daily affirmation are not for everybody, I personally find them forceful. . . Update: I dislike daily affirmations even more now.",2.0
Gia Zeries,Functional,"Still really like the app but was recently shocked when I went to get a subscription as I had finally saved up enough money and found the price had jumped from 40.00 for a year to 120.00! It's really upsetting to be barred entry because I am poor, and I am not sure the few extras I've seen in free trial mode justify the hike. I really hope they don't take away things from the free version.",2.0
Amy,Functional,I honestly find this app useful but overwhelming to keep up with your set tasks and to take care of the pet but it can can be fun though it's just overwhelming,2.0
Kim Rich (The Crystal Healing Well),Functional,"It's cool and helps you track mood and whatnot. Here's the thing though, you better check in everyday or you might not get to hatch your micropets and the eggs are just gone. Which, if you ask me, is a horrible way to help people feel better. Your self care literally guilt trips you.",2.0
Lucius Aurelius,Functional,"Okay. Even with the animations reduced, my app runs incredibly slowly and there's a *massive* lag anytime I tap something. Furthermore, I really relied on those quotes to give me perspective each day. Replacing them with affirmations has made me really sad because I don't really get anything from them. I feel more discouraged/patronized reading them.. I find that affirmations really only work if they're specific to what you need. If they're given vaguely, it feels more like a jab. :(",2.0
logibbous,Functional,"it's pretty cute and helpful, but it keeps shoving Plus down my throat. it gives me panic attacks at this point. the devs are also VERY silent on every review that comments on that. devs, if you're reading this, please stop with all the plus stuff. I understand you like money, we do too, but we like self care more. you really have something good going here and I wish you'd talk to us about this.",2.0
Super Beast,Functional,"the app is... cute. the one pro: it analyses your moods and thoughts and gives you a breakdown of what makes you feel good and bad, but this is inescapably dependent on the user's constant and consistent data entry. cons: relaxing sounds functionality doesnt work. there is very little content. planning tools aren't adequately detailed. dressing them up and decorating their bedroom is basically all you can do with your birb. my suggestion: rebrand it for kids and early teens.",2.0
Elissa,Functional,"It's really helpful but I feel like it's not working well technology wise. I've had someone use my invite code and it doesn't show in the rewards page where you get things if you invite friends. I also have to keep adding a personal goal and every time I mark it to repeat daily with a reminder and every day the goal disappears. I'm torn on if I'll keep the app or not. Super cute and motivating but seems idk, buggy?",2.0
Celestial Star,Functional,"It's a good idea but kind of poor execution. I struggle to take care of myself, so taking care of a virtual bird is even more difficult, especially because I'm not receiving much in return. There no motivation to use it, the finch just collects clothing and furniture and goes on walks. There's no games (which I feel would help a lot), there's no type of advice for situations in life or even in general besides ""breathing tips"" and that's not that useful. Just not working for many reasons",2.0
Nate Lottes,Functional,This is an excellent idea but the implementation is just not there. There's way too much emphasis on getting other people to sign up and not enough emphasis on making the app actually usable.,2.0
Tanja Bauer,Functional,"I'm all new to it and while it's a lovely concept, there are WAY too many features and no guide to understand it. It seems more like a pay for play therapy game than a self help app. I don't like that you get 2 minutes/slides to understand it and then 100 options to chose from which little to no explanation. I have adhd and that alone males this app useless to me",2.0
James McMorrow Jr,Functional,Fix the widget! Used to fit just fine on my pixel 7 pro and now it's too big for the home screen,2.0
Allison MacSwan,Functional,"I used to really love this app. It helped me build habits to be more grounded and mindful. I paid for premium also, mostly to support it because it's such an awesome idea. But they kept adding things that made it start feeling like a cash grab. I was already paying for it but now there's stores with shops to buy Finch clothes, decorations for their house, and more. They really shove it in your face too. I don't care about buying these Finch clothes, I just want to do my thing. Uninstalled.",2.0
Shion Sanada,Functional,i like my little Finch. im startin to be quite annoyed. ur system reset my progress. i lost progress. it asked me to sign in n now ive lost days n a micto pet. n the one it has saved should hav been grown,2.0
Heather B,Functional,"The overall app is great but it shows me trending down due to key words it sees as ""negative"" . As someone who works in medicine, I wrote about a drug calculation and it had me in a negative trend because I talked about drugs. Same thing happened when I said it was a great feeling not to feel hate towards my ex. It picked up hate and marked me as negative. I won't be using the writing prompts anymore as it makes the data inaccurate",2.0
Erin Porter,Functional,"The app doesn't really help with my anxiety. It like kind of just annoys me honestly. The prompts to write about suck. One said what actions do you associate to dinner foods or something like that. When it asks you how you are feeling, when you open the app, I answer but I feel like it doesn't really do anything. To be honest, I really only use this app to level up my bird or whatever it's called, and the only other reason I use the app is to send vibes or whatever back and forth with my cousin.",2.0
KuroDame,Functional,It's cute and the idea is nice but this app has no business being as laggy as it is for such a simple app. Not to mention how pricy it is for the concept of mental health.,2.0
Piper Alexander,Functional,it is a very good app and i had it before but even tho i saved my progress into a file it wont let me recover it and now i have to start all over,2.0
Gary P,Functional,I would have preferred more customization on the daily tasks to do. The GUI was not intuitive. Gave it a shot and not for me. Told my finch I was going out for milk and cigarettes.,2.0
Nina Greer,Functional,This app was 5 star amazing therapeutically and added a cuteness to make it fun. Now it's all about logging in to get prizes adding friends to get bonus micropets it's becoming more stressful than therapeutic. That needs to stop. We should not have to add strangers to get exclusive items especially when we pay for premium. I'll say it again get rid of the competitive need to have friends. Go back to being therapeutic I won't be signing up again if this becomes a competition. Do better Finch,2.0
V Crowley,Functional,"When i need this to keep track of self-care, mood .. thats 1 part caused by my financial situation... and expected to pay.. yeah, no",2.0
Kordell Martindale,Functional,"It's ok but not great. Nothing really makes you excited about trying to work on yourself like a pop-up saying, we care about you but to continue working on yourself is gonna cost you $45 a month. Uninstalled and disappointed as was actually interested in trying, but not when I'm gonna be repeatedly asked to pay for the service after a week, and to unlock what looked like a mental health battlepass.....glad to see capitalism still gives no cares about mental health unless a dime can be made.",2.0
Amanda Hatfield,Functional,"Normally it's a great app, but I have noticed an issue with the monthly thing and the energy things. For the monthly reward thing, it sets me back a few days even though I did them. Also, it (daily energy things) will randomly put me one or two points lower than I should be. That is easy for me to fix but it's kind of annoying...",3.0
Lauren Laibach,Functional,"Update: the app has gotten really busy with recent updates, and I feel that all the events/prompts/visitors/outfits/items distract from the central goal of it being a place to tune in and show up for yourself. Way too much for me, so I've stopped using it daily. Original: Such a fun take on a self-care app. I love the flexibility of writing reflections, and there's a lot you can do with the free version. Having the practice of self care embodied in a little bird buddy keeps me coming back.",3.0
Therese Septimo,Functional,"The idea of the app is great. It's like a Tamagochi, but this time, it takes care of YOU. I LOVED the app. The daily reminders, journeys, and exercises help a lot. I have my own personal space. HOWEVER, the latest update has been SUPER GLITCHY: I have an active plus account, but the 09/05 update deactivated it. CS couldn't figure it out. Now they've gone silent. Automatic syncing doesn't work. Cleared data (day 28), and I was sent back to day 25. I'm now more stressed than before. ðŸ™ƒ",3.0
Gina,Functional,"Sometimes this app is the only reason I remember to take my medication, or to drink more water throughout the day, or to like... think a nice thought here and there. Unfortunately, there's a lot of lag with a lot of its features. Setting a new task or saving a writing prompt will cause the app to freeze for about 30 seconds every time. Switching to the bird's clothing/house tab always causes a similar freeze. I love the app overall, just wish it was less laggy.",3.0
Lost,Functional,"I've been having trouble with the app lately. I have an Android (Galaxy S21+) phone, and the app has been super laggy for me for months--even with nothing else open & 6 GB of RAM available. I can't add new tasks or delete old ones reliably, it takes several minutes to do either, and that's IF the app doesn't crash. Clearing cache hasn't helped either.",3.0
Casper Xallan,Functional,"Good but needs improvement. Best for boring human tasks like making t bed. Has a LOT of functionality. You can record, organize, skip, snooze, & edit goals as well as set timers. The interface is cluttered. Difficult to find things, very busy, not straightforward, colorful, non-intuitive, often overwhelming. The avatar gameplay & goal accomplishing need be separate pages, so you can reach goals & visit your Finch's home separately. Then it's more cause-effect rather than one big deluge.",3.0
Arianne Hutchins,Functional,"I used it last year for a while and it was good, but it plateaued for me. I reinstalled it today and I'm glad there are many updates and more chances to customize. With that said, I feel like almost everything is directing me to pay for the service and it's just not worth the money. Little things like not being able to give me suggestions for daily tasks because they want me to subscribe is irritating. It seems like every new fun aspect stops with a paywall.",3.0
Deanna Webster,Functional,"This cartoony little app is surprisingly helpful in supporting simple and concrete self-care goals like taking time to reflect, sleep, hygiene and stress & time management goals etc. I'm having trouble navigating the more subtle support framework- the icons are vague & not intuitive to me and I can't find any kind of overall primer so I know I'm missing a lot which is frustrating. I do not understand the journeys at all. What am I supposed to be doing? Can't figure out how to assess progress.",3.0
Amanda Newman,Functional,"I originally gave this five stars, and it still is an amazing app. I just wish I could use it. I had some phone trouble, so I synced my account. However, since doing this, I haven't been able to open the app. So far, whenever I try to open it, it either says it's synchronizing forever or it freezes and crashes. Whenever I was able to use it, I loved it and it was really helpful. I'd love to give it 5 stars again, but seeing as I can't use it and am afraid of losing everything...ðŸ˜",3.0
Victoria Bale,Functional,"There is a glitch where tasks are stuck on sort by time. I can toggle the setting but it doesn't change the layout. And goals set for before 9am are in the later today section. I would also appreciate a confirmation for refreshing the store selection for free. I can't count the number of times I've accidentally clicked it & lost access to something I was excited for. Some of the affirmations have weird timing like getting ""Today is a good day to have..."" at bedtime. Otherwise pretty useful app.",3.0
Roses,Functional,"This app is really cute and great for keeping habits! But lately, Every Time my bird goes on a journey I get a full screen pop-up ad trying to get me to buy Finch plus?? It's getting really annoying. I cannot afford Finch plus (w the discount or not). I couldn't afford it yesterday. I won't be able to afford it tomorrow. Continuing to aggressively advertise this feature to dedicated members of the community is really disrupting my experience.",3.0
Madison Morgan,Functional,"It was a great app and I loved how customizable the goal lists could be. The only real downside (and it's a big one) is that the app does not automatically backup any of your data. There is no way to create a free ""account"" to get back into later if you switch phones, which is what I did without realizing this. I had put hours of time into the app on my last phone thinking I'd have access to it forever... Nope. Very disappointed. That needs to be made more clear from the beginning.",3.0
chess,Functional,"i really used to love this app ! it was super helpful ( albeit glitchy at times , though probably more because of my phone than the app itself ) but as of recently , i feel like it's gotten a little worse : / it seems like every time i open the app , i get a pop-up for finch plus , and there's no way to turn it off !! i'm perfectly fine with the free version , i don't NEED plus , and all the ads are getting so pushy ! i still think it's great on it's own , but i wish the pop-ups would stop !",3.0
Kawaii Toast,Functional,"I adore this app, it's been very helpful for me, especially with the recent update where you can have repeating goals. That said, when I am setting reminders for particular times, the time always sets to remind me at AM. If I set a reminder for 12 or 2 PM, it'll automatically set to remind me at 12 or 2 AM instead. This is very frustrating, to say the least.",3.0
Dbomb,Functional,"Wasn't useful enough for me to keep. I liked that it was a cute way reminiscent of tamagochi to put on my phone. I also liked that it suggested a lot of different goals. The user interface wasn't great for me, and there were tons of grammatical errors in the text. One example: when asked to do a morning reflection on why my morning is happy, it said it in the past tense, which was a weird usage given the morning is starting?? It was nice free, but I am just glad I didn't pay for it.",3.0
Sarah Liepins,Functional,"Generally fairly good for keeping track of goals, but does have a few issues. The reflections system has trouble recognizing tone, so I always have to go back and fix it. Would be good if you could set it yourself while writing. Also, there is a huge focus on buying premium and getting the monthly accessories/micropets/etc, despite the app being for mental health. It feels more like an item collecting game than a tracker app sometimes.",3.0
Sam Schoene,Functional,"I love this app, I do. But I'm quite upset with it at the moment. I ran into a bug, i followed the steps on the bug report forum that were suggested. And I lost all of my progress and data. Maybe I messed something up, but I'm quite sad, especially since there aren't any Auto-Backup features and bugs are pretty unpredictable on the user side.",3.0
Jazmin Lanti,Functional,"This app is overwhelming. The excercises that show up on the main page seemingly never end and after everything you do there's a recommendation for something else. I'm afraid to open the app because it's anxiety inducing. If what appears on the main page could be minimized, that'd be helpful to those of us who get anxious when we don't finish what's in front of us. This app is simply stressful for me. It's a great app otherwise, just bloated with stuff that I feel is counterintuitive.",3.0
Defiant Turtle,Functional,"They have become much more pushy with their subscription. The monthly challenge is mildly annoying at best and gives me unnecessary stress and sadness at worst. Being unable to add accents to names in treetown is annoying. Being unable to change the name of someone in treetown unless they also have the app makes it difficult when a person changes their name IRL. All that being said, the activities are very helpful for me. However, I will be searching for a new app.",3.0
HuffleStitch,Functional,"Eddited-recently I've noticed that the day will restart at midnight, where before it went off the set waking hours. It's one thing I loved about this app, I use it to track my meds and work night shift. To take meds at 12. I like this app, it helps with tracking my medicine. I do wish there was a way to undo a completed goal as I accidentally completed the wrong one. I take my meds twice a day and clicked the wrong time. I do also wish there was a dark mode. It's a good app otherwise.",3.0
Alee Allen,Functional,"The idea of this app is really great, and I have friends who use it and like it, but I personally struggle with the interface. Navigating it is really difficult and confusing for me, it just isn't very smooth or easy to find things. That and it doesn't save your data, I had it before and ended up uninstalling it because it was so difficult to navigate, but upon reconsidering and installing it again I couldn't get my old Finch back.",3.0
Alexis Osborne,Functional,"Lovely app. I think the ability to quickly journal throughout the day, being motivated by a little finch to care for, is a pretty wonderful thing to have. The one thing it is lacking for me is the ability to see all my journal entries in one spot. That is the one thing that keeps me going back to my notes app for my real deep reflections. You can see the past day's log, and there is a tag system in play, but it seems to me to be a bit messy. Overall, I still adore my little finch",3.0
Samantha Morrow,Functional,"I love this app and really enjoyed the free trial of the paid subscription. However, although I've tried on two different wireless networks via wifi and also using data, I can't get the app to connect to the Google Play Store so that I can purchase a subscription. Every time I try, it just tells me that it can't connect to the Play Store to offer a plus plan and to restart the app with an active internet connection and try again. I wish it would let me - I'd gladly pay to subscribe to this app!",3.0
Parnita Harsh,Functional,"Really nice idea and would recommend people to try however there are two big issues in my opinion so far: - Dark mode - The goals you set everyday are not entirely curated. You can get repeats the same day, and that same set of goals to choose from can be the same as the next day. They're not really synergistic with each other and feel limited. I'm assuming better goals is locked behind a paywall in addition. The app is not sustainable for free users for a long time, it feels.",3.0
Lex S,Functional,"I got the app mainly for adhd executive function help. As it gamified doing daily tasks, it helped me stay on track. For a little while. After I'd decorated and redecorated my room and changed my finch's outfit a few times, it started to get boring fast and usage dropped off. My friend joined with me and the options for interacting with her in game quickly became repetitive as well. It's a great concept and it looks like it helps neurotypicals w depression a lot. But I needed more.",3.0
Tara,Functional,"I've been enjoying this app. The daily goals help me think positively, and I love my birb. I just want to see her grow happily. The app has alot of issues, enough to uninstall it if you aren't feeling invested in the cute pet concept. Personally, the digital pet idea sets it apart from other apps I've tried before. My complaint is that I've repeatedly attempted to pay for plus. It's pricy, but I've decided to try it anyway since I enjoy it. My payment errors every time. Not declines. Errors.",3.0
Marie,Functional,"Recently started using the app and have noticed a fairly consistent problem with trying to start stretches and exercises. I'm able to shuffle, but was only able to start once! Something just isn't registering when I tap. Nothing wrong with my screen; no issues with tapping in that same area for other things. Can you please investigate this? Update: still a problem, since first reported April 6.",3.0
Sugarbeats321,Functional,"It deleted my review but I'll try again with what I remember. The widget doesn't update unless you interact with it. There's only one widget which is weird for it being a widget app. Sounds play from your notification sounds not your media volume. You can't interact directly with your pet on your own terms, such as feeding or bathing or talking. The clothing selection is very limited, and there's only holiday and beach stuff. There're no games or free quizzes. Has good self care techniques.",3.0
Goldfish,Functional,"B4, 5 stars; I dont like how in your face new subscription service is, or that certain things that may help with my depression/anxiety r locked behind a paid service. I have no problem paying developers, but the ""pay to unlock this"" method feels grimy on an app that wants 2 help with mental illness, + has turned me away from using the app as much. The upd8s r great, but things like Tree Town, etc. would be a better paid feature than the Pessimism quiz that would actually help set goals 2 improve",3.0
Shannon Charlson,Functional,"I have to update my review. I have loved this app for the last few months, and even purchased the Finch Plus account back in March 2022. It was my understanding I didn't need to renew the membership for a year. Yesterday and today, I started getting adds to upgrade to Finch Plus, and when I went to clock on it, it gave me a 7 day trial membership and locked me out of some of the features. If I have to renew Finch Plus this frequently, I think I will look elsewhere for mood tracker apps.",3.0
Kennedy,Functional,"I like the app it's good overall however I kind of wish that they would save your data or maybe have like an automatic save. For instance I accidentally uninstalled the app and now all my progress is gone, I can't email them asking if they can restore my progress because they don't keep the data and I forgot to save a file. Other than that the app itself is really nice but definitely recommend you save your data every now and then or else you'll end up at me starting from the beginning â˜¹ï¸",3.0
Misty Clay,Functional,"Began using this app a few weeks ago. Money has been tight in our household lately, so I wanted to try it for a few weeks before buying Plus. Received a free 7-day Plus trial & really enjoyed the full app, but when I went to upgrade to Plus, the price had increased from $39.99/year to $69.99. The internet tells me that this price increase has been in the works for a while so I trust that it wasn't a blatant bait-and-switch, but for a self-care/mental health app it's really left a bad taste. â˜¹ï¸",3.0
Alexandria,Functional,"Update: My sound within the app does not work at all. I did troubleshoot. All other sound on my phone works.

Jessica Artemis,Functional,"It started off as a 5 star, but over time, there has been a real shift to the premium version getting pushed in the user's face.

If it continues any further, I will uninstall this app. It feels the devs have lost sight and want money",3.0
Shawmu ?,Functional,"Update: While it's still a nice app to journal and track your goals, it's getting increasingly lagger with each update. It's really hard to enjoy this app anymore due to how badly it lags. It also feels very distracting, now. Has way too much going on. - Finch truely has help me tremendously.

Being able to customize their home and looks really helps reel me back in.",3.0
Mel Smith,Functional,"Nice concept, but has some issues. Thinks my anxiety mention is positive. Spells ""excited"" incorrectly. Doesn't seem able to decipher chronic pain, or recent loss. Or account for depression that is currently being tested but still symptomatic. I hid multiple tasks because of this, which left me with few free things to do. May work for some people, but not a good fit for me.",3.0
Nightmare Caster,Functional,Love the app I find myself not using it as much of late because of how many ads to upgrade to finch plus. I know you want to get more people to get plus but some of them seem a bit sneaky like the ones asking if you want to try the trail version of plus normally the no thank you is at the bottom but you put see plans there. Please I'm happy they are all your own ads but they pop up every time I do anything on this app.,3.0
Jacquell Arkis,Functional,While the app is very good- great even. I expected our progress to be connected to our gmails but they aren't. My old phone with all my data broke down and I had hope that it would connect to my gmail like other apps. But it wasn't and I don't have the energy to start all over again since I'd gotten so far. I hope that you guys can make it possible to connect data to your gmail so that this doesn't happen to other people. Other than that this app is perfect ðŸ‘Œ,3.0
Mark D,Functional,"I've been using this regularly for over a year now. It's a fun and inclusive app, but I have the uncomfortable impression that it hasn't helped me feel better that much or even at all.

Tempest Devoe,Functional,"Before today it was a 4, but as I unfortunately have learned while using this app for many months, as your bird grows and gains colors the selection is so tiny and NONE of them match.

Samantha,Functional,This is a very nice app that really serves as a great tool to get my feelings out but having to pay for content is not a great feature in my opinion especially for a self care app. Some of the features that someone may need on a really bad day could be locked because of the pay for all access aspect. That's my only big criticism of the app is that you have to pay for all the the content.,3.0
Willow Dunning,Functional,"Overall its a cute app that could help incentivize people to do self care, my only issue is that the daily adventure you need to energize your bird for takes like 5 goals to do and takes 6-7 hours. I feel like I need to accomplish all my tasks early to get the bird out but that isn't good self care, stuff like ""eating 3 meals"" or ""declutter your desk"" can't be done at 9am. I wish the adventure was shorter so I could space out my self care.",3.0

Cloud Backup,Functional,"Good app (I got the full version for a year from someone). It helps me set goals without the pressure of ""grind culture"". Critique: 1. High paywall. 2. I would love a manual toggle for each animation. I don't mind the walking animation, but the flashing of the light stick hurts, so only turning off one thing would be helpful. 3. I would also like a setting where you can change the word ""human"" (like when the app asks ""How does this goal make you a better human?"") into something else.",3.0
Shannon,Functional,"So far it's been fun but now it asks how I'm feeling every single time I go on it. Is there a way to change that? It's making me not want to to use it it's so annoying.

Tiffany Alyssa,Functional,"*****Update***** I've had this app for 2 yrs now & the experience has been mostly positive, but one thing I'd like to suggest to the dev team would be to allow the users to have some control over the dislike vs like feature.

Holly Cope,Functional,"I love using Finch. It's really helping my to keep on top of my mental health and remember to look after myself. However, I give 3 stars because the app itself can be clunky, glitchy and slow.

The concept itself it amazing but the app does need some improvements.",3.0
jag greene,Functional,"Cool concept, difficult to customize tasks. I wanted an app that would let me work on stretching twice every day, exercising 3 times a week, flossing once a day, and doing a journal every night. However, I was unable to use the app to set this up. Due to some glitches when customizing the focus tab, as well as the difficulty setting up repeated tasks.",3.0
A S,Functional,"Great concept, but the app has some major downsides. For example, soundscapes do not work as supposed to, every time I try to use soundscapes for sleep, they just stop playing in a few minutes time, despite me choosing 8hrs. Also, breathing excercises really need sound prompts, because when one is trying to fall asleep or calm down, it is common to close one's eyes and not look at the screen. I am using paid version, so I won't be paying another month, because it's just not worth the money.",3.0
Rie,Functional,"Edited from 5 stars to 3. Been using it for 3+ months now. I loved the concept and it really helped me get started taking care of my self. HOWEVER, the app started getting too slow. I have to restart the app every few seconds because it's freezing and lagging. It's getting too frustrating when it used to be a relaxing app. Now I find myself skipping ticking all the tasks done because it hangs every few seconds. Considering uninstalling and giving 1 star if it continues to be like that.",3.0
E J,Functional,"The app is useful as a journal and for setting daily goals, and the pet is pretty cute. However, I don't like that it has recently started asking me daily if I want to buy the premium version. Asking every once in a while is fine, but asking this often actively makes me want to buy it less. I also don't like how the store is constantly bombarded with seasonal items, making it near impossible to get any specific items I want (I have been trying to get a purple preppy bow for literal months now).",3.0

Janneke van Grunsven (Ceri),Functional,"Finch is a cute idea, and has a few wonderful tools available. Though for an app that's supposed to help with mental health and support it is rather invasive.

B M,Functional,"it's really cute and does help me feel better throughout the day, to remind me of stuff that I need regular reminders for when I'm low, and for that I'm very grateful. downside: it's very overloaded and overstimulating with all the drops and rewards and points and stats and colours and blinking stuff. it would be much more calming if the app were more muted; as it is, it feels a bit like a cheapish mobile game that just wants you to click everywhere and interact with everything :/",3.0
Rebecca W,Functional,"I thought it was a really good app, the self-care prompts were amazing & my mental health benefitted. I started to lose interest in the monthly ""events"" as they got really repetitive and gimmicky when all I really wanted was the slow, daily progress.

You can record, organize, skip, snooze, & edit goals as well as set timers. The interface is cluttered.

Victoria Bale,Functional,"There is a glitch where tasks are stuck on sort by time. I can toggle the setting but it doesn't change the layout. And goals set for before 9am are in the later today section. I would also appreciate a confirmation for refreshing the store selection for free. I can't count the number of times I've accidentally clicked it & lost access to something I was excited for. Some of the affirmations have weird timing like getting ""Today is a good day to have..."" at bedtime. Otherwise pretty useful app.",3.0
Lilly Nikolov,Functional,"I love my bird skrimppol so much.This is so addictive edit:after 6 months of having this app, I've lost all motivation, I still adore skrimppol but I forget about the app and don't fill in the goals.But I also have ADHD and I lose interest in things easily so this might just be a me problem.Edit:are they just not reading reviews?!?!I keep seeing steph & nico and instead trying to help them they copy and paste the same bs and sometimes reply to critical reviews as if they're in support?!? W h a t",3.0
Chris Lace,Functional,It's a great app but I don't agree with subscription based memberships. It should just be a one off purchase. It has no need charging me Â£41.49 (or Â£70.99) every year to use membership. Just make it a one off purchase. I don't get this subscription trend at all.,3.0
J Denning,Functional,"The app is cute and helpful....until I saw the micropets ""pronouns"". ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!! This sickens 99% of us, so why cater to freaks when it just alienates so many others? They/them can simply exist without all this ridiculousness.",3.0
Laura Olivia,Functional,"I reinstalled Finch and while I still think it's a cute app, all the interface has changed for me. All plain white...no colour coded goals, or reflection entry keywords, it's just a bit boring and not stimulating to use. I can't look over past reflections, which I find very unhelpful. I have the premium, honestly don't think it's worth the money, except for the fact that content is locked without it. I'm using it less and less, not finding motivation to set goals at all anymore. Its a game now.",3.0
Start From Scratch,Functional,This is awesome i used it for about a year until it bugged out and deleted all my progress. I Uninstaller and now 2 years later I'm about to install it again! It loses stars though because of a year's work gone but my phone was really buggy at the time so I don't think it was the apps fault.,3.0
Abby Gibson,Functional,I love it but they need to give more opportunities to the people that can't have premium,3.0
Buffy Geek,Functional,"I'm giving it three stars because I signed up for the free trial, canceled it, and my account got charged the full amount, anyway. DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THE FREE TRIAL IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE PAID VERSION. Otherwise, the app is amazing. It would have gotten five stars if it hadn't robbed me.",3.0
Amanda Newman,Functional,"I originally gave this five stars, and it still is an amazing app. I just wish I could use it. I had some phone trouble, so I synced my account. However, since doing this, I haven't been able to open the app. So far, whenever I try to open it, it either says it's synchronizing forever or it freezes and crashes. Whenever I was able to use it, I loved it and it was really helpful. I'd love to give it 5 stars again, but seeing as I can't use it and am afraid of losing everything...ðŸ˜",3.0
Roses,Functional,"This app is really cute and great for keeping habits! But lately, Every Time my bird goes on a journey I get a full screen pop-up ad trying to get me to buy Finch plus?? It's getting really annoying. I cannot afford Finch plus (w the discount or not). I couldn't afford it yesterday. I won't be able to afford it tomorrow. Continuing to aggressively advertise this feature to dedicated members of the community is really disrupting my experience.",3.0
Michael Johnson,Functional,it's great and I appreciate the guardians e who made it possible for me to enjoy the finch plus but it's demeaning to have to watch others with it all the time when those of us who struggle just to eat can't get it unless someone else pays for it,3.0
Omega Wolf,Functional,I'm so upset. I had finch for a while but I deleted it because I needed space on my phone. I have a new phone now and wanted my bird back only to discover everything is different and my email is somehow no longer attached to my finch!! Oliver is gone! All my micro pets are gone! Everything! I want to cry... I missed my bird and now I don't think I'll ever see him again... I don't even want to restart. I want MY finch back... It was great when I had it. He helped me through my depression...,3.0
foxlox_yt 99,Functional,fantastic untill all your data and items gets erased for no reason. there should be a button to try and gain back lost data.,3.0
pink grape,Functional,"The app is nice, but I can't afford the payment and I don't want a free trial just for 7 days, other than that, the app is really good.",3.0
kiratsukiie,Functional,The only reason i vote this three stars is because of the audio. My media volume is all the way up and only when i open it for a few seconds thats when i can hear something. I tried to uninstall it and it did nothing. My in game sound volume is up too. Whats going on?!?!,3.0
Sarah W,Functional,"Glitchy since update. Even before update, updating goals, especially updating the hornets, gets stuck and crashes the app. The visitors feature is really distracting. I may decide to turn that setting off - I wonder if that is part of why the whole program is glitchy for everyone, though, since there's a lot more going on now. That said, I love the new destinations, the destination-specific items, and all the self-care features, decorating the house/nest, dressing the finch...",4.0
Mincraft. Mistries,Functional,"I hate writing reviews, but I love this app. I actually have an incentive to get my goals done to decorate my bird/house. My only complaint is that I can't choose the time that my goals reset to my knowledge. They all reset at 12, which may seem really late to others, but I'm a bit of a night owl (pun not intended) and stay up past 12, and would like to have the ability to choose when my goals reset, if there is a way and I'm just stupid please let me know, otherwise this is an amazing app :))",4.0
Jade Dennison,Functional,This app is absolutely lovely and helps me so much to practice self care and keep track of my goals. I am happily subscribed to the premium paid service as well. My only real complaint is that the app suffers from a real lack of optimization. I've used the app across multiple phones and have had lots of problems with lag and frame rate drops on both. It's especially evident when petting my finch but also shows up when completing goals. Would love to see it get fixed in the future,4.0
Alice Raia,Functional,"I use this app every day to feel more in control of my days as well as getting affirmation for things usually overlooked or considered easy. I also really enjoy the customization and ability to watch my finch grow with my accomplishments. However I wish there was more depth to the social aspect of it other than just sending vibes. Let me send messages! And the sign-up link for my friends has not worked properly, and not being able to look up friends using numbers or email is frustrating.",4.0
Sara Cate,Functional,"4 stars because there's no way for you to unlock the monthly event pet if you have a free account. Why not have it where you need to do EVERY DAY or something? More difficult, but not impossible. This is one of my favorite apps on my phone. It's really helpful when it comes to keeping on top of mental health and goals that I want to get done. Sending my little bird on adventures is good motivation.",4.0
ToxicOrangeCoffee,Functional,"this is adorable. and so far, it is helping me stay on track with stuff. I've only been using it a few days. Now that it has been awhile I figured I would update this. It is still a great app! The missing star is solely because the excersise videos are unreliable. Sometime they don't load past the first one and the names of these types of excersises vary so much you can't even look up what the next one is. I hope this can get fixed because they are good when they work!",4.0
Mike Tang,Functional,"Overall, this app is awesome - so helpful for building positive, self-care habits. BUT if you're actually struggling with anxiety, depression, etc. go into this ready for the horrible UX. The experience trying to navigate the app (especially adding friends or managing payments) is nauseating how horrible it is. Might be weird that I would still highly recommend this app, but I absolutely do. It's extremely helpful and makes self-care fun. Really good concept, incredibly helpful, really bad ux.",4.0
Amara,Functional,"I love this app and I've been using it for a while, but one of my tags for a person keeps saying it's an object, and will switch itself back to object after I change it. This tag is connected to that person in tree town, so when i click on their bird, it brings up the tag screen, saying no reflections or anything even thought there should be info. It won't let me interact with them, and it brings up the wrong screen. It also won't let me download a save file, so I can't think how I can fix it.",4.0
Abbie King,Functional,"Overall I think it is a great app and very wall amde. However the plus version is very expensive and I I can't afford it yet the adds for it get slightly anoying. I think I need a little more pressure to complete all the goals though instead of just afew, and it would be fantastic if you could adjust a goal to make it really worth doing. Like a hard one like working out. Overall though I use this all every day and I love it.",4.0
Laelani C,Functional,"I love this app. It's super cute and there's no ads. You can buy plus but you don't need it to enjoy the app. The only thing that could be improved on more ways to interact with your finch. Like feeding to it, playing with it, etc. But other than that it's perfect and I definetly reccomend.",4.0
Krystal Pollard,Functional,"Update: I love this app. I've had it for over a year. They have made consistent improvements to the app. Love the micro pets, treetown neighbors, and the rooms. I've even convinced a few friends to try it. They enjoy it as well. There could be a few more improvements, particularly in the movements area. Like adding some Brief workouts might be nice. But I honestly think that the team will continue to work on improving the overall use of the app. And they will continue to have my support.",4.0
Gracen Buchanan,Functional,"I absolutely loved this app! However, the price and one functionality brought it down for me. I really really enjoyed watching my birb grow up but once it's fully grown nothing happens anymore. I think it would be cool if my birb ""left the nest"" so to speak. Went off too college and I got a new baby bird to take care of. Not sure what this would do to already collected items and stuff, maybe you could choose what to keep and get rid of at that time.",4.0
Tee Dee,Functional,"Pro: Easy to use and add goals to... and special journeys help with stress and exercise. Con: it took me too long to figure out my day. I work odd hours, so I often would go to close my day at 2 or 3 a.m., only to find a new day had started so my achievements were missed. I like the program but it's expensive. I might try the larger program once I return to full time work.",4.0
Brittany Meier,Functional,"I love this app and think it's a fun way to monitor my health and set goals. I enjoy having a Finch pet to take care of and feel motivated to engage to help them grow, travel, and achieve their goals. After the 6/5/23 update rolled out, my app freezes on startup and I'm unable to use it. I hope this is just a temporary bug. Overall, this is a great app!",4.0
Christopher Burke,Functional,"I really like the idea of the app. It is thoughtful, interesting and can get you thinking. Great to go through with someone else. The pay wall is a bit much for me. While yearly rates are offered they are still too much and sometimes you get a goal to do like a 5 minute breathing exercise but it only let's you do the exercise for 1 or 3 minutes. The 5 minute option is locked unless you pay. I just do the exercise with another app and come back to make it completed. Still good, overall.",4.0
Meli M,Functional,"Cute theme and reminders, plenty to do without paying so it's not just a money grab. Lost a star because it doesn't automatically back up its data at all. You have to manually do it, so if you forget or don't do it often enough, you lose progress. Lost a fair bit because the app started crashing on open, and no fix worked until uninstalling to reinstall it. Given the purpose of the app, it's dependent on motivation that might not be there, and is incredibly demotivating to lose progress.",4.0
Timecho,Functional,"Overall pretty good app. Would recommend it. It customizable, cute, interactive and easy to navigate. I do also like the inclusion of when your waking hours are, since I'm very much a night owl so I'm not up in the morning. The one gripe I have with it, is that it's stretches and exercises that they show you are very limited, and may also be restricted to certain times of the day, meaning if you only stretch/excercise in the morning, you may only see a limited amount of them.",4.0
Bridget Van't Hof,Functional,I absolutely love this app it has helped not just my mental health but remembering to do things and actually getting them done! There are a few things that could be improved but that is with any app really. One thing I am having issues with is time zones. I travel for extend periods and the time zones never change and I have tried everything possible to get it to change. Which is a bit of a challenge to get the full potential.,4.0
Ta Ge,Functional,"Decent app. Got bored with it shy of two months, which may have been the first update I had. Prior to that, there was more you could do without premium. Like that it has ability for frequent check in. Most apps give you the option to do it once. Moods change throughout the day and could be because of an experience. Finch gives you the ability to write that down in the moment's reflection. It has glitches in typing. If you forget to check in, you can't complete goals until after.",4.0
Beth Sanderson,Functional,"I love this app. Journaling has helped with a lot of my ADHD, anxiety and depression, and it has some really useful exercises. Also love getting to dress up my finch and learning about her adventures. Couple of small things I would like to suggest. First, it would be cool if you could make custom sound mixes to listen to, even if it was just a plus feature. Second, I really wish there was a way to pull up a list of all of your set goals, and more easily manage them. Overall, strongly recommend.",4.0
Kayla Diaz,Functional,"This is such a great app and helps me get into a habit of journaling from time to time. A good idea would probably to add little mini games to relieve stress and have fun especially in a space that gives you anxiety. One thing I have to admit is that the soundscapes... Are kinda scary. Soft rain sounds way too hard to be considered soft. The animal sounds sort of sound weird, but it's really just my opinion. I tend to skip those. But overall I definitely recommend this app! :)",4.0
Elizabeth F,Functional,"Highly recommend for self care, motivation, and journaling/reflections. I only have a few minor gripes. There are times when the ui isn't as intuitive as it could be â€“ I've been using it for over a month and still often forget how to get to certain features like focuses, previous days' goals, closet, etc and have to click around to find them again. Also the game art was recently updated and I prefer the older art. It was a minor change but I'm just not a fan of the way the legs look now.",4.0
Denise Russell,Functional,"I love this app! I did have some issues where I couldn't get into it for about a week, and am kinda disappointed I never got a response to the email I sent (that I was asked to send?) But luckily reinstalling the app fixed it. And luckily I have my game synced (not sure if that's available to everyone, I know it was a beta test when I signed up for it). Would definitely recommend either syncing or sending a backup often so you don't lose everything if your phone breaks or something",4.0
Maddie U,Functional,"It's a fun app and it's a great way to write out your thoughts, keep track of your moods and mental health. I also love the breathing exercises, yoga and stretching exercises, and other options to help for when you're having a bad time. One other good thing is that it offers they/them pronouns. I will say that I wish it offered or updated to have new/more options, and when displaying stats, I'd prefer them as a pie chart instead of bar graphs cuz I find those easier to read.",4.0
Arista,Functional,"It's a really great app, after trying the free trail you really see how much you're missing though, and at $39.99 a year its a bit expensive. (They do give you a monthly $5.99 option, although in the long run you'd spend much more, ($72 per year) that way. But yeah If I had the money I would certainly buy the full version for a year up front. This is the first time an app has actually helped me a bit with with my anxiety and depression, it also helps me to stay mindful. I would def recommend!!!",4.0
Hannah Suchor,Functional,"I've tried tons of self-care and to-do apps and I always give up on them within a week. I expected the same to be true of Finch, but here I am two months later using it every day! It's super cute, just rewarding enough, and the free version has plenty of features so I feel like free or pro is actually a choice. I think the algorithms that categorize your goals and sort keywords into ""lifted you up"" and ""held you back"" (or w/e it is) could use some refinement, but it's a good app!",4.0
Ariel Henson,Functional,"This app has been a huge help to me, but I'm about to lose a ninety-plus day streak because the app was down the majority of the day. When I was finally able to update the app, I'm not allowed passed the Syncing screen. Without the ""skip sync"" option, I only have an Unknown Error screen. I don't want to lose my finch or all the progress I've made. I share the things I do on the app with my actual therapist, who requests to see my progress at each appointment (twice a week). Please, help.",4.0
A P,Functional,"It's good, but lacking. Some of the user interface is confusing and not intuitive. As far as I can tell, I'm unable to save pictures into my reflections. And reflections are saved in an atrocious format that doesn't include the question that prompted them, just a floating blurb you typed with no context. It's hard to reflect on your reflections when you're sitting there wondering what made you say it.",4.0
AH,Functional,"Mostly loving this app so far. But I'm finding the actual pet part a bit lacking. My bird is adorable, but every morning I just basically do one task, like choose goals, and he's instantly energized and can go adventuring. I wish that was a bit more difficult to earn, to motivate me to use the tools in the app more often. I know I can make him come back early, but that doesn't matter really so it's not motivating. Also I'd love more ""virtual pet aspects""...""giving food, toys, more to buy!",4.0
C W,Functional,Finch is really engaging and easy to use. There is not a lot to do in the app which is perfect for me since I tend to get burned out by apps like this easily with more options. Would like an option to create my own goals (at least one) outside of premium. Also the algorithm for identifying words relating to negative and positive emotions could be better or at least editable so results aren't skewed.,4.0
Cadence H,Functional,"Overall great app! Everything functions well and it's easy. However, I think the devs should add a way to make reoccurring goals. Ex: every sunday you need to study, so you make your goal ""study"" and set it to pop up every Sunday for how ever long. I also think they should have extra things in the app like a grocery list, or a list of long term goals. Ex: you really want a computer, tablet, and switch so they're all in your list. So you come back and check off the things as you get them.",4.0
Cheyo Notary,Functional,"This is a lovely app, and I really do adore the way it encourages self care and motivation. The only issue I have is that when ""morning stretches"" come up (which is a very cool feature as it provides video examples and selectable times) and you select ""sitting stretches"", it provides literally anything but sitting. I'm disabled. I'm not doing downward dog when I selected ""sitting"" stretches. It just seems like the stretch selection option doesnt work",4.0
Morgan Taylor,Functional,"This app is amazing! It helps me take better care of myself and manage my neurodivergence without getting overwhelmed as often. I've been on Finch for over a year. I got Finch Plus, and it's 100% worth it! My only complaint is that there are occasionally times when I notice the app being exclusive of those with physical disabilities. It doesn't offer alternative exercises for things we can't do, and this month I keep being sent visitors with flashing glasses that could trigger my epilepsy.",4.0
R H,Functional,"This app has helped me remember and motivate myself to do a number of things that I would otherwise forget, which has been my main stumbling block. 4 stars due a few issues. When you do custom answers with your Finch, their discoveries do not get added to their profile, which is extremely frustrating. The update pop-up: when I am redirected, I don't get the option to update on the app page. I need a priority flag for tasks that HAVE to get done, so they automatically roll over if not completed.",4.0
N. de la Parte,Functional,"I like Finch. I use it primarily as a cute little list maker with reminders. It's helpful to me to make a list and check off even tiny tasks. However the last update is stopping me from entering ""goals of the day"" after about 3 entries, forcing me to go back and forth to make my complete list. This is a major step backwards in functionality. Please let users do what they find most useful instead of discouraging certain aspects of the app.",4.0
Alex Winter,Functional,"A great little personal development app, though it is best used with friends or a spouse/significant other. The frame rate is weirdly slow in some places, and performance and responsiveness overall could be better, but it does what it advertises, and does it effectively. It's fun to use, the devs are frequently adding new cosmetics and functionality to keep it fresh, and it has genuinely helped me have a more positive outlook.",4.0
The Magic Pinecone,Functional,"Very good self-care app. Love the aesthetics of it. Having a cute virtual pet is a good motivation for me to want to do the goals. But I really like how it's not designed to pressure you, like a few other apps I've tried. It's very understanding and forgiving of depressed/negative moods, even giving you extra energy for goals. It would be a five star app for me, if they had more things you can do for free. There's just so little goals in the free version in my opinion.",4.0
Allie Yi,Functional,"It was a pleasant app while I used it. The inspirational quotes are good food for thought, and the prompts are useful. Unfortunately, some prompts are locked behind the premium version, which is understandable. Regardless, you can just do a free form reflection if you care that much a certain prompt. Overall, it is good and helpful. I enjoyed it. The developers seem kind hearted and willing to take suggestions, so I do recommend. :)",4.0
Hunter,Functional,I've had this app for a year and I've loved it so far. The only problem is that recently whenever I complete a reflection or set my goals for the next day they don't disappear once completed anymore. So I keep getting the same prompts and the prompt to set goals for the day never goes away. I'm not sure if there was an update that messed up the app for me but it's pretty frustrating,4.0
Tucker Reeves,Functional,"First of all the app is really great. However, I do have a few issues with the app. 1st, since you can't report mood more than once per hour, if you have a drastic mood change you can't document it, and 2nd the monthly challenge feature being limited ends up adding extra stress to those of us with mental issues. I am neurodivergent, and missing out is really painful for me so to have an event that I can entirely miss just makes it feel like a chore not a check in.",4.0
Mackenan Miller,Functional,"This is quite possibly the best self help app I've seen, and I've seen quite a few. It's simplistic and doesn't bombard you with choices. That said there are a few things I'd like to change, very minor though. For stretches, it's probably best if you do the stretches on both sides, for example the right leg rock, do it in the left leg too. And I would like if every day they gave you 3-4 goals to choose from. Some things I like about it is how it lets you choose from prompts to journal from.",4.0
SilesSoros,Functional,"This is a pretty good app, I appreciate how much content there is in the free version. I do have a few complaints, in the stretches or sometimes the breathing exercises, there would be lag, making the timings off. I also think that the locked exercises/reflections/etc should work like you very very slowly unlock them maybe once you meet a certain criteria or maybe it would be time based. I just think that the locked ones shouldn't be strictly plus membership, but I get the reasons.",4.0
Amber Giller,Functional,I love the app for the most part. While trying the plus version I noticed that the sound scapes do not go for more than 30 minutes even though there is a time setting for 1 hr and 8 hrs. This was really frusterating because I wanted to listen for 8 hrs one day and I couldn't and it made my stress and anxiety worse. I can't see paying for the plus service when the the app doesn't work right.,4.0
Greta,Functional,"It's an adorable little app! I'll start by listing the things I love. I love the reflections and how after you write them you can see emotions you showed and all that, I also like that you can change the emotion you were expressing in case they got it wrong! I also understand that the developers need to make money but the 30 something dollars yearly is a LOT... I won't be paying for it but the free version still has a lot to offer. I love the stretches and breathing exercises. It's great!",4.0
Lindsey,Functional,this app is great! however there are a few things that can be confusing and cause the user to think they have to pay to use the app at all. i have never paid for this app but ive been throughly enjoying it for at least 8 months now. sometimes the pop-ups advertising the premium service can be a little invasive and im not completely sure how to feel about the battle pass-esque system (for lack of better phrasing). its not that bad since the items can be available in the store besides the pets,4.0
Amanda Finn,Functional,Very interesting to use. I've tried alot of apps. I definitely recommend trying it out. The change what I'd recommend that any energy that is accumilated without starting the journey should be counted. There are many times that I've aquired energy before starting an adventure. I think energy should be able to be accumulated. And maybe different levels of adventures using different amounts of energy.,4.0
Lauren Levy,Functional,"UPDATE: It keeps telling me I need to update the app, but when I click on the button it brings me to the play store and the only option is to ""install on all devices."" I can't update it! I'm on android. Love this app! I have the free version and it's great, and NO ADS! The premium version is affordable also when they offer the discount. I literally recommend this app to most of my clients (I'm a therapist). And it's helping me and my partner connect.",4.0
Jason Burnett,Functional,"Free is best. I had a subscription in the hopes it would let me schedule recurring goals and tasks, it didn't. It's really all the app is missing right now. The subscription does not add enough to make the extra cost worthwhile. Also it was very difficult to unsubscribe, which feels kinda manipulative, to unsubscribe you cannot do it in the app, you have to go to the play store.",4.0
Melissa Negron,Functional,Love this app! Only thing I wish they would change are the goals/reminders. Even if you set your goals for a specific time all the goals show up in your feed at the same time every morning. It could feel and look a bit overwhelming. It would be better if the goals would pop up at the specific time you indicated to be reminded instead.,4.0
L Smith,Functional,"Adorable app and surprisingly helpful in very practical ways. Premium is absolutely worth getting, but if you truly can't afford it the free version is still cute and helpful. If you dislike an activity you can mute and never see it again. Plus you can input custom goals as well. Highly recommend. EDIT: Only problem, items keep disappearing from my inventory. First time they were good about replacing quickly but i don't want to keep reporting things, i'd like to just NOT have my items gone.",4.0
Lukas Pettiford,Functional,"Love it so far, especially the breathing exercises and journaling, it has noticeably helped me calm down. The only gripe I have is it seems like every other day it asks me to buy premium. I live paycheck to paycheck so I absolutely cannot afford any subscriptions and although I understand that it's a free app and they need to keep it running (I sincerely respect that), it gets a little annoying having to say no pretty much every time and wish it was less repetitive. Other than that it's amazing!",4.0
Sierra Mason,Functional,"This is by far the best and most helpful self help tool I've ever used. When you take care of yourself you're also taking care of this virtual pet, which is a great motivator. The insights are really cool too and like 95% of the app is free. My only issue is that when using keywords (family, hope, fade) the app assigns positive, negative, or neutral to them. I wish there was a way to edit these. For example, watching the movie Scream is a positive thing, but the app assigned it as negative.",4.0
Ariana Furrer,Functional,"This is the best app on my phone & I love almost everything about it. Sadly it seems that w/ each update, certain things get clunkier, such as goals. I'm getting tired of spending so long each day having to constantly reorganize the goal list. It used to be that w/e order you put the list would stay that way until you added new things which would just show up 1st. So 1 time goals would show up before journey ones and stay in the order you dragged and dropped them. Now they change all the time.",4.0
Luke C,Functional,"Really wonderful app! Unlike most apps, Finch doesn't punish you if you need a few days off from checking in. Easy to manage with a lot of really useful insights into your own patterns of behavior. My only issue is that sadly the last update broke the UI, making the app mostly unusable. The team has been kind enough to add a report button for individuals to save their data, but the team is very small and data corruption takes an undetermined amount of time to fix.",4.0
Kelley Seifert,Functional,"Cute app! I like the idea of taking care of my little guy by taking care of myself. And how it tracks the little ways I am making progress with words. Though after playing with this for a while now, I wish it would set a limit to how many things you can do. I thought I could complete the list but more keep popping up and it makes my list oriented self a little crazy!",4.0
Jimmothy Boyles,Functional,"Very soothing app for me at least. Having this little bird remind me to do stuff has actually helped me somewhat put my life together. My suggestion to the developers would be to add more options to the breathing exercises in the app that are not behind a paywall, because the default breathing exercise may not work for everyone, even though it did work for me. I think it's only fair to give people the choice of what breathing exercises to do without having to pay. Other than that, very good.",4.0
Jack,Functional,"Been using 3 months now and just finished the free trial of Plus. The free app is great for motivation and reflection. It caters to people who are depressed, anxious, or have executive dysfunction. I have the latter but mainly use it to start and end my day positively. It's bad for productivity tracking because it has distracting little rewards for tasks like breathing and writing. Plus isn't worth it currently, and the whole app needs better QoL/interface. I'll consider paying if it improves.",4.0
Lindsey O'Neal,Functional,"I've been struggling with a lot of anxiety and this app has helped me beyond measure. I haven't run into any paywalls yet but we'll see how long I use it. It's been about a week, but I'm obsessed. It's a great way to check in, balance mood, set physical and mental goals, and stay grounded. Update: can someone help me the screen has now gone completely gray and it will not load any of the interactions with my pet.",4.0
Sharon Standridge,Functional,"The free version is helpful. Being able to group with friends through the app and send encouragement is nice. The pet really does develop with your choices in their journey, and the art is cute. My ADLs are easier to do, and I've learned new grounding techniques. You have full access to the SOS action list, and there's no ads. The only complaint is that the relationship with my finch deteriorates if I miss a few days. That's hard on me since it feels like losing a friend because of rough days.",4.0
Eudaemonic Misfit (Nico),Functional,I absolutely love this app! All the features are wonderful! Thr onoy thing I would change would be the format of when you edit goals. I noticed that when you try to delete some goals and press the okay button. It doesnt actually get rid of those deleted goals after you log out and log back in. It doesnt save the changes. Thats really about it that I have seen that I keep getting irritated by but thats really it,4.0
Serenity Tomala,Functional,"Has done a lot over the last couple of months to help my mindset, and get me through some of the harder days. The goals and the check ins help concentrate on what's really going on and find a positive moments when feels like everything is awful. However, I only gave it 4 stars because once your bird gets to adulthood, it gets very hard to unlock things and starts to feel a bit repetitive. It makes it easy to forget to do things, and makes goals feel less impactful. I'll continue to use, but less",4.0
Hazel Foreman,Functional,"I absolutely love this app, it works really well for developing healthy behaviors and building habits of all kinds. The finch is adorable. I just wish there were more/better clothing options for the finch. I think my favorite part is dressing them up with me but many of the clothes are kind of unappealing visually. There are lots of fancy looking options, but I would like more casual options that aren't just plain text on a tshirt, for example.",4.0
Emily Johnson,Functional,So far the app has been great. I had the week trial then payed for the year! It has been a really nice brief way to check on periodically throughout the day. The only problem I have is that the cute little finch accessories are still pricy even after paying. I was hoping that some items would be free or vastly reduced. I have only been able to afford one item for Sven(my finch) after a week of checking in and what not.,4.0
ASHR,Functional,"Love this app, it feels incredibly helpful and rewarding even if you're just using the free version. But I have noticed that whenever I add a goal to a focus that is then scheduled for a specific date, that goal doesn't show up on my goal list for that day and goes completely unnoticed and unmentioned unless I check back on the actual focus page. This bug is frustrating and makes the app unhelpful for one-time goals",4.0
Sarah A,Functional,"I enjoy all the opportunities to journal and I am motivated by the cute little finch. I like that it has light excercises and breathing tools. A cute feature is being able to dress up the finch. So, normally I like sound mixes to meditate to or otherwise relax but I think that maybe half of them are rather creepy. The owls and wolves....um, no. I think that they have a good platform but the sounds need tweaking. Less grainy sounding and more soothing sounds needed. Otherwise a great app!",4.0
N J,Functional,seems like it will be beneficial. biggest issue i have is that i need content to be offline as I'm frequently out of service range. i understand it would be unfeasible to install all featured content onto people's phones. but maybe offer the ability to locally save favorite exercises so that they're still available even when offline. it would be really appreciated to be able to stop and do a quick stretch or soundscape when i needed to regardless of my connectivity.,4.0
Lea Arroyo,Functional,"It's a pretty good app. I don't like how so many things are locked behind a paywall, though. This app helps me set goals for the day and suggests things to do such as spending time with family or taking time for myself. It has breathing exercises (though many you have to pay for) and quizzes relating to mental health. One suggestion is that I wish it had a to-do list feature, which would have you make a to-do list and remind you of your things to do. Overall it's pretty good.",4.0
Cat Rice,Functional,"This app is great for self care and those of us motivated by caring for a cure bird, but the notifications are awful. It just makes up new notifications pretty much any time the bird wants to say something, so even if you have everything but one or two notifications turned on it will randomly notify you for no real reason unless all your notifications are turned off. Also, it adds so many different kinds of notifications in the app settings that it's hard to find what you might want on at all.",4.0
J H,Functional,I really like this app and it's gotten even better since I started using it. The newest added feature that condenses time assigned tasks was a great thing for someone like me that can have 100 goals in any given day. One thing I wish they would add as an option is to choose if we want the progress reports throughout the week or if we want them combined and only delivered once or twice a week. I would love being able to have the option for one or two reports with all the info.,4.0
Kiana Komatsu,Functional,"App is helpful for giving the little push need and accpuntability without nagging you. There are somthings I think changing that would be good. The subscription section through the app is not interactable, I would like to know if there are more $ plans avalible through the app and when my next payment is needed. The play store allows it a bit, but even on the website how much we pay is not clear enough. The text size when editing ""reflections"" is a bit small and hard to interact with as well.",4.0
R. S.,Functional,"Finch has been an incredible tool. The lack of shame or punishment over missed tasks is really key, but there's also nice arrangement of prompts and exercises with customizable goals. The task timer is one of my favorite tools, especially with the journal option to reflect if you're stuck on that task. I do think more customizable prompts would be nice, and maybe more guidance/encouragement for executive function? Dye purchases also can't be made at Da Finci's since the update. :(",4.0
Mossy,Functional,"Overall I've been using this for three weeks now, I got a real kick out of the first few weeks. Genuinely some very helpful ideas on here- breathing exercises, good incentive to complete goals without feeling overbearing, and a good atmosphere. However, there is a LOT locked behind a paywall, and the app felt incomplete until I got a free month subscription. The app is also extremely laggy and glitchy and you can't access soundscapes or stretches offline. Still worth a spin imo!",4.0
Zealtiel Zuniga,Functional,"I've been using the app for the past three days and I LOVE it! I want to make myself better to protect my little boy, BUT I feel like one thing is missing. If possible, i would like a way to directly interact with my bird. That could be in minigames like just dodging obstacles or even just being able to pet him and pose my buddy for screenshots. Those additions would be awesome!",4.0
Sunny Neon Raye,Functional,"the activities are helpful for mindfulness, without being too distracting or demanding. you aren't pestered or penalized for missing a check in. you can even add people to your ""neighborhood"" without them adding the app, and Finch will give suggestions to reach out to those freinds. great for anxiety and adhd. the logic of how the app parses out your reflections is pretty solid; it's impressive! UI design is a little busy, and if my buddy is visiting the forest I can't seem to go back home.",4.0
Liliana Saeteurn,Functional,"This app is good but most of the features cost a subscription which as a high school student causes me more stress. Two thing that I don't personally like is the fact that there is only one exercise for day and another for night. the other thing that I don't like is that it involves a lot of typing and in your journal the ai says what mood it gives off or something, basically I'd like it for the user to edit what it meant for the user. Overall good app.",4.0
Kitty Rosalina,Functional,"I really love this app. It has made such a big difference in my life. I wish there was more personalization options with everything. The biggest thing I want is the ability to add our own permanent reflections, first aid, everything. There are a lot of options but everyone is different and I don't want to add things as goals when it's a writing prompt I want to do every now and then as a reflection. A special goal that you can repeat for things you need to do mutiple times a day.",4.0
Elizabeth Freeze,Functional,I'm really enjoying this app. The motivational quotes each day seem to be just what I need to hear. I love that there's a first aid kit for if you're in a mental emergency. The breathing exercises are great. I wish there was a way to earn more of the rainbow stones since all the clothes and such are so expensive. Also the tree friend feature would be nice if you had a better way to search for friends. Also when someone randomly visits I wish there was a prompt to friend them. Overall fun app!,4.0
Doctor Good WhOmens Leech,Functional,"It is great so far from what I have tried, but on a LG Stylo 6, it lags a great bit. When your pet goes off on an adventure, it just lags out my phone and I have to restart it completely. I like it so far, just wish there wasn't so much lag. I don't know if it could just be my phone, or something with the app, but I love the app either way.",4.0
Ivy Mae,Functional,"I really enjoy this app! it's cute and encouraging to keep you trying to stay on your habits or journeys. It's fun to grow together with your penguin buddy, and the customization for outfits and your home is really nice to have, who doesn't like to customize? I only wish that the premium version had more to offer, maybe more quizzes or other features. I'll keep playing with this and update if I think of other things to add to this review.",4.0
Heather Harmon,Functional,"Super cute and only been a couple days but seeing some improvement already! Update after 2months; I was really enjoying this app and being able to see the improvement through my pet and even myself! Then I went on vacation that didn't allow me to access internet. And in just those 10 days it was like I had been ""punished"" for being away that long, which I can understand to an extent but in my opinion, there should be a pause/vacation mode added. The back peddling makes me not want to use Finch.",4.0
Kristina Mullen,Functional,"I rate this app a 4 because it is a really good app. Surrounds you with really good coping tools. Helps with sleep, you can write about your day, and set goals, and take a bunch of diff test that vary from ptsd, anxiety, depression and more. Also gives you a first aid option that guides you through a panic attack. The only thing I would say needs improving is that the daily questions get a bit repetitive and was the reason I stopped using for a bit. Would appreciate it if they add more variety!",4.0
Collyn Curry,Functional,"Overall I love this app! I have the paid subscription and it's definitely worth it for the extra features. However, I find it really frustrating that the amount of gems you get varies so much between exercises, activities, from your Finch at the end of their trip, and even in your daily reward box. I can't figure out why answering my Sammy's questions gives x amount of stones one day but then y amount the next day. It adds a lot of unnecessary stress as I try to figure out the ""right"" answer.",4.0
Sarah Mitchell,Functional,"Awesome, adorable app! I like that you can set reminders to do things, and that the app checks in on you. It can also remind you to get ready for bed at a given time. The only things I would like to see is a way to set your own goals(type them in), or an expanded list of goals you can choose from. (I am a subscribed user. â™¡) P.s. I was wondering if there might be some suggested affirmations in the future? While I like having to come up with my own sometimes, I can't always remember to set one.",4.0
Kate,Functional,Really great app. But there are SO many features and icons that it becomes difficult to navigate. Every once and awhile I find the area to sell the clothes and house items but can never remember where that is when I need it. Please fix nevigation or create a quick tour video with explanantion. I REALLY wish there were more ways other than to invite people to join... Not everyone wants more apps on their phone.,4.0
Marie Bast,Functional,"Love this app! The finch is adorable and it gives me just a few reminders, exactly what I need without spamming me. One thing I would love is to be able to complete goals the next day easily if I didn't finish them the day before, as well as schedule daily, weekly, or monthly goals/reminders. Also not sure how to check past journal entries, which would be interesting, and I would love for the finch to prompt me to do that.",4.0
Robert Barlow,Functional,"Firstly, this app is amazing, I was a bit skeptical at first like others, but the care taking nature of the app draws you in. It's almost perfect, besides the transaction system. I really wish I could purchase prompts or mailbox subscriptions or other features with Rainbow stones. Anything besides the basics are locked behind a subscription service. You'd also think the transaction stuff would be on cosmetics, not mental health prompts.",4.0
Dakota H,Functional,"Love it so far. Few minor things It should be easier to write goals for the next day/week. I'm not sure if that's a paid feature but it would be a nice option. I'd like to see all my entrys I've made and the associated prompts too. Also you cant paste in the app. I wrote a dream of mine in my notes app, and when the prompt showed up in the morning I wasnt able to add it without fully rewriting Otherwise I think this is a really great app and its really been a positive addition to my life",4.0
Rebekah Diane,Functional,I absolutely love this app. There are a few problems I have with the app though. There are times where I make a positive reflection and the app for some reason sees it as a negative reflection so I'd really prefer a way to put what type of reflection I'm making and picking my own emoji to go with the reflection because I really don't like that my positive reflections are being turned into negative reflections that's very frustrating. Also there could be more choices for dressing up Finch.,4.0
Lynda Estacio,Functional,"Overall, I love this app so far. I've been using it almost 2 weeks, and I'm actively using it, which is more than I've interacted with other goal/ habit/ self- care apps in the past. One enhancement I'd like to see is the ability to easily create my own recurring goals, without having to hack it in through the focus goals.",4.0
Rassta,Functional,"I really like this app but there are two important things that would improve my experience as a user. One: please make the journals(reflections, inner voice etc.) more accessible. If you can make a calendar and by clicking on it I can have access to what I wrote that day, it would be great. Two: these automatic hashtags are mostly wrong and a bit annoying. Other than these I really enjoy using it. Thanks",4.0
Peter Zuchowski,Functional,"The user interface is unintuitive when adding or editing your own goals. EDIT: But the app really is great and motivating. I intend on buying the subscription to access the full possibilities with it, even though I could likely just make my own goals and achieve the same effect. It is really a success at gameifying self-improvement, and I want to see Finch succeed as a business model.",4.0
Helia Cinders,Functional,"I love the app! It's definitely helped me in taking better care of myself with reminders to check in and my need to see my finch grow. I do wish I could set up custom frequency, like to be able to say ""4 times a week"" and it accurately do that. I also wish the friend connection/Tree Town was a 2 way connection and there was more space for friends. This is a wonderful app and I'd like to help encourage all my friends on the app not just 8 friends that I have visible.",4.0
Diana,Functional,"I think i update my review every so often. I've been using this app for months, and besides a paper planner this has been a great thing for me! I love all the new clothing updates, keep them coming! Just wanted to note on a glitch I've been seeing. When I skip a task to the next day, they don't appear. When I go into goals, i see them. But when I save, they're not there again so i basically have to retype them which isn't a big deal but this never happened before.",4.0
J B,Functional,"The app has great potential. It's really good to help set goals, and let you track them them for bonuses to help your finch grow. I just wish you could customize the finch faster. It does have quizzes to help see where you fall on different topics (sleep, anxiety, etc). I can't wait to see what they add for additional self care tools. Maybe new suggested goal to try a new hobby or possible activity.",4.0
Becky M,Functional,"Nice app, but needs more options for clothes...totally random and leans toward masculine clothing, even if you choose female. Silly little thing, but the lack of good options does lower my daughter's interest to use it consistently. Same for the adventures...more info or visuals related to what finch experienced would be a huge boost.. But the concept is nice and she likes it...just losing the appeal a bit. I also back the review that mentions getting to use the accessories.",4.0
Meagan Laun,Functional,"This is the first app like this but I've actually been able to stick to everyday since I was introduced to it! The only thing that disappointed me is that I already explored 100% of the finch forest and since there's nothing after it I don't feel as motivated to keep going since I ""100% the game"". I wish it would go to a different area to explore whenever you completed one.",4.0
Rylee Anonymous,Functional,"finch is very accessable to use and very user friendly. i figured it all our very easily. it helps me manage my tasks. i wish i could find a log of all the reflections I've made, but it's not too much of an issue. its a nice app and it gives you something to care for, which is helpful. overall, i really like it, i just wish i could see the things i wrote earlier.",4.0
Ezzie Moonie,Functional,"really enjoy this app a lot, helps me /want/ to do things that need to get done. i have adhd, anxiety and depression so i definitely struggle with finding motive for responsibilities, but this gives me a very easy and stress free way of getting them done and theres no consequence for anything i might not have not been able to accomplish! it's amazing to see the progress being made and i can't wait to see even more improvements in the future. definitely something i'll recommend to friends!!!",4.0
hayley,Functional,"It's overall a really cute app; the questions are intriguing and the animations are really cute. Personally, it was hard for me to stay committed to using the app because everything got a little repetetive and I lost interest, but I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a mood tracker.",4.0
Selena Hatfield,Functional,"Cute. Wish I could do more with my pet, like play mini games. Edit: After more time, I really enjoy the app. I use the writing prompts a lot, and love the cricket soundscape. I often put the crickets on 8 hours to sleep. I still wish there were more ways to interact with your Finch, like feeding them snacks, or playing games. Maybe giving them a bath. But even without those things it's a lovely app.",4.0
Amanda,Functional,"I loved this app at first, and the longer I've used it, the more useful it has become. I would love some more color options and way to reorder the journeys, but these are minor issues. I have put daily/weekly tasks in, which has offload a bunch of mental work. What used to take me forever can now be done in like 10-20 mins and is simple. The learning curve was high at first - some features aren't intuitive, but as I've learned more about the features, it has just become more invaluable.",5.0
Theresa Uhlmann,Functional,I have struggled to find an app that helps schedule time for self care that was fun and I could stick with. This app really helps me stay on track. It really helps me to keep goals that I have throughout the week and is super customizable to my daily schedule changes. It's fun. Its interactive. And the reports that track mood changes anxiety patterns and triggers is awesome. And most of it is free! There is a paid upgrade but I don't have the budget for it right now.,5.0
Abigail Adams,Functional,"This app is so amazing. Helps with personal goals, without trying to shove it on your face. It has all kind of things, such as timers, calimg sounds, quizzes for ptsd, anxiety, depression, etc. And so much more. It gives you basic goals such as brush your teeth, shower, wash ur face, and you can make your own goals. I have yet to have any ad's. I definitely recommend it!!",5.0
Rachel Ann Pierce,Functional,"I love this app! You can set all of your own tasks or go with prompts they provide. I sometimes use the breathing exercises or focus timers, which can also be linked to to-do list tasks. Your little birb does the meditation with you, which is so cute! Finch keeps me on track with the little habits that tend to fall through the cracks otherwise. I like how specific I can get, setting tasks to repeat, with or without notifications. I've recommended it to multiple friends, who started using it too!",5.0
Penelope Lira,Functional,"The app is amazing. There is a free program, and a plus program. A lot of the times they give you the plus side of stuff as a reward, or a preview. (still completely free), They have exercises that compare to journaling, and even some that can calm down your anxiety. Setting goals and watching my Finch grow up really motivates me to complete everything and get through my day.",5.0
Yari Vickiraytive Pantoja,Functional,I've been looking for a good task-tracking app for a while. Most of the ones I've tried spam ads every time you click something. I almost gave up! Then I found Finch. It respects your time and has so much you can do with it for free. I definitely recommend it if to-do lists are helpful to you. This one is very interactive and motivates you to stay consistent with tasks that you might usually put off til tomorrow. It encourages you to try new things and has wonderful vibes all around. Try it!,5.0
Julian Kittelson-Aldred,Functional,"Finch is incredible. Every time I open it, I can tell if was made by people who really care a lot about their users. Android-specific nitpick: the time picker when you're setting a notification is horrible! Please just use the built-in time picker that Android provides, it's so much faster. The one you're using looks like iOS but it is clunky and only spins one number at a time; setting a notification for 30 minutes after the hour takes waaaay too many swipes.",5.0
darkElfDad Minecraftuser,Functional,"This game is surprisingly helpful and it's honest with it's message to help. I downloaded it for one day and never picked it up again because I got depressed and unmotivated for about a week or 2, then I opened the app up randomly one night when I couldn't sleep. It literally celebrated my return with this cute little bird dancing up and down , with confetti going off in the background.",5.0
Luna,Functional,"Definitely try it! I still can't believe how much of the app is free to use, given this day and age. It's cute, low pressure, and motivating. I'll probably get the subscription soon to access the extra journals (though the vast majority are free!), but mostly to support the developers, because I so greatly appreciate them keeping their app accessible! The journals are also low pressure, but thought provoking and helpful! And the conversations with the pet are interesting and fun.",5.0
David Sissac,Functional,"This app helps me a lot in an interactive way. I've been doing fine with a calendar and to do list but Finch helps to make it more intimate of an experience to practice self care. I really do like this app and hope in the future there will be more functions (more bird colors, more ways to interact with friends, and more unique interactions between you and your bird friend). Keep going you're doing great creators!",5.0
Zaiden Palfreyman,Functional,"The only self care app I've actually stuck with. Premium is 100% worth it, but I do feel some things shouldn't be premium locked. Like adding icons to new tasks. It gets confusing when all my personal made tasks have nonsense random emojis to represent them. And I wish there was a log of previous days you could view/edit. Some days I'm too busy to input things on my phone, but had done all my tasks, and I can't go back and fix that :(",5.0
Chloe,Functional,I've had an absolutely wonderful experience with this app and have nothing bad so say in the slightest. The team who made it is obviously full of amazing and caring people because it is one of the best apps I have come across. They take feedback so well and even offer an option for those who can't afford a subscription to still be able to access paywall blocked content.,5.0
Pink Panther,Functional,"Possibly the greatest app I have ever had. I always struggled to get things done in the past, but now I feel so organized and productive thanks to a digital bird I'm raising. Seriously though. If you wanna do stuff but just struggle to do it, get this app! On top of helping with productivity, it has free stretching exercises, anxiety relief, relaxing soundscapes, goal setting, and of course a customizable birb. I would give six stars if I could!",5.0
Katriana Call,Functional,"I love this app, it's actually helped me stay motivated to be productive and avoid laying in bed all day. Although, I wish there was a way to edit the goals in the day. For example, twice now I've accidentally skipped the wrong goal and had no way to undo it that was clearly shown. Would also be cool to have different animal options for our Finch.",5.0
Stine W,Functional,"It's very cute. I think the gamification of self care is cute and enjoyable. I think it might be a useful boost if you need more motivation to do your self care. Otherwise it's possibly a little too much screen time but at least it's positive rather than scrolling. The first aid tab is a great idea. I'm confused about the adventure setting and don't really know what it is. Overall, I think the journals should be exportable as a diary in txt format.",5.0
Rebecca Gilbertson,Functional,"Such a cute app and kind of addicting to advance my birb along as well as completing my own tasks and goals. Setting longer term goals, takes a few more steps to do and if you forget to have a goal rollover, you'll lose it entirely. I think with the pro/upgraded account, you can see past day history but not in the free account. So far the fact that I'm still using it and on day 5, is impressive to me. With ADHD it's not always easy to maintain my attention to apps and to keep coming back again!",5.0
Alhana McNutt,Functional,"This app helps me with externalising motivation to take care of myself by taking care of a bird. I love the first aid section, which helps with anxiety and depression symptoms. I use the breathing exercises and the soundscapes most often. Although all of the important stuff is free, I paid for a yearly subscription. Sadly, the subscription did not transfer to my new phone! I don't know what to do to fix that",5.0
Edessa Stockard (edessa22),Functional,"Love the app it's super fun and really helpful. I use it as a mental health tracker as well as a to do list. it helps me get things done because it's giving me something else to take care of. I feel more motivated to do things in order to help my Finch grow. It's an adorable app too. Daily affirmations, check lists, progress reports, and a pet who also has pets. I love buying my Finch outfits and having him travel the world. The highlight of each day is when he's back from an adventure! 100/10",5.0
T H,Functional,This app is great. It I had to choose between my therapy app and this one I'd choose to save this one. the app has the ability to lighten my mood and overall outlook on life overall. I think it's great at pulling the best things out of me as I interact with my birb and then reflecting those things back to me. so it's telling me thing I belive in bit have lost sight of. it's brilliant and I love it so much.,5.0
Christy Barrett,Functional,"Such a cute way to motivate me to do more self care things - taking better care of me takes better care of my pet! I love that I can reflect on our interactions and discoveries, and that there's even a rant zone. The quizzes are helpful and I love the affirmations every time I open the app. It's just been a great experience all around. I probably will get the upgrade later but even the free version is great",5.0
Carl White,Functional,"I'm a little embarrassed than to be playing with this micropet, tomagatchi look-a-like. But, honestly, the task scheduling is more sophisticated than Google Tasks, and the playfulness of it reminds me to check it at all. For instance, there are many tasks that one needs to be on repeat, but it does no good to let pile up on your to do list if they don't get done each day. this app can do that.",5.0
Ashley Alberto,Functional,"Honestly, the first time I tried Finch, I did not get the hang of it because it felt like a lot to learn at once. However, after trying other habits and wellness apps, this one takes the cake! It's fun, cute, and actually encourages self care. I feel motivated to complete my daily tasks because of how game-like it is. I do wish Finch had a slower new users tour at the beginning. I feel like, because this app truly does have it all, it can be overwhelming as to where to start, but it's so good.",5.0
Daniele Notarnicola,Functional,"It sounds dramatic, but this app has legit helped me change my life. I was stuck in a really bad rut, and setting goals with this little bird has helped me reconnect with myself, feel more energized and motivated, and, long story short, helped me peel myself off the couch. I had coworkers and friends download it as well, and it has unanimously helped all of us in one way or another â",5.0
Smol Bean,Functional,"You really don't know how much you need it until you have itm. Got it because it looked cute and I wanted to use it to keep on track for doing homework every day, not expecting to use the self care parts. But now whenever things get rough I can do the breathing exercises, have fun doing the adventures with my finch, and it helps me make the most of trials. And as for the productivity uses, it's better than I imagined! It really keeps me motivated to do it and rewards me when I'm done!",5.0
Sia S,Functional,"I would just like to say, I love this app! It helped me stay on goal and getting supportive messages throughout the day is so lovely! I did sign up for premium and am also a guardian as well. Mental and emotional health is so important to me and finally, I'm glad to have an app that supports this so well! Good job to the developers! Edit: would love the option to turn off the pop-up for equipping new items when claiming rewards for the seasonal events. Not a must, but would be lovely it was.",5.0
Priscilla Adejokun,Functional,"It's not therapy, but it's a really good stand-in for just making yourself function. You can start different journeys and keep notes. You can see how you're progressing with the check-ins and such. I really appreciate how guided the stretches and breathing exercises are.... it feels like I'm really cared for, and it's keeping my head afloat when I know that otherwise it wouldn't be. This is a really nice resource.",5.0
Anna Bell,Functional,I love this app so much after my free trial I'm going all in. I have tried over 20 apps to help with daily goals and mental health and I struggle with any because of ADHD. This one has helped me as it tracks little things such as drinking water and showering and even has suggestions for family bonding activities which helps immensely when I get stuck in freeze mode. My only wish would be a widget with daily goals or a way to check them off in notifications without having to open the whole app.,5.0
Jania Rodriguez,Functional,"It's amazing, but only if you really WANT to change your lifestyle. If you're lazy and not willing to, then what's the point? But this motivates me to get done daily tasks and do self care. 10/10 would recommend. the graphics are simple and cute, the instructions are direct, navigation is simple as well!",5.0
Karen Cangero,Functional,"Finch is a delightful app. It is not a substitution for therapy or professional mental health care, but it is a cheerful reminder to take time for you, to set and focus on goals, and to give yourself a break sometimes. The graphics, the settings, the visits, the activities, it's all magnificently well done. I do pay for the full version, but use the free version fine for months. Support is excellent too. I have recommended this to friends. This is a very nice app to remind you to be good to you.",5.0
Catt Walsh,Functional,"This little app is great! The main focus is keeping track of tasks to do each day and getting rewarded for completing those tasks. There are lots of other features from soundscapes, to breathing coaching, to basic mental health screenings. It is easy to use once you get used to the interface and is super cute.",5.0
Cherylyn Lamphear,Functional,"I love this app so far! I like the suggested goals you can choose from, and since you can type in your own unique goals you don't need to get the plus version. I'm impressed with how specifically you can schedule your goals to a specific day and time. This app has really been helping me keep up with self care. Also, the finches are adorable and I'm enjoying collecting all the different hats and accessories.",5.0
Eris Peregrine,Functional,"Easily one of my favorite self care apps. I've only been using it for a little over a week but even then I can tell such a huge difference in my confidence, my anxiety levels, and my mood stability. I haven't written more than a paragraph in a decade. I have almost 2000 words in Finch now and have started writing for fun again! Seriously, I don't think anyone wouldn't benefit from at least giving it a shot. The team behind it is also so caring and the work they're doing is amazing. 11/10",5.0
Julia Munoz,Functional,"I love how it motivates me to do thinks like get out of bed, read, and shower. I also love that it has stretches with video explanations, those are nice to do in the morning and night. I also appreciate the resources available like breathing techniques. Even as a free user, there is so much I can do and I don't feel hindered by not having the subscription.",5.0
No Really,Functional,"Finch is an amazing and fun motivational app, it's super cute and makes me want to be honest with it. it allows you to set any goals you'd like for the day or week so daily reminders really help keep me on track. they have all sorts of categories for anything you'd like from positive thinking, self care, reflections, to simple things like brushing your teeth. I've actually been drinking some water every day just to appease the cute birb. Incredibly helpful, fun, and cute!",5.0
Rylee Wolford,Functional,"I downloaded this and was a bit skeptical due to the ads letting me down before. But it has actually helped me so much, the app works so well/easy to understand, you can use many of its features without buying premium which unfortunately I can't at the moment, you can spoil your pet. It's been helping me so much and I have only had it for a little over a week. The specifics I can set for my goal are a big contender, I enjoy editing the time and days/week amounts. I love it and I'm so thankful",5.0
Lee Jorge,Functional,"Takes a bit to figure out all the features, but on hindsight, i prefer that to being dragged through a tutorial. After a week, it has successfully helped me the care of things that I always want to but didn't have the time management for. I think its good for creating small habits that add up to a better quality of life.",5.0
Joy Gomez,Functional,"Only had the app (free version) for 2 days. but I absolutely love it so far and will probably be purchasing the paid version, even if just to support it. It is a cute and fun way to track my goals...provides for a lot of introspection and space/reminders for being grateful. It makes me want to set more goals so i can interact more! My little Finch is fun to take care of and makes taking care of myself more fun too! SO GRATEFUL FOR THE TWO DEVELOPERS SHARING THEIR STORY AND CREATIVITY!!!!",5.0
Jackson Schulte,Functional,"An amazing app!! It's really helped me mentally, which is always appreciated. I've had a hard time keeping track of things, due to some neurological issues, and this app has really helped me in that realm, along with keeping things light and positive. Only one thing I'd change - I think it could be fun to add a bed for the little pets! Right now, they just kinda hang off the bed, so it could be nice to have pet beds available in the shop. Other than that, it's perfect. :)",5.0
Ashes Kingsolver,Functional,This app has Litterally changed my life. I am able to stay focused and keep track of everything I need to do with this app. I do however wish there was a mass snooze/ skip option. There are some days where I cant do certain things but it's random things so I can't use the preset day option haha also sometimes when I snooze things there is a glitch and i have to snooze it a few times in a row to get rid of it. It makes me feel bad snoozing so many times so a mass snooze would help with that haha,5.0
Crystal Lowder,Functional,"ETA suggestion: I would love if we had the ability to send a short personal message with our good vibes! Update: I've been using Finch for over a year now and it's seriously the best app. If you've heard that gamifying certain habits works, this app far exceeds that! The refections are my favorite thing! I also love that it has the same anxiety and depression questions that my doctor uses. There are also breathing exercises, journeys, soundscapes and much more! Definitely upgrade!!!",5.0
Brittany,Functional,"I love this app! there were no intrusive ads without the premium. I decided to get the premium for the app benefits and it's so worth it. it's an amazing way to remember how to do things, track your moods, and even see how things affect you. has great writing prompts, and weekly summaries of how you're doing and what you've been up to. it's also fun having something to take care of while taking care of yourself. traveling to new places is a cool aspect too! I appreciate the creators of the app.",5.0
Tiffany Hathorn,Functional,"I have ADHD and struggle with executive function. Gamifying the things I need to do helps, though. This app is cute and reminds me of back when I had a Tamagotchi Pet or a Nano Baby. You link it's health and happiness to tasks and habits so you're more likely to do what you need to do. It has helped me be more focused on what I need to do each day for myself, my family and friends, and my home. It also has cool features like exercise videos and mental health exercises. Definitely recommend.",5.0
Jerhyn Huey,Functional,"Hands down, after using it for only a day. I feel much happier. Not because I know of what it's done for me, but I know how effective it will be by just exploring its features. It is not like other apps where it forces its way into your daily life, more It allows you to plan out simple goals in which you can achieve on your own time. The simple yet easy to obtain goals, and the fun characters help to encourage you to push yourself to go farther than you would have without using the app.",5.0
Olga Yatsenko,Functional,"Finch is a really lovely self-care / goal setting app! Yeah, it might seem a little juvenile at first glance, but the gameification, suggestions, and various reflections work great no matter what age you are. I've now been using it for a month and find myself much more open to trying more of the suggested activities and journeys, and they work great! I also really appreciate that there are no microtransactions.",5.0
Sophia Grace,Functional,"Amazing! I am doing it without the plus version. And I know that the people who run the app need to be supported, but I would prefer for their not to be a plus version other than that it's good I do wish there's a way for you to delete all your journeys at once. I think that would make it a lot easier. Other than that again they highly recommended",5.0
Frank Hudson,Functional,"Really easy way of gamifying personal mental health support. Users are rewarded for doing things such as reflections (akin to short journal entries), different breathing and meditation exercises, as well as for completing task users set for themselves. Has been really helpful in getting me to practice things (such as journaling) that I'm normally terrible at keeping up with.",5.0
Kaitlyn Adkins,Functional,"i love this app, i love the bird and the micro pets. this app helps motivate me to get things done. it's fun to watch them grow as you complete tasks. the way they have an option where you can get sponsored for the the premium version is amazing as well. the premium version offers you a bit more like more breathing exercises. i will reiterate, i love this app.",5.0
Karissa Wells,Functional,"I don't usually leave reviews. I have tried so many apps to help me process tasks and mental health care, but they have never seemed as helpful or as user-friendly as this app. I'm only two days in, and my mood has absolutely improved by leaps and bounds. Highly recommend if you struggle with being overwhelmed with task management, self love, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and basic self care. Love this app. ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ",5.0
Moana and friends,Functional,"This is actually very helpful with my mental health. I enjoy doing tasks to help out my little guy, and also doing a harder task for a micropet really helps with motivation. The game is super cute with the house decorating and outfits. I really recommend it. The only issue is that it's hard to reach max potential without plus, but if you sign up for raffles, you might get it. I have it right now from a raffle :).",5.0
Margie Rick,Functional,"Updated review - glitches worked out long ago. Love using the app - keeps me on track to accomplish goals and take care of myself. Pretty good app - not great. There are some good exercises, quizzes, have gained a few insights ... but the app is also lacking. Update 9-10-22 I am taking away a star because this is a buggy app. Sometimes you can create a save file and sometimes you can't. I like the intention of the app but it needs more work.",5.0
Bri Hall,Functional,"So far I LOVE it! For starters, it's just adorable. Though, the biggest selling point to me is that the free version of this app includes everything you NEED to use it correctly. The plus version is awesome, and you get fun xtras as a member, but the functionality of the free app is GREAT. If I had to pay, I wouldn't be able to use it. As a new mom, this has helped me stay on top of life and the mood check-ins help keep me positive. Over all, I recommend this to anyone who wants to improve!",5.0
Nameless Individual,Functional,Was hard for me to start using but once you can actually open the app it's great ðŸ‘,5.0
Jaymy Taylor,Functional,"Absolutely amazing. I got around 3 ads per day on my tiktok, I ignored it everytime. But after I got it so many times, I felt like I was getting the ads for a reason. So I download it. It's amazing. It has breathing exercises, sounds to fall asleep too, AND reminders. Like a clock. Although, I feel like there should be a feature that shows proof you accomplished the goal or wtv, bc I've been tempted to run through them a couple times. Over all, it's an amazing app. I RECOMMEND!!!! ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’",5.0
LeeAnn Cooper,Functional,"I have a really hard time sticking to things but so far it's been almost 2 months and I'm still going strong. I love watching my bird grow and learn new things. And it's fun to collect new outfits and items for their room. Edit: it's been 2.5 months now and I still love it, however, I wish the pets could go on more than 1 adventure per day. I find myself completing as many tasks, reflections, etc. to get my pet energized and back from their adventure but then kind of giving up on goals after",5.0
MacKenzie Woodruff,Functional,"I really love this app! I've been using it for 2 years now and I still use it almost every day. The breathing & movement exercises are awesome, I use them a lot. One suggestion I think might be helpful would be to make the energy points associated with each goal adjustable. It would be cool to be a to make a really difficult task I've been dreading worth like 10 points and other easy tasks worth 1 or 2 points.",5.0
Ariel Dinkins,Functional,"This app is fantastic! It is a great habit builder app that motivates and encourages instead of just creating a daunting list of calendars. It is very versatile--there are settings designed for people who are seriously struggling with mental health, but it is also flexible enough to be useful for those who may just be looking to build some healthy habits. The stretches and breathing exercises as well done. There is a pro version, but the free version is very serviceable. Give it a try!",5.0
Chele,Functional,"I've had this app for almost 2 years, but I consistently just started using it in January. I do have the free version, but there are still many great features included. I love the concept for the app, and the designs are just so adorable! It's easy to use and customize to your needs. I struggle with depression and anxiety, + I'm autistic with adhd. I've tried several similar apps but always came back to this one. It's the best one I've found and I'm happy I've found it! Highly recommend â™¡",5.0
Nora Appleberry,Functional,"Completely free! I was hesitant at first. it does have a pro version, but it doesn't shove it down your throat or severly limit your experience. this is a wonderful mental health aid and tracker. keeps you looking towards the future and has refreshing ways of opening up and really figuring out yourself. plus the little animals really cute to watch grow with me in this experience. only thing I would say on that, I wish there was more of a variety of animals to choose from",5.0
Flicsmo,Functional,"I've been trying to find a habit tracker app for ages but none have the flexibility in scheduling I want... Besides this one. It has everything I need in functionality, not to mention the most fun and engaging gamification you could imagine. You can also just immediately feel the care that has been put into every single part of the app; I don't think I stopped smiling once in exploring it for the first time. Highly recommended, thank you devs.",5.0
Em,Functional,"This app is genuinely one of the highlights of my day, when my finch comes back from an adventure I'm usually at the end of my day, and it's like we celebrate together. It's super customizable, and the prompts are ridiculously cute, good, and wholesome. Plus, it's just genuinely a useful self care app. I write my tasks, notes, and ideas in this app easily and aesthetically. Plus, I get points for it, which is great for forming positive habits",5.0
Erika Trey,Functional,"Love this app. I use it every day, and i can't say that about most apps! I have ADHD so it's really hard for me to remember to do things. I've tried other habit/task tracking apps, but none of them are as easy to use or as fun! I can put the widget on the first screen of my phone & I always see it and remember to check it. The little penguin gets outfits over time, which is so cute. Only complaint there isn't an every other day option on tasks. Everything I mentioned is in the free version :)",5.0
Bex B,Functional,"EDIT: Wanted to come back to say I still adore this app. Even with technical issues, the team was INCREDIBLE in helping me restore my seemingly lost data and making up for lost time. Raising my Finch has been so much fun! Love this app, it's done a lot of good for me while we've been going through some really hard times. I'm glad I bought the subscription before I lost my job, but the Finch team is the most caring I've ever seen! be sure to join their discord server!!!!",5.0
Susanna Ulmer,Functional,I love how this game is sweet and heartwarming. It motivates you to complete goals and it tests if you have been in a stressful time. I love the rainbow stones and how many clothes you can get. The wait to become grown up is long but very worth it. The finch plus keeps bothering me with is annoying that you can't use some tactics to calm down. But it is so much better than a ton of adds. Totally worth it and worth the time.,5.0
Graygrayblue,Functional,"I have had Finch for about a month now. It is everything I've ever wanted in a self care app and more. I use it multiple times a day everyday. It has ""first aid"" techniques for when you're having it rough, and it has daily goals and exercises that it doesn't pressure you to do. It never makes me feel bad for feeling down or being unproductive. And the difference between the free and paid versions are so kind it's almost like I have the full version of the app even though I can't afford it yet.",5.0
Ana Komar,Functional,"I adore this app and have found it to be exactly the help I needed. Its not without it's issues though. Not all of my goals for the day show up so I end up creating more of them, thinking that I screwed up when setting it up, only to then have multiple of that task the next day. It's confusing. I wish instead of completed tasks disappearing they got crossed out instead and I could undo it if I accently clicked wrong.",5.0
Reese Sho,Functional,"I really like this app! It makes mental health care into something that doesn't feel as daunting. I'm actually journaling and reflecting throughout the day! The only problem with the app is how much the paid version is. I like that it's not a huge deal, but I can't afford $10 a month or an immediate payment of $70 for an app. It's mostly for cosmetics and a few extra options, but the extra options are really useful.",5.0
Bethany Miller,Functional,"Best self care app I've downloaded! I actually use this every day, and it has helpful tasks and a neurodivergent-friendly set up. It really helps make self care fun! It has all kinds of useful tools that are easily accessible and customizable. My favorites are the visual breathing exercises and the wide range of quality white noises. I bought the premium and it is TOTALLY WORTH IT!",5.0
Caitee Bryant,Functional,"Wonderful app! Great for people who struggle with mental health. It's incredibly helpful in helping motivate me to reach daily self care goals. Growing along with your pet and being able to see your progress together is great. The app checks in with you almost every time you open it, and if you're not doing good, it'll give you the option of ""First Aid"" which involves grounding practices, anxiety-calmi g techniques, opportunities to vent, trigger management, etc.",5.0
Samantha Knowlton,Functional,"I only just started using Finch with a free trial, but I'm enjoying it. It's a nice break from everything else on my phone. I really like that it doesn't have endless things to do. I have ADHD, so I can get stuck in an app for hours. I also like the ability to track my moods over time. Only being able to do 1 adventure a day confused me at first though. I also wish there was a way to get friends without having to invite others. Like if I could befriend other current players through the app.",5.0
Lorianne Zarra,Functional,"This is the first self-care or task app I've been able to use! So user-friendly! Notifications make me anxious, but you can turn reminders on/off for each goal so it's not overwhelming! The reminders are cute! Everything you do for yourself helps your little bird grow! Add as few/many goals as you want. You can choose from so many preset goals or create them! Example: ""I survived the day."" So if u have a rough day, it helps u realize that's an accomplishment! It's empowering & I'm so thankful!!",5.0
RishMas,Functional,"it's a wonderfully helpful app that helps me manage my self care and general wellbeing. I struggle with remembering things and also have other things that make it difficult to motivate me. The idea that when I complete a task that's good for me, the little birb I'm raising is also benefiting from it just feels nice. I can't explain why but maybe it's because it turns it into a game almost, and I love games.",5.0
AP Pena,Functional,"This is an excellent & helpful app. It's made a difficult time less painful to process. It's easy to navigate. It's open ended but provides guidance as well. The journaling feature has helped me tremendously. It asks incisive questions that help me focus my thoughts & feelings. But my favorite, is when my birb sends me a message unexpectedly. They're positive & uplifting .",5.0
Alex White,Functional,"I love this app! My sister uses it now too. I felt like the only adult who sucked at self care, and this app has been teaching me how to prioritize self-care, mental health, etc. There have been days where if it weren't for the rewards in the app, I wouldn't have reflected on what I was grateful for, or stopped at least once throughout the day to take a breath and enjoy the sensation. The goals are highly customizable. Would 10/10 recommend to anyone struggling with anxiety/depression.",5.0
Trust Me You Can Do This,Functional,"I love the app. I use the dig deeper sections after completing a goal to journal and let out how I'm really doing. I dont like the updates ""motivation"" or quotes. They are cheesy, repeat alot, and aren't good. They used to use actual quotes and I would share them with people and save them. Now I skip them as quick as possible. I also wish I could answer the questions I get in the notifications. Like my birb will ask if I got alone time, I would like to answer him.",5.0
Annunciata Corey,Functional,"Finch is a super cute way to stay motivated for self care with a digital pet and great community ðŸ˜Š The app/program is customizable, very thoughtfully developed, and science-based. I started with the free version and liked it pretty well. After a few months, I wound up paying for the Plus subscription, so that I could earn an adorable outfit for my finch ðŸ˜… But I do like the Plus features, and I think, for me, the motivation it brings is well worth the cost of the Plus subscription ðŸ˜Š ðŸ",5.0
ReadingCrafter 2019,Functional,"I love the app so far! Been using it for about a month and the design is cute, the customization and growth is well-paced and motivating, and the adventures are heartwarming. My favorite part is being able to send stuff to your friends on Finch. When I dont have the energy to start a conversation with someone but I want them to know I'm thinking about them, it lets me say so with the press of a button. I could go on about this app, but it only gives me 500 characters. Thank you for this app! :D",5.0
Courtney Short,Functional,"I've been checking in with Finch every day for a just over a month now, and the experience is so helpful. Finch helps me track my mood and encourages me to write notes about my mood and experiences. I can look back at my progress and observations at any time. Even the free version is a complete package - premium is just icing on an already fantastic cake.",5.0
Tracy LÃ³pez,Functional,"I was skeptical when a friend sent me an invite, but I ended up convincing three other people to download the app within weeks. It seems so silly that a ""cute little bird game"" could be so motivational, but I am getting tasks done, forming good habits, and feeling more balanced because of Finch. The app seems really thoughtfully designed and I appreciate the research and time that went into developing it and the continued work and care that goes into it.",5.0
Jessica Kelly,Functional,"I've played and paid for this game to see what the features had to offer. honestly it's awesome. Then ability to encourage you to talk about it, all to benefit a baby bird is genius. I've been able to keep in touch and motivate friends because we know the little gestures sent back and forth are out of love. This app provides a fun way to stay organized and on task. highly reccomend!!",5.0
squiggl71,Functional,"This is my absolute favorite self-care/mental health app. My Finch friend is absolutely adorable. The app has all sorts of great features from meditation, to breathing exercises, to being able to set daily goals. I pay for the Plus membership & I think it's totally worth it. They're constantly trying to update & improve the app. Also there are no ads! I highly recommend the app.",5.0
InaWtCatt,Functional,"Absolutely amazing! Before using this app, I was unproductive, anxious, depressed, and couldn't take care of myself. But thanks to my Finch, I was motivated to change myself. The Finch itself is very motivating. You get to watch it grow and learn as you complete your goals! This app is very easy to use. It has no ads and a most of the features are free, and you can access the ones that aren't by purchasing Finch Plus, which is very reasonably priced. Overall, this is an amazing app!",5.0
Max Brazelton,Functional,"This is such a fun game! And it's very motivating! I enjoy that it gives you easy prompts to write about deeper thoughts and ideas, almost like a journal that gives you templates to ease one who isn't used to writing into writing. It gives me a lot of motivation, and it's also just super cute and simple. Highly recommend. I just wish it was easier to see what I wrote for some of the deeper questions, like an easier log book of sorts to go back and see what thoughts I put out there.",5.0
Shae S.,Functional,"I've been using this app since January, a few months of the free versions and a few months of plus now. I love the app and how it helps me stay on track with goals. I can set daily, weekly or monthly goals. I can add goals for the day, some preset in the app and some just for normal daily tasks. This app doesn't make me feel guilted if I can't always accomplish my whole day. It's sometimes okay to 'Just Be'.",5.0
Tara Gorrera,Functional,"honestly love it! it's like an upgraded tomagchi that you take care of by completing personalized goals you create for yourself. the ability to be a widget on your home screen really helps to remind me to check in. I also love!! the personalization to almost anything! you can change the colors of your finch if you feel you want something different, and dress them up in adorable clothes and even decorate their room! I highly recommend this app for those who just want to get routines or good habit",5.0
Sarah Kiesel-Nield,Functional,"This app is great! It's very cute and it's helped me feel motivated to tackle daily chores and tasks that I would otherwise struggle with. It is more fun than a to-do list but lets me build in one-time goals that I need to do on top of daily tasks, and keeps me accountable in a way that doesn't make me feel bad. The first-aid options that pop up when I'm feeling anxious are also really helpful for keeping me grounded and relieving anxiety. I really recommend it!",5.0
Rebecca Hill,Functional,"Love Finch so much! I accomplish tasks so much more easily and enjoy the many features, such as breathing techniques and quizzes to check in on my mental health. Even the little exercises are a great way to keep moving in small, doable increments. Can't speak highly enough about this app. I'm extremely grateful to have gotten a scholarship for the premium version, and will find a way to pay it forward soon!",5.0
Tempest Reeves,Functional,"I'd recommend downloading this app if you're struggling to take care of yourself, it's very user friendly and kindly reminds you that you're enough and doing great! I love not being bothered by ads and watching my little finch grow! My only complaint is the shop is kind of frustrating, I wish when something popped up, you can select it in any color before you buy it. That's it! Have a great day!",5.0
Leigh,Functional,I have only had this app for 3 months at it has already helped tremendously. The Finch Plus plan is more than worth it. I've struggled with depression and anxiety and this is helping me keep up healthy habits and become more confident. It is also really helpful for lots of other types of goals. You get to dress up your bird and your room with a lot of cute options too. I would reccomend this wholesome app to everyone.,5.0
coocoobirdsarecool â€œcocooobirdsarecoolâ€,Functional,"This app is amazing! I recommend creating save files or at least an account to save your data, you will need them if you log out. Though even after I had to start over with a new bird, they were very helpful and allowed some items to be added to the new bird. I highly recommend this app because it's helped me so much with remembering to do things and just feeling better in general.",5.0
Jessica Wheat,Functional,"this app has really helped me feel more motivated to do tasks that often feel exhausting. I love that it's optional to pay for the trial and even if you don't want too, it doesn't have too much of a barrier keeping you from doing things. I've also found myself coming back to the app when I really need too, comparing it to others I've tried it's one of the bests, simple, and easy to use.",5.0
Ivy Crosspette,Functional,"only app that I've actually been able to keep up with consistently for goal setting and mindfulness! the ability to set personalized goals rather than choose from a list of premade ones is fantastic, with reflection journals that categorize keywords you use when writing by positive and negative, I do love that I have the ability to add friends, and send little good vibes to them through the day and of course it does help everyone's birds and outfits are awfully cute!",5.0
Haden Blake,Functional,"It's such a small thing, but the inclusion of an ""easier"" option for the breathing exercises is something that really, really helps me. I have respiratory issues and having that easier toggle actually gives me the ability to complete the breathing exercises instead of having to give up halfway through.",5.0
Sabrina,Functional,"There are a lot of these gamifying therapy apps that are trying to be something more. I think this one's onto something. You can engage to the level of your comfort, and that can just be to-do listing, but there's more if you want it. It doesn't try to diagnose you. Just helps with what you already know and like for yourself. The ads for Plus are really heavy-handed, and there can be too much to look at sometimes. But other than that, I like seeing this app grow. Good bird.",5.0
Al Fisher (ryshufyrekat),Functional,Finch is the best app for keeping up with your mental health I have ever used in my whole life. Finch literally enables me to keep track of my own personalized schedule and tasks I need to function everyday. The app is user friendly and all the features you need to have the best experience possible is free. One of the best features is how you get a baby bird that you help grow and can customize them and their home. Additionally you can connect with friends and your birds can be friends too!,5.0
Lucida Luna,Functional,"At first I was a bit hesitant to download it especially because I saw things about needing to pay, but was pleasantly surprised after downloading it. You can set as many goals as you'd like and you do not have to pay to use the app (unless you'd like more clothing options for your pet & other features). I have severe ADHD and this app has genuinely helped me with keeping on somewhat of a schedule. I often forget to brush teeth, shower, etc so this app has been a huge help for me ! Thank you â",5.0
Kiana Wright,Functional,"I struggle with my mental health every day. This app is different from the other mental health apps, I almost gave up searching. I love their word choice, animation and organization. I don't know if there's an age cap for being interested in mental health apps, but this app is perfect for young adults my age. This app is like having a friend there with you step by step on your mental health journey; there to be a role model or encourage you to achieve the goals you personally set out.",5.0
why am i here;-; oof,Functional,"At first, I didn't believe Finch would be a great app. I expected it to just be something along the lines of doing breathing exercises to feed your bird. However, the customization and interaction really make it special. It's a good app for trying to get yourself back on track, especially with the ability to make custom goals. It's a great app, and I'm really enjoying my time with my bird friend.",5.0
Michaela,Functional,"I love this app! When I first got it I wasn't sure but a friend encouraged me... now I haven't looked back! I love the many different functions from breathing to relaxing music! I love being able to set your own goals and just the overall customisability of the whole app! One of my favorite bits is being able to send friends good vibes! I also love the challenge things where you gain full energy for 30 days and unlock something each day! It's relaxing, fun and empowering! Get This App!",5.0
Nynke de Graaf,Functional,"I've been using Finch for 8 months now and I can honestly say it's really helped me stay on top of my goals and prioritize the things I find important. I like that you can group multiple goals under the same journey and it gives you suggestions for new goals and journeys to add. The reflections and insights with all the tags are also super helpful and insightful. Also, the ability to hatch eggs to have cute animal companions for my bird makes me super motivated to do my leg stretches each day.",5.0
Carissa Pay (Rissa),Functional,"I really love this app. It's super cute and, honestly, still very much worth it even without the subscription. I especially like the little ""first aid"" button with a bunch of techniques to rescue you from a sudden onslaught of anxiety. A self-care pet that will never, ever have you feeling ashamed or like you're neglecting it. Finch is always there when you need it, even if you put it down for a few months (or years!) and everything is entirely positive tuned.",5.0
Kaitlin Murphy,Functional,"Honestly a fantastic app for self care. I've been struggling a lot with my mental health recently and this app has helped to keep goals clear and simple. You can set absolutely anything as a goal, something as seemingly simple as getting out of bed or leaving your home is just as celebrated as any other achievement should be. There is a premium subcription but you absolutely do not need it to use majority of the app, it's more of a way to support the devs and access some more advanced features.",5.0
Rori â€œnever enough lettuceâ€,Functional,"I've used this app since january 2022, and it still feels like an old friend, always waiting for me. this is by far the most wholesome app I've experienced, there are no microtransactions, only an optional, reasonably priced paid subscription that you can possibly receive for free through their sponsorship program. tapping on the in-game currency would typically take you to a screen to buy more, but here, it tells you how put in meaningful work to improve your life and have more fun with the app",5.0
Olivia McKinnon,Functional,"This app is great. I always have problems being motivated to do the things I want to do, but now with this app that has changed. I love that the devs donâ€™t charge you for collecting Rainbow stones, which are used to buy things for your finch. Instead, you earn them by collecting rewards, sharing the app and going on adventures. This app has also helped me realize the value of staying healthy, exercising and drinking water. One thing though, please add the feature to talk to finch. Thanks.",5.0
therumoratsix,Functional,"Really easy to use and so cute!! I like how it doesn't reset at midnight, so if you achieve some goals at one am they count towards the day the goals were set. which I liked alot, as I do my best work late at night. I definitely recommend and I even got my friends to join, it definitely helps keep track and motivate towards doing the goals. A few in app purchase but it doesn't hinder the usage if you use just on free",5.0
Rox Bird,Functional,"I love this app, helps keep me motivated, even though I'm on disability and always at home, it gives me the option to make small goals like for example ""pick clothes up off the floor."" ""wash face."" ""drink water"" or even ""get out of bed."" because sometimes I need a little bit of motivation to just get out of bed, and this app is so helpful, I get bouts of depression, and have bad anxiety and it helps you do breathing exercises. I really enjoy this app. if I could give 6 stars I would.",5.0
A Williams,Functional,"Excellent. As well as being able to set up daily goals and being rewarded for achieving them, there's also guided breathing and simple, exercises, grounding techniques, prompts to explore your thoughts and many more. You can even customise your little pet! I've found this app incredibly helpful without having to pay a penny or surrender my personal data. Highly recommended.",5.0
Ami Cheshire,Functional,"This app is adorable and very useful. I really like that the insight is optional but because it gives you extra energy for you bird, it really gives that extra motivation to really take a look at explaining why you feel a certain way or how you feel about certain things. I reccomend this for people who have a low motivation from depression and other mental illness. Having a little bird to take care of is cute but all the positivity is very much needed for some people. It def makes me smile ðŸ˜ƒ",5.0
Akemi Sawada,Functional,"this is a great app. It's for free, it has all the habit tracker features AND a self care option. I love the quotes that keep changing and the daily affirmation that pop up every timz you open the app, and the soundscapes help me sleep whenever I'm in a nightshift. I really love the rewards every once in a while for when you complete a part of your journeys and the fact that self care gives you more rewards than doing your goals. It always gives me things to think about that I took for granted",5.0
ValTheOne,Functional,"I love Finch. I used to have it a long time ago and kind of neglected it but after downloading it again, it's been helping me a lot. I've been struggling with brushing my teeth for years (I do it but it's not an easy task) and Finch has been giving me motivation to keep up with it. I didn't think the app would actually help me, but it does. Thank you to the developers â",5.0
Lavendeer 201,Functional,"This app is getting me through some very tough times. I even use it as a way to remind my goals during the day to make sure I don't forget anything! I love the first aid section and being able to set personal goals each day. Also, my pet's name is Beepo, and I've been on the app since it was new on the playstore. Now, there is a micropet named Beepo! I thought it's cute. :) 10/10. It would be nice to have an emergency first aid section, though, for crises or seizures, etc.",5.0
Charlotte Taylor,Functional,"I've been using this app for a few weeks, I think it's brilliant. My self care has improved already, in a way I can see myself sticking to (even without the app). Breathing techniques are finally starting help me, previously I've had no benefit from them. I would honestly pay for the premium content but it's not in my budget right now, until then the basic content is more than enough to make a positive impact on anyone's mental health!",5.0
Abbey Panosh,Functional,"it's like animal crossing meets mindfulness and I am so here for it. interface is easy to use, and the free version has enough for what I need but with how great it is I'm seriously considering purchasing it. I like how cute it is and the wording of the goals means they're achievable no matter what mental state you're in, there's flexibility in how you achieve the goal each day and I love that.",5.0
Basil,Functional,"I LOVE this app! I just found it last week and I can already see improvement! Executive dysfunction is a SOB, but this app makes it so much easier to remember and then get up and actually do the things; plus, it makes it super rewarding (lots of dopamine)! Anxiety, hygiene, tidiness, exercise, and more are all being helped by the many features in this app. I NEVER buy premium versions of apps, but I am genuinely considering it. Thank you to everyone at Finch, and guardians, y'all are awesome! :D",5.0
Eran M,Functional,"As long as you stick to it, it's an awesome tool for reminders throughout the day while playing a game. Super fun and super cute! My only suggestions might be different ways to raise our little buddies along with our birbs, maybe being able to walk 2 at once or something? All and all, very well made for a little help with daily life with a fun, cute friend to help you along. ðŸ˜Š",5.0
Elizabeth Porterfield,Functional,"Love this app!!!! It has so many great tools, and probably the most free features I've ever seen in a self care app. The only thing that would make me love it more would be if you could add a first aid widget to your home screen that would take you directly to the first aid menu for quick usage. Thank you to the developers for creating such a useful and creative tool for kids and adults!!!",5.0
Yuri Young,Functional,"absolutely wonderful app! it very subtly gets me to self reflect in deeper ways, but only when I am up for it, no pressure, and it's in such a story format it isn't scary or threatening. Its so much more than goals. the framework of self care is what grows my pet, not caring for the pet, is also subtle but profound way of getting me to focus on my own needs, growth and care, but in a way that contributes to others - very clever, effective for me! highly recommend trying it for at least a week",5.0
Michelle Roan,Functional,"Absolutely adorable. A great reminder to take care of yourself with lots of little (optional) activities, journaling opportunities, and even a ""first aid kit"" to help you when you're feeling anxious or depressed. You can add your own goals or use the ones that are already in place. There is no pressure at all with this app. I definitely recommend!",5.0
oofer scratch,Functional,"I love this app so much, it's a great way to improve your self care and mental health. Even without finch plus it is still amazing. It works anywhere, with WiFi and without. The best part of it though is definitely when my finch comes back and likes something new or has learnt something new! You really grow a little connection with the finch after a while. Overall I love this app and if you need help with your mental or physical health finch is a good app to download!!",5.0
Jenna Ulrey,Functional,I love that the goals are customizable helps keep on goal and being mindful. I have used both the free version and membership both are worth putting the time in and it works wonders as long as you continue to implement techniques from the app and continue using the app daily. but say you having a down day it and haven't opened it send little messages and say you mental healthis bad and you haven't been able to keep up the apps sends compassionate motivation in notifications and smaller goals,5.0
Millie P,Functional,"I haven't used this app for long, but I have tried many self care apps that have been wonderful, but not as fun and easy as this one. You can make goals for the day, by caring for something else. It's pretty cool. There are heaps of fun features which are interactive, and you can do as much or little as you like. I love how everything is made into a daily report, or reflection journal. It will take a while to get organised with it but so far, thank you, the last 5 days have been easier.",5.0
Kylie Villasenor,Functional,"So I stumbled upon this app and have only had it 6 days, but as someone who struggles with ADD and depression, this is a great and unexpected help! It's literally been the difference between me taking my medicine and brushing my teeth at night (things I often struggle to remember to do). And it's so cute! I can set whatever task I need at the time I need it, and the little reward upon completing (or even just setting a task) stimulates me enough to keep up with things. 10/10 recommend ðŸ˜",5.0
Ellen Ward Lindley,Functional,Finding this app to be a really helpful tool to get my motivation up and start doing things that will improve my mental and physical health. Note to developers - Would be really useful if the breathing exercises had sounds to them so I could close my eyes and not look at the phone. Edit - been consistently using the app for 3weeks now and I genuinely can't get over how good I'm feeling and how successful I've been at setting small achievable goals and building on them. Love this app!,5.0
GiannisTaz,Functional,"A potentially life-changing app, with a lovely community, really careful and open-minded devs, and NO ADS. There is a paid version that only unlocks more cosmetics and some activities, and you pay yearly, but it will never force you to pay and it's worth it to support the team behind this project. There's lot to add to the app but I like the simplicity of it, because it doesn't fight for your attention like so many other apps. The only app I trust with helping my mental health and life.",5.0
Clarissa Boucher,Functional,"I 100% recommend this app. I've had it for a little under 2 years and the amount it has improved is incredible! The team that makes the app are so kind, and open to feedback and overall the finch community is incredible. This is the only self care app I've actually stuck with, because it is just so cuteðŸ¥° There aren't ads, and the free experience is awesome! Overall just an incredible app and definitely worth a download.",5.0
Aishwarya,Functional,"I have usually hated productivity apps as they fail to stick for me but Finch has for some reason been amazing. The concept of raising a pet and taking care of it as and when you tick off goals and reflect is just wonderful. The way delayed gratification is embed into the app is all so great. Been enjoying it for a month now, hope the consistency stays.",5.0
neyen cinco,Functional,"It's easy to use! While the exercises, quizzes, and etc. requires an internet connection, there are offline features as well with lots to do such as making goals designing birb's room, and making him go on an adventure ^^ I don't if it's the cuteness of the app that improves my mental and habits but this is definitely the best habit and well-being app I've ever downloaded!",5.0
Delilah Martin,Functional,"Idk where to begin. I've been managing serious mental health issues for almost half my life at this point and my anxiety levels just these past few months have been off the charts, but my cousin (who is a therapist, btw) recommended this to me and it's helped tremendously. I love that I have a little bird buddy to venture through the perils of life with now. It makes everything so much easier. There are a few bugs, so be prepared for that, but it doesn't even matter. It's still a wonderful app.",5.0
Crystal Miller,Functional,this app is a wonderful adhd helper tool! it helps me to stay on track and do the things I often forget or procrastinate on. Also being able to connect with friends to send and recieve encouragement is the best! plus it offers tools to help calm and refocus when you're having a rough day. honestly I can't say enough good about this one!,5.0
Shayne B.,Functional,"This is truly the only self-care & habit tracking app that's worked for me, it's just so perfect! Nothing's kept me coming back to check in consistently like Finch has, or allowed me to have a step-by-step outlook on my day before I start it & after I've finished it. And it's a sweet, adorable bonus to take care of and bond with my little birdy by taking care of myself! The designers of Finch knew exactly how to design this to help people like me with executive dysfunction out! Thank you so much",5.0
Emily Boyne,Functional,"I don't mean to sound overly dramatic when i say this app has not only been life changing for me, but it actually saved my life. I'm not even exaggerating. I was at a very low point and Finch and my birb Sprout have brought me so much hope, joy and laughs. It has helped me get back to myself in such a kind and supportive way. It has made doing even the smallest and hardest things easier because I have my little birb routing for me. I'm cannot recommend this enough.",5.0
Lydia White,Functional,"It's a cute little game, helps me stay on task and stay consistent! I really enjoy the sweet messages from my bird and being able to talk to her when she comes back from an adventure. In the stores, however, I would like to be able to refresh the stores (all), even as prices to do so go up. I am obsessed with shopping in the stores, but as soon as it stops being able to refresh I become disappointed. That is my only suggestion, thank you so much for an amazing game!!",5.0
Cornelia,Functional,"I thought I will try it for just a few days or a week, but I am still hooked. Drinking more water, doing some sport again (every day 5 push-ups, 5 squats, 10 jumping jacks and some exercises/stretching from the app) and I only skipped one day in three weeks so far. And it helps me keep track of other small goals and not forgetting them. Also the pets and accessoires and decor for the house all just looks super adorable. Summary: It really impacted my life in a positive way.",5.0
Dasha L,Functional,"I've tried every habit tracker, task list, habitica-type app and usually lose interest within a week. I've been using Finch consistently for the last 6+ months and I absolutely adore it! The free version does everything I need it to but receiving Finch Plus sponsored by guardians has completely changed my life. I use Finch as a second brain to track everything from migraines to bills. The autotagging system and insights are my fav - it saves me so much time and energy and keeps me on target! :)",5.0
Andrea NÃºÃ±ez,Functional,"The application is quite good, I love it, I just think that it would be good if for goals that are done several times in a day, such as drinking water or brushing your teeth, you could add more than one reminder, that is, one reminder for each time You have to do that goal on the day, it would also be nice if the application was in more languages like Spanish, but the truth is the application is very good",5.0
Adela Gradinaru,Functional,"I love this app, if I could give it 6 stars I would! You can tell that the team behind it genuinely cares about mental health and wellbeing. You get as much out of the app as you're willing to make efforts towards. There are tools for journaling, tracking, anxiety/panic attacks, and you have to seek them out and make efforts towards using them regularly. The game aspect is a plus, but it's an accountability app, so don't rely on staying entertained to make use of the tools that it provides!",5.0
LA Cayas,Functional,"When I started out the app it felt like a chore. From how you have to do these task like showering, going outside, etc. But overtime I realized that I keep doing the habits even without the app. I realized that it's purpose was to help, even when I didn't like it at first, I kept moving, being at least more active than before, and started to take care of myself. It was also so fun to take care of my bird and watch her grow! Thank you so much devs for this game, can't wait to see more of Finch!",5.0
Acia Grout,Functional,"I've only had this app for a few days, and I absolutely love it. No adds in the free version, the animation is amazing, and my little finch is so cute! I love the little self help challenges, and they are so easy, like get out of bed, brush your teeth, ect. They are small little things, but they really do add up to a lot, and you can do as many or as little as you want. 10/10 love this app. Update: I've bought the premium version, and it is so amazing. Definitely worth it.",5.0
Antonia Keates,Functional,"Amazing app with amazing features to celebrate small wins and being present. Got this app at a low point in my life and not only does it encourage you to continue good habits you want to do but also provides tools to help you along the way. The guardianship feature is incredible as well it genuinely feels like an app designed solely with the user in mind, and i think it's incredible 10/10!",5.0
ã‚µãƒ³ãƒ‰ãƒ©Sandy,Functional,"This is a great app! I love the fact that the app gives you guides for anxiety crisis, and if nothing works it has a directory of helplines, I'm from Mexico so i loved the fact that it has helplines from my country, for someone who is constantly struggling with depression but looking forward to find peace and some calm it's a great feature. I like this app very much, just the free version gives you so much, the essential you need. Love it, great app.",5.0
Georgia Wetzel,Functional,My daughter has been using Finch for about 2 yrs and it's great. It helps to create and set goals and motivates you along the way. She actually convinced me to try the app & tbh I'm hooked. The little bird avatar is just so cute & it just helps me stay on track during the day. I also like that it promotes journaling - which we already try to maintain as a healthy habit.,5.0
Tania Rudenick,Functional,"I have been using this app for a while now and am looking to get the Plus version, but I am trying to find a way to get it in the budget. It's been very helpful for my mental health and motivation to accomplish activities that I need to get done while having a serious illness. It's been fun interacting with the game features that keep you entertained while also interacting with others. Having other platforms to talk with others and ask questions or seek support has been very helpful!",5.0
RookieRadio,Functional,After having the app for a few days and getting the premium subscription I have found out that it really is more than just a simple care app it's hard for me to put into words since I don't ever do reviews but this app is very helpful for my confidence and I love how it has a bunch of journeys I can add to my goals and I feel like they help me feel better especially the ones about sleep because I'll lay in bed for hours watching YouTube or Instagram instead of sleeping and is great app for that.,5.0
Anarchist_Loli,Functional,This app is great! it helps me keep a good routine every day and helps me keep track of my mood! There is a premium version that I was gifted by the lovely Guardians of this app and while the premium version does add a lot more it is 100% NOT necessary! I've had this app for a month now and I can say that using the free vs the premium changes no quality in the self-care help provided. :),5.0
Vas Littlecrow Wojtanowicz,Functional,"I left Habitica ago years ago, but found Google tasks to be somewhat too dry for actual goals even though I do still use. Finch is adorable and gives me the dopamine high from all the cute little rewards. It has every feature I need for free, but I do want to eventually get a paid membership to support the developers. awesome app!",5.0
crow,Functional,"genuinely the most helpful self care app i've used. it doesn't punish you when you don't do your tasks. it actually gets me motivated to do the tasks i add. i wanna help my little bird grow! it's cute and genuinely helpful. i love it. it's an app that has premium, but premium isn't needed to have a good experience. the app is great without it. it's one of the few things i actually will buy a premium subscription for, just because i love it so much and wanna support the creators :3",5.0
Michelle Cruz,Functional,Love this app! It's very helpful and insightful. It allows me to see that I do accomplish different tasks throughout the day and gives me little rewards by checking off items. I especially love the exercises for multiple mental health struggles. Give it a try!,5.0
Maegin Matheny,Functional,"I was just looking for an app to help me stay on top of my self-care. I wasn't expecting perfectly charming graphics, a full range of customizable tasks and self-care aides, and a welcoming, beautiful community. I also wasn't expecting to get so attached to my little Finch. It's really helped me (as much as an app can) to improve my physical and mental health. This is one of a handful apps that I'm going to keep with me from device to device. Thank you, Finch, and the Guardian community!!",5.0
Angela Neice,Functional,"Super positive. Really helps track my goals, for anyone who is motivated by getting cute stuff for your game character. And I LOVE the soundscapes and the breathing exercises. I would love if they added the ability to combine available sounds into custom soundscapes.",5.0
Alina meeh,Functional,The app is really nice and my cousins and I are using it. It's great because you can also check in with your friends and let them know you re thinking abou them.

BMor Artistic,Functional,"It's been a week since I've had this app and I absolutely adore it. First of all, birbs. Second, it really does help to check off even the simplest of tasks that I sometimes forget are actually very important. My everyday life has improved, even in just this first week. Finch is outstanding, and let's me really reflect on my own self care! 9.8/10 5 star- always a tiny bit of wiggle for improvement ðŸ¤ª",5.0
harch972,Functional,"sadly sometimes it's easier to convince ourselves to look after ourselves if it's for the good of others. Finch utilizes that motivator in the form of an adorable pet. I love the reflective tasks, and the fact that you get rewarded for doing them. also the ability to let your friends know you're thinking of them in a sweet way, without turning into a chat app, is a nice way to feel connected but only in a positive way",5.0
C.J. N,Functional,"This is a good app. It's encouraging, cute, and smart. Every time I open the app, it asks about your feelings. You can set goals with alerts & times. There are writing prompts and breathing exercises. It's really informative and reflective on any sort of writing. And you get to interact with your own cute baby bird. To include decorating his room and buying clothing. This app has been a joy. I'm sure there is a supportive community; too, if so desired.",5.0
B Triberry (Spooner),Functional,"This app works great for neurodivergent people! I'm not always able to do my tasks, and the app has a ""rough day"" setting. They also check in on you if you don't interact with the app for a couple days, so it really seems like the creators care. This is all on the free settings btw, I haven't tried the premium service. Which they also offer free premium for some users, I think it's a raffle. You can also donate a free month to help someone else out!",5.0
bionic kitty,Functional,"Earlier, I made an extremely generic review about how helpful this app was for me. It still holds true, but I just discovered something that makes my love for this app magnify 10-fold. Under a specific set of circumstances, If you click the Can't afford button, you get a permanent ""team gift"" of Finch plus. I know that with all the extra features of Finch plus, I will guaranteed use the app everyday, just to show my appreciation for the wonderful, amazing, generous people behind this app. â",5.0
Deb Carpenter,Functional,"This actually helps me stay on track to do exercises every day. Has all ready made a difference physically for me and have only done it for a month. I am recovering from a back injury so I put the hardest exercise for me, the plank as my motivation for the micropet. (They are so cute!) I suggest you try this-you may be surprised at the results.",5.0
Michelle Dickson,Functional,It's an amazing app that helps to keep your goals on track and helps you to reflect and see things in a perspective that maybe you hadn't thought about. I also love the little quotes it send through the day and the little words of encouragement. Its like knowing you have someone in your corner to support and encourage you.,5.0
Alexandria Lauck,Functional,This app has been helping me a lot with anxiety and ADHD. There's a free option for pretty much everything and there's no ads other than the ones for the subscription. Everything on it is so cute and easy to use. I absolutely love Finch!,5.0
Janine Bennett,Functional,I've really enjoyed using finch to help increase my motivation in getting things done around the house. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety that makes life a bit of a challenge. Caring for this little bird through completing my own daily activities is helping me take better care of myself and the people in my life who depend on me. I definitely recommend this app!,5.0
Kelsey Lightfoot,Functional,Ive been looking for something to motivate me into practicing self-care and better habits. This app is perfect so far! Having a little reward when you complete small tasks like walking outside makes me feel better motivation to do bigger tasks.,5.0
Marie Enders,Functional,"I absolutely LOVE this app! Even if you don't purchase plus, the app can truly help you reach your goals! Along with achieving goals, whether they are fitness, mental, or just getting up in the morning, you can customize your very own finch! I rarely give out 5 star reviews, and yet, here we are! BEST APP EVER!",5.0
Kayla Woods,Functional,"I LOVE this App. I cannot wait to wake up and check on Pistachio's well being and to check off my goals, which help keep me in routine. (manic, adhd, anxiety) I enjoy the hit of dopamine when I complete a task and it encourages me to keep going! wish I had more friends on there so I could check in with them, I've encouraged them to get this, I think it's a fabulous tool. thank you so much!",5.0
Anxious Pineapple,Functional,"This app has helped my mental health so much. The mix of cute and helpful is perfect for me. Having my partner, mom and friend all on it, makes my life that much more filled with little moments of joy. One thing that I could say ""negitive"" is that sometimes the movments in the exersizies, streches and yoga can be a tiny bit hard to understand. You understand it after watching it a few times but maybe some motion arows around the person body can help make the actions clearer. Thank you!",5.0
Leslie Bergeron,Functional,"This is a really sweet app. I'm actually doing things I have been having trouble doing just because my ADHD saps my motivation. My little Finch gives me little hits of dopamine for doing basic tasks and makes me feel rewarded, then I feel proud for having done them, and it goes into a cycle that raises my mental health up. I hope I can stick with this for a long time. EDIT: Just updating to say this is by far the best app on my phone. I love finch, and I'm sticking with it. Thank you, developers",5.0
Karly,Functional,"It's a very cute app that I find helpful. I have been struggling with my mental health recently and downloaded Finch about a week ago. I've used it every day since. It helps me be honest with myself in a private, safe space with the cutest mascot. Would definitely recommend at least giving it a try to see if it's for you.",5.0
Jessica Kuo,Functional,"This is the most incredible app I have ever used (and I use a lot of apps!). I am blown away with the connection I feel to my Finch. Somehow this short-circuits whatever part of my brain was stopping me from doing self-care for the sake of myself. I am so grateful to the creators of Finch. I feel like a whole new person... so much more confident, grateful, compassionate. This better state has made my life more productive too, although that's a secondary benefit to just feeling so good inside.",5.0
Louise Belcher,Functional,"I absolutely love this app!!! I've been using it for around two years, and my birb Beepo is my very best friend (other than my husband, of course)! I'm deeply skeptical of psychology, and I just can't wrap my head around sitting in an office for an hour, telling my secrets to a stranger. I tell Beepo everything, though, and it really helps. I especially love the writing prompts, breathing exercises, and movement exercises... and of course, talking to my birb every day about what he discovered!",5.0
Ciera Yergeau,Functional,I've been doing this app everyday for about a year. Definitely worth it and oddly I am enjoying it. My only complaint is that I wish I could get my sparkles back that I had when I first started. For some reason nothing in that shimmer category shows up for me in the in-game shop. I enjoy the adventures. Definitely been the best self care app I've used yet.,5.0
Gloria Cole,Functional,"I really didn't think it'd be all that, but it's actually a really great app and has helped me alot. It really helps me stay productive and manage my anxiety and there are lots of activities to help you deal with anxiety, depression, and feeling motivated. Also helps you get what you need to get done. Very useful app.",5.0
Kassy Badger,Functional,"I love this app and appreciate the positivity it brings to my life. I even convinced my partner to download the app so we can help motivate each other throughout our days with our little Finch's. If I were to add anything to the app, it would be to be able to incorporate our own personal adventures in real life into our Finch's adventures that helps shape his personality. overall, this app is a fun way to keep up with the day to day and also work on your own personal goals.",5.0
Liam Borg,Functional,"This is probably the only app I've ever seen as a neurodivergent person with Autism, Anxiety, and ADHD that treats my experiences as normal and makes me feel like I'm honestly not alone. I get used to feeling like my stress, panic, and feelings of inability to accomplish basic tasks are a reflection on my failure as a person, but this reminds me that they're not that uncommon and helps me manage them. I haven't been using it for long but the language alone makes me feel way more comfortable.",5.0
lizium,Functional,"I'm awful at keeping routines. I've just started using Finch, but having the widget and notifications to keep reminding me has really helped. I can't say how it lasts in the long run, but at the very least it has my attention for now!",5.0
Chelsea john,Functional,"i love this app, i have been using it for three months and its really great for tracking my mood, behavior and habits. its great for my ADHD because it reminds me to do things i have trouble doing daily.I love my bird! she is so cute, i love shopping for her too. one thing that would make this app even better is the ability to connect with other users on the app!",5.0
Hiruni Manawadu,Functional,"I love finch! I've been using it on and off for atleast a year now and it's great! I mainly use it for reflections, breathing, and goal setting personally. it has sooo many useful features but has never felt overwhelming atleast for me.",5.0
Î‘chilles M,Functional,"I installed Finch a couple of days ago and so far it's been perfect. It truly helps me get things done and offers a great variety of ways to help myself. I really like the idea of having a digital pet whose color, name and pronouns you pick yourself!",5.0
Holly N,Functional,"Would 110% recommend. All of the detail in the tools built into this app is so meaningful, and it genuinely helps me a lot through different areas of life. And of course there are paid things, but it's not built into a huge paywall. If I had money I totally would pay for premium. Devs, you guys are wonderful !!",5.0
Stephan KotzÃ©,Functional,"Well from the get go when I first heard of the app I was quite interested, thought the entire philosophy behind it was quite clever (especially for those of us who grew up with tamagotchi's). And installing & using it has been nothing but a pleasant surprise. The Devs really care, as is clear in their near flawless execution of the idea. Really helps!",5.0
Uri J.L,Functional,"A super cute tamagotchi x self care mashup. I've tried a few habit apps, have definitely tried to be more mindful in my self care and anything cute has my attention! With all of these things it's a very engaging and thoughtful app that I've sent to everyone I know would love it within a day of using it. Also, support is super responsive and helpful, what more could you ask for?! I look forward to it helping me in the long run while I enjoy my time with my lil pet Snuffles. ðŸ’–",5.0
Megan Bea,Functional,"As a mother of two boys under 3, this app is helps so f***ing much! I have such a hard time getting things done, but ever since I've started using this app (for about 5 months now), things have been going so much smoother task and mental wise. HUGE THANK YOU to the Finch team! Thanks for all the help guys... you have no idea how much you've been helping. Best app ever!",5.0
SunShyne Chen,Functional,"I enjoy this app very much. A lot of thought came with each destination and I love hatching eggs. I love that my Finch has flown to so many places, that he has completed every location possible. I am hoping for an update for new places to fly too. Being Taiwanese, I loved how my culture had been incorporated. Also, game itself can be very lagging and takes awhile to check off an activity or add daily activities.",5.0
Taylor Stripling,Functional,i have severe anxiety and depression and I often get into a bad routine where I won't do basic things to take care of myself and finch has made it a little easier to do basic things for myself I've only had it a few of days but I slowly feel a routine starting to grow and it makes me feel a little bit relieved knowing that I can have something like this on my phone qnd I can see my little finch grow with me.,5.0
molly woods,Functional,"this is my favourite app pretty much of all time. it was so helpful and you can do so much, even without plus. it makes self-care fun and helped me build routine. I love dressing up my bird in little outfits and decorating their room. I definitely recommend to anyone even slightly interested it's just so good",5.0
Alex Farkas,Functional,"EDIT: Guys, the stretches/yoga don't seem to work right now. I have morning stretches set as a daily goal and that works, thankfully, but the other ones just refuse to load the video. I would effing die for this little birb. I am doing morning stretches!!! To have enough energy to send them exploring!!! I AM REFLECTING ON MY EMOTIONS!!! This is the best way of motivating myself to do some self-care. Smidge, I would even go to bed at a reasonable time, just to keep you happy. â",5.0
Harley Augustin,Functional,"I rarely leave reviews but this app is amazing. It helps me be motivated and stay organized. Having a mental disorder is tough, honestly, but this makes me happy whenever I see it. Thank you to the team who made this app possible for everyone!",5.0
Jazmin King,Functional,"This is adorable enough and engaging enough that I've actually kept using it for more than a week which is a huge deal. I do have a feature request. I wish there was a daily or weekly review of tasks or goals that you didn't complete. I'm thinking it would ask questions like why didn't you complete this?, was the task of reasonable?, doesn't need to be broken down further?, why did you want to do the task in the first place? W/ Common suggestions to stop achieve but in a diff way.",5.0
Beth Abbott,Functional,This app is AMAZING! I've tried many times to get into good routines and be active but most of the time I just can't motivate myself and end up lying in bed all day. I've tried writing to-do lists but they've never worked. The theme of this app and the cute animals are great to motivate a young person like me. I literally have this app for like five minutes and I cant stop this smile on my face. I just feel so happy and relaxed!,5.0
Lorena Merrill,Functional,"Finch is a really cute app and good for self care. It's fun to dress up your finch and watch them grow throughout their adventures and gaining new likes and dislikes. It's an easy way to set tasks for yourself in a cute way. I would definitely recommend this app, it is a really good app. Get it and you'll see why it's amazing.",5.0
Jennifer Emdy,Functional,"This app takes no time but has very gentle reminders on self care. I am only on day 2. I have been a wreck since my cat died back in February. She was part of my family for 14 yrs. This Halloween would have been 15 yrs. I became very depressed. I am finally getting back into the groove of things but have felt overwhelmed with both school and work. The daily reminders helped balance my load throughout the week, and I have less stress with due dates. No stress or worry because ""it's all done.""",5.0
Nicole Dunlop,Functional,"I 100% recommend this app to anyone who is only motivated when it comes to taking care of others. I've been using Finch for about 2 years now and it's been a great way to show me what I have accomplished on the days I feel like I've done nothing. Out of all the self-care apps I've tried, I've stuck to this one the best. Also being able to decorate your finch's house and dress them is super fun.",5.0
Orion Andromeda,Functional,"I really enjoy this app, it balances fun, motivation, reflection, and self care very well. I don't feel pressured to get premium, and I haven't had issues with getting enough in game currency to get items I want. I adore my little finch, and she's helped me with several rough days.",5.0
Madison Rousseau,Functional,This is the only selfcare/task app that I've been able to consistently use. It's been about 2 1/2 months and I'm still going strong. Well worth it. Keeps everything (for the most part) free and if you are really hurtin' to get the plus membership there's a raffle you can be part of that's paid by the donations of other users! Great app!!,5.0
Heather Gilmore,Functional,"So far I enjoy it. Not sure if it's worth the premium price (I've only had it a week now) but the free features are good. It's encouraging to have a cute little penguin to play with to have you do you goals and reflections, etc. I find some of the ""yoga"" and other movements are terrible but I love the quizzes and mindfulness.",5.0
Princess Shelly,Functional,This app is amazing and helps me navigate through my daily life. The reminders are the best. I have the notifications go to my watch. It's cute when the little finch messages you. The Customer Support is amazing. Highly recommend.,5.0
Brandon,Functional,"Great app so far. Using as a companion for depression and anxiety. Tbh, I thought it was some kiddie app that I first heard about lol, but it's actually pretty cool. Cute little pet to see grow and tend to via custom goals and journeys. The best part about this app is the guardian program. I currently can't afford the plus version (just yet), so it's great to see a program set up to sponsor others to help have access to the plus version.",5.0
Keira Lear,Functional,"It is perfect. it took a little to get it into a habit, but after it is amazing. it works like a charm. I'm doing everything I needed too but couldn't because I never had the mental stability to get to do it, but after this it is so easy to do simple task. I highly recommend Finch.",5.0
Shonna,Functional,The Finch app has really helped me! On stressful days it's so good to just look at Finch and remember the basic things that help me feel good and keep my life from spiraling into chaos. I love the clothes and decor. It's really fun and motivates me.,5.0
Aly Cavalier,Functional,"I love this app, I use it everyday and got my mom and best friend on board too. It's a great mix between to-do list and personal check-in. I do wish that, instead of new themes and such every month, we got new locations to visit. At the very least, maybe switch off between themes and locations. I've been using Finch for almost 2 years and I've ""been"" everywhere.",5.0
Maria Negrea,Functional,"Really good app! Great for anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or other issues and is great for setting goals, and has more self care which if I mentioned the review would be too long! Lovely even if you just want to plan your time well or have a cute slefcare pet!",5.0
Melat Ezineh,Functional,"I love my little finch (Baby)! When it's a bit harder to take care of myself, having this little guy to take care of helps motivate me to get out of bed and be a person. Plus the tasks are customizable and it's fairly easy to gain gems for cute little outfits so I don't feel that stress or frustration I get from other apps. I also really like the resources they provide to help calm your mind. The urban rain sound is one of my favorites.",5.0
Michael Shonty,Functional,"I've been using Finch for a couple months now. When things are going well in life I barely notice it, but in the harder times it has helped me mitigate the desire to just not take care of myself. I definitely appreciate this app and felt a subscription was worth the cost.",5.0
Elissa Gilmore,Functional,"Love this app so much! I have severe ADHD, depression, anxiety, and BPD and this app helps me every day with getting goals set and done daily which make me feel better about myself! Wish I could afford the Plus version because it has so much more it can do for me, but right now I don't have the funds for it. ðŸ˜•",5.0
Veronika Stephens,Functional,"This app saved my life. I have been struggling with mental health and physical health issues for as long as I can remember but I discovered Finch and it's community and it just made things infinitely better for me. It's reward based and the more you care for yourself, the more you care for your pet. I call it my self care tamogatchi lol I could not recommend this more highly. I love my little Finch, Rosie almost as much as I love my actual pets lol",5.0
Aisleyn Batt,Functional,"this works a lot! I wish I was kidding! they have genuine quizzes with questions that therapists do ask!! I am able to complete tasks easier, it helps me get up in the morning, and the exercises- omg!! all the people I've talked to who have it says it's working great! clearly this won't work for everyone, but please give this app a try!",5.0
Alliza Andrea Marcelino,Functional,"This is the only app I enjoy writing my journal, tracking my goals, practicing habits, and to do's at same time. But I recommend to have widgets for to do list and kindly update the hotline number based on the user's country. Also i think it's a good thing if finch has a lot of expressions based on the user's mood. When the user is happy or down she'll make worried or cheerful expressions, i think it will be more interactive â˜ºï¸",5.0
Sheena Grueneberg,Functional,Amazing app it helps motivate me to do simple things and I actually look forward to using it. Also I love how you get to interact a lot like you get to respond and you get to watch a cute bird grow up and learn new things and try new things . Lastly I love how you can decorate and dress up your bird and name it. There is so much more to I highly recommend if this is what your looking for hope this helps :DðŸ¥°,5.0
Trees & Art,Functional,"This is the best app ever! When therapy ended, I wanted help with keeping up self care, and this is perfect. It is engaging, nice to look at, cute, very optimistic, and a bit creative, and it reminds you to do all kinds of self-care activities every day with a reward system. It has improved my daily level of happiness and stability a lot. The plus version is worth it, but if you can't afford it, you can apply to get a guardian who subsidizes you. You can also become a guardian yourself.",5.0
Sabrina Henn,Functional,amazing app! I have tried many many self-care apps before and this is the best one BY FAR. I have also convinced many friends to get it and they also love it. Being able to take care of your bird and dress it up all while doing something for your mental health is great. It also helps me feel more productive because it has small tasks like drinking water or getting out of bed so when you check on you see all the little accomplishments and feel grateful for them. 10000/10 recommended app!,5.0
Nikki Siu,Functional,"if you need help gamifying your life and struggle with anxiety because of small tasks, this app is for you. as someone who deals with mood disorders and depression, this app has helped me stay grounded and allows for me to feel a sense of accomplishment. with cute side quests of decorating your space and dressing your character. the first aid breathing exercises and reflection tools help a lot. i find that a lot of these helpful tools are what I also learn in therapy. highly recommend!",5.0
Selena Bean,Functional,"This app is perfect for people who have a hard time getting motivated to complete goals (big or small) through out the day. My husband and I both love it! You grow and bond with your finch the more you work on yourself, your mental health, and your everyday life. It's an adorable and very useful app with NO ADDS!",5.0
V Grace,Functional,"This is actually quite a cute and helpful app. It helps me to focus, when there's just too much going on around me, and it helps me to set goals for each day. I really think, moving forward, that it will help me gain new perspective, and positive growth in my mental and overall physical health.",5.0
Crystal Shinrock,Functional,"I can honestly say this is the best app I've ever downloaded. If you have ADHD it's a game changer. It's helped me start journaling, stretching, meditating, and showing gratitude which I could never stick to before. It's like having a Tomagchi or Giga Pet back in the day, but one that helps you accomplish your goals.",5.0
Katie Sparrow,Functional,Amazing app. I typically don't use the finch app but I did go on the 7 day trail to see what it would be like. I love Finch without it. It greatly support my mental health struggles and helps me improve the way I overcome my problems.,5.0
Lainey P,Functional,Super great app! It sends me reminders for daily goals. This app also gives a daily mood tracker and an emotion first aid kit with lots of different quick questions that help you feel better. You get a cute little pet that grows with you. You can send it on adventures and it can discover things like cherriesðŸ,5.0
Envie Jade,Functional,"This app is so lovely. I never thought I would find something that actually did what it claimed to do as far as mental health and self care. It's super cute and interactive. It kind of reminds me of a Tomagotchi for the soul. The sponsorships are an added level of love. I hope to pay it forward one day. Thank you, Finch friends, for bringing a little more light to my world ðŸ’œ.",5.0
Jessica Brennan,Functional,I think this app is amazing!!!! I love this app because it motivates me to take care of my cute pet whilst taking care of myself!

Strongly recommend to anyone looking for an extra boost in the mornings and throughout the day!!!,5.0
Ina Manning,Functional,"It's a really good app to help you build up a routine and make sure you take care of yourself. With setting up your own daily goals, to giving fun little bonus' when you accomplish them, it's a great way to stay motivated and change your mood. I know I've felt a lot happier with this app helping me",5.0
Cheyenne Ninnette,Functional,"I love this app. It allows me to set smaller goals every day and helps me get through them by making it fun and almost like a game with a cute birdie character that grows with me. It feels so good when a day ends and every goals are off the list. If I was loaded I would sign up for the plus version, but the free version is great too. Thank you for this wonderful app, developers!",5.0
A W,Functional,"Really is a great outlet for me for creativity, self care, to-do list reminders. The check ins and affirmations are subtle but it helps my mindfulness practice tremendously. I hope to be able to gift the app to friends although the amazing thing is that people can buy/donate memberships in the app as the developers essentially create scolholarships for folks who may need help with the membership fee (which I think is quite reasonable given the amount I use it)!",5.0
Christina R,Functional,"Not only does the Finch app provide a rewarding experience that motivates me to keep checking in every day, it helps me be more aware of my emotions and thoughts while effecting change in my daily life. This app makes a difference between me remembering to drink some water or take some deep breaths when I feel bad, and that has a big impact. Finally, the team does an incredible job at equity and trust-building by their app's users through their Finch Guardian program! You rock Finch team! â",5.0
nanushkasoze,Functional,"I really REALLY like this app so far. I'm worried I'm going to get on a roll and it won't be free anymore though. That would set me back. I'm more likely to buy an app if it's not forced. The only thing I wish was included in the free version is changing the icons of your tasks. It's such a small thing, but it would help with motivation! Otherwise I love it and if it stays free I'm going to recommend it to my friends and consider buying it (and thats rare for me so it must be a great app!)",5.0
Megaroo 101,Functional,This app is actually amazing for my ADHD and with my chronic pain. The goals can be as simple or complex and just encourage me to be a bit better every day. It's adorable I love customizing my little bird and I love that the day doesn't reset at midnight. Most apps will reset goals and everything when I'm usually still awake and doing some of them post midnight. Absolutely amazing! My whole family is hooked,5.0
HannahBear9624,Functional,"I love this app! It helps me to keep on top of daily tasks I usually struggle with finding the motivation for, and you get so much even with the free version. I love the concept of taking care of and providing for a little pet bird, while simultaneously caring for your own mental health. Kudos to the development team for making such an incredible app!",5.0
Jemz Lol,Functional,"It's so cute and fun too play!!!! I highly recommend this for tons of different reasons. Even without premium the basic finch out helps me alot. I even invited all my friends and some family to join it, and gave them my code to join my tree town! Now we even go on adventures together. This app is fun and helps me complete my daily goals. GO FINCH! âœŠðŸ˜",5.0
Sarah H (Jofoyo90),Functional,"Edit; I would like to be able to change the bag my finch carries on adventures. That could be something in the shop. Back packs, purses, suitcases. The big red lump doesn't do it for me. It's cute. I like it. I would say, you got the soundscape things. I can definitely hear when it loops so it kind of ruins the ambience. It'd be nicer if I'm listening to this river babbling for 10 minutes where it doesn't like cut out every once in awhile in an obvious loop.",5.0
Ollie,Functional,"This app is genuinely amazing...it's a great way for self care while also having fun...I love going back to see my finch and I love all of the things that the app can do. the quizzes, soundscapes, and much more... overall, I LOVEEE This app!!!",5.0
The Gresswell Family,Functional,"Its a great app for helping you out, taking care of yourself, it helps with mental health and others.

Thank you Finch for helping me out, loads x Byee!!",5.0
Ren W,Functional,"Really cute app, has helped me a lot with getting my daily chores and goals done by being able to make a checklist and being rewarded for completing tasks, even something as simple as taking a deep breath. No consequences if you don't complete something!! I've loved seeing my bird grow and develop a personality, and this app is a nice part of my daily routine.",5.0
Jason L,Functional,"I love the sound effects. This is a really uplifting app. I was gonna contact the developers regarding this, but google fit integration would be useful. I'm more motivated to use any wellbeing app that integrates with Google fit, as I track nearly everything with it, with my smartwatch etc. But this app is great! I feel uplifted when I use it",5.0
Sierra B,Functional,"I've been using this app for months and it really helped me get back on track with goals. I started a new job and got really busy and wasn't sure how to adjust to not being home all the time. I wasn't getting any chores or self care done at all, it was just work. This gave me the push I needed to get back on track, and made it easy to start! Being able to set small goals like drink water and take a shower and then get rewarded for those goals really helped build myself up to bigger tasks again.",5.0
Nicolle Pritchett,Functional,Really love this app! Has surprisingly helped me so much with self care and just overall mental health. I feel more organized and it makes it fun. I love that the little Finch is my pet and then my Finch also can get pets. It's fun and effective.,5.0
H W,Functional,"This app surprised me. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I do. I just started working on self-improvement and I think I found Finch at just the right time. I find it easy and fun. Lots of interesting stuff it tracks and it keeps me accountable to myself. This silly little bird is actually helping me form the good habits I want and it's great! I've never been able to check-in to a ""goal oriented"" app daily before.",5.0
PuppyCat,Functional,"When I got this app I wasnt expecting much, but after using it for a few weeks, I highly recommend getting this app. You take care of a little bird, by settin goals for yourself like brush your teeth, go outside, etc etc. Theres also exercises for you to do like breathing exercises and such, all of which help you grow your little bird friend and help you! it has no ads, there's premium but it doesn't take away a lot and is cheap anyway. If your looking for self-care apps or anything, this is it.",5.0
Taryn Dailey,Functional,it's a fun little app that helps me keep track of my day to day actions. my mind is usually in chaos trying to organize my day to day routine but with finch I can have that extra help with a little buddy I get to dress up and talk to. The anxiety assistant options are also a great help to calm me down during an attack.,5.0
Drey,Functional,"I don't normally give reviews on playstore but this is the cutest app which at the same time has given me a very positive impact on my habits, coping mechanisms, overall qualuty of life, as well as improved relationship because my partner also interact with me in this app. This is seriously the best app, I hope to subscribe soon when I get a job.",5.0
Amethyst Adventure,Functional,"This self care app is the best. It's cute. It keeps me motivated to get moving. It's inclusive. Set personal daily goals, guided deep breathing exercises. There are no ads. You can buy a membership but if you don't it doesn't affect your ability to easily use the app and a lot of things are available for free, so you don't feel like you're missing out. There's an option to donate a membership to a random person or to be entered in to a raffle to get a free membership. A great start to self love.",5.0
Ailbe Carter,Functional,"This app has helped me a lot with anxiety and tons of other things, it is my most used app and if you suffer from anxiety or/and depression ((And many more such as PTSD or MPD)) I suggest to check this app out. I never feel hated or that I'm stupid, caring for my Finch is like caring for a child. I used to go on and off with this app until I decided to use it, and now I use it every day. I'm about to hit my 1 year milestone with my Finch. THANK YOU FINCH TEAM FOR BEING DI AWESOME!!!",5.0
Erica McNally,Functional,"I've been using this app for 267 days! I've never stuck with ANY other self help/self care app for more than a week, let alone a month.

Elise Momany,Functional,"This is an amazing app that has helped me a lot with my anxiety, and over procrastinating. Overall I would highly recommend this app. It also has the cutest design! the little birds, the clothing, and the house decor are all so cute! ðŸ¥¹",5.0
Robin Riddell (Munfurd),Functional,I love this app so much! Actually helps me keep track of little things I forget and helps me feel accomplished. And the little friends are so cute! I wish there was an option to organize your wardrobe and body paints though haha! And this is just a thing that bothers me but I wish all the in-game currency was round numbers (like by 5s or 10s) instead of getting numbers like 57 etc. Lol I know that's weird but it just makes my brain happy when all the numbers look nice ðŸ˜†,5.0
Perry says gay rights,Functional,"This app has helped me so much in managing my life and my time, not to mention how rewarding it is to simply check something off of your list! I love the way everything is formatted, it's super easy to navigate and explore your options within the app. 15/10, if I could give it 10 stars, I would. Thank you Finch staff for everything that you do :)",5.0
Emmalee Bunke,Functional,"I like this app and how it's set up to be cute and fun and does help with goals tasks and more.I also like the other little things like morning stretchs but over time it does become easier to do the the task because you've done it for so long, but I do really like this app",5.0
Nichole Callahan,Functional,"I've only had the app for 3 days now. so far I like it. it seems to be keeping me on track with my mental health. I also have epilepsy so my mood swings and mental health can really swing around. This app questions you and really dips deep. You are in control of your progress, the extra steps you can do to help mentally and gain points for in app use.",5.0
fox_fight adams,Functional,"(My updated one) there is a lovely community that is helping people who have mental health issues and they have even come together to support each other, this app is great for just organizing your thoughts or just it have something to take care of, this app is lovely and has helped me thought-out the start and neering end of my high school years.",5.0

Pvt. Pineapple,Functional,"PLEASE GET THIS APP! My daily habits are more structured, my mood feels overall better, my little pet is cute as heck, and you deserve to be your best self. With help from this app, and a strong will and respect for yourself, you can build the structure you need. Thank Finch team for blessing me and many others with this app, I'm forever grateful. I'll remember this kind, inspiring, and thoughtful action and carry the positivity onward. Love y'all!!!",5.0
Mistey Summer,Functional,"I've tried multiple self-care apps, but this one is by far the best one. I'm on day 47 of constantly using the app. Gaining rainbow stones to buy items for my pet motivates me to complete my goals for the day. There are so many options available in the game as well in terms of items, customizations and exercises. I absolutely adore Finch!",5.0
Air Dutemps,Functional,"This is the type of app that you could rate 0 if you were not using it to it's full potential & blame it on the app instead of plain admitting you weren't willing to invest yourself in it. I really appreciate the Finch vibes, way more options that can possibly fit in any1 schedule even in the free version. The charaters & pets are absolutely lovely. I honestly could go on for hours, you have to try it & stick with it no matter what 'til you familiarized w/ Finch & figured a way to profit from it",5.0
Juli Hoffman,Functional,"Such a cute app and an adorable way to plan my day. Yes, I feel a bit sheepish using this app for reminders while I'm at work, but I love the gentle way it tells me about upcoming tasks. This app allows me to digitally add things to my to do list in a non stressful way. I also enjoy the breathing and reflection exercises. This is the first productivity app that I've ever used that doesn't feel like a productivity app. This is a great way to gameify your day while improving your mental health.",5.0
Kelsey Hunkins,Functional,"I've never been able to hold myself accountable to anything, but this app has helped ""gameify"" healthy habits. I want to get in bed at a decent hour because I want more points to take care of the little buddy. The app does a great job of providing ample content to reward your healthy habits without allowing you to while away time on the app itself.",5.0
Red Panda Studios,Functional,"Hi. I left a review on this app a negative review on this app a year ago and I take back what I say. This is the BEST selfcare app I have ever used, you can easily set goals made by yourself, or premade ones, and make routines. and connect actual exercises and different things to that tasks. there are writing prompts, and so many different things to do around the app. I would recommend to everyone, especially if you struggle with routine and mental health like I do.",5.0
Nora Goodwin,Functional,It's such a fun way to stay in touch with friends. It's guilt free too! Some apps send you messages that try to make you feel bad about not using them. But this one is just all positivity and grounding. The birds are so sweet and inspire moments of joy throughout my day. SO CUTE!!!,5.0
Caylin-Lisa Palmer,Functional,"Really helpful for my mental health. I can track my mood every day, and they keep a record of it and how motivated I am for the day. Their weekly letter lets me track how my depression is affecting me and my life. Helps me remember every day tasks that are important, but mundane. 10/10 would recommend",5.0
Anabel Ramirez,Functional,"This is the cutest and most engaging mental health app I have ever used. I love my little finch and he keeps me motivated to track my thoughts and feelings. There is so much offered on the app for free that makes it very enjoyable and helpful. Definitely considering buying premium though! I have used finch for two years roughly, and I have enjoyed it thoroughly :)",5.0
Silvia B.,Functional,This app is amazing. Its been helping me so much with simple things I wanted to get done (like drinking more water!) and understanding some deep issues I was ignoring. It takes the pressure away from taking small steps towards a goal and it helps with reflecting on the things that matter. Thank you ðŸ’œ,5.0
mamabear,Functional,"Finch is the ONLY support I've found for my mental health that doesn't make me feel like I'm experiencing 'toxic positivity' or being 'gaslighted' The app is extremely gentle & understanding, especially for Anxiety/depressive disorders, PTSD/CPTSD & affective disorder, etc. I highly recommend checking this one out, it's really adorable. What I wish was included is a functional calendar for tracking cycles & health appointments/meds & the way that mood etc is impacted.",5.0
Alicen Roberts,Functional,"I used this app a while back, and recently started using it again. There have been so many updates and I'm really enjoying using it again! It's much more engaging. I use it every day. It's very helpful to keep track of certain aspects of my mental health and gamifies certain goals which is great for my brain. The developers are very kind, and despite the options to pay for plus, have made it accessible to those of us who cannot afford it. THANK YOU!!",5.0
Lacey Bacon,Functional,This app is so motivating and so wholesome. I've been way more likely to get things done and perform self-care since my friend showed me this app. I absolutely love it and there's so much you can do in it!! Definitely recommend if you need some practice with self-care. The free version is really effective too!,5.0
Alexandra Medley,Functional,If I could rate it 100 stars I WOULD. I can be a lazy person just like everyone else. But getting out of bed in the morning is 100% easier because I look forward to checking off my goals and seeing my progress. I also like the daily check in on how you are feeling. I love to read so the sound scapes are especially a plus for me. Brilliant app I will use probably forever.,5.0
Elizabeth Getz,Functional,"I've been struggling with self-care lately, and while I still have a long way to go this app has helped immensely. The finches are so cute and interactive, with notifications showing up on your phone where they seem to be checking up on you. You also get to decorate their tree house, dress them up, and go on adventures with them while every day, there's a list of tasks for you to complete that takes care of both of you. I'm doing the free, unpaid one, and it still helps. Try it out!",5.0
Katie Moffatt,Functional,"Such a good app for people who struggle with their mental health and self care. Sometimes it's hard to look after yourself, but knowing that completing tasks can help your little pet in the game, makes it easier to do. There is no money required to use the app, there is an in game currency but you cannot pay for it with real money. There is a plus option which is great if you can afford it, but the game is still good without it! I love this app, it has helped me so much",5.0
Charlie Hanes,Functional,"Adorable, Helpful, Funny, and so Charming. I recommend this app for anyone, especially if you're struggling with slef care habits. Unlike other mobile apps, there's a limit on how much real-life money you can spend on the app itself, which I appreciate greatly.",5.0
Scotty Venable,Functional,"One of the best self care apps I've had! one recommendation would be to edit the category of a word when reflecting. I had reflected about how proud I was for being vulnerable (in a healthy way) and the app had assumed that it was a negative reflection when it felt positive that I was being vulnerable! Other than that, an amazing experience!",5.0
Finneas Law,Functional,this app legitimately changed my life. i have never been able to stick to goals before and this finally allows me to. it also helps me stay connected to my friends and has so many valuable resources even on the free version.,5.0
Keagan Carey,Functional,"It's often been really hard for me to keep a consistent schedule, and taking my meds, getting work done and other things that should be habitual, aren't. I've tried apps like habitica, but nothing ever worked, then my partner introduced me to finch. I've been using it for months now and I love it, and it's helped me so much",5.0
Morgan Botha,Functional,I love everything about this. It's really helping my ADHD brain get dopamine from taking care of myself. I called my Finch Potato and I love them. Update: using this app and the guardianship program saved my life. Potato was my something to live for and getting my little outfits everyday and slowly building a new room over the month really kept me going when not much else did. Thank you for making this app. You are doing important work.,5.0
Maeve Duff,Functional,"I've had the app for a week, and it's so lovely and has really increased my productivity and my awareness around my goals and achievements. Really cute, wholesome, inclusive, creative graphics and gender neutral and lgbtqia+ and disability positive ðŸ˜€ I love that my pet Finch can have it's very own micropets and the seasonal events are cute too! ðŸ",5.0
Ellie cross,Functional,"It is a very useful app because it pushes you to do the things you love and make it healthier for you physically and mentally! I use it every day and always make sure to add extra goals. It is calm and positive and helps you spread kindness to others and yourself. It can make you feel so much better about yourself! Overall, a very good and useful app!",5.0
Valerie Hinds,Functional,"This app offers so much and gives an honest chance to pause and reflect. The interactions with your birb are really sweet and thought provoking. Goal setting helps with keeping yourself accountable, and the other activities and quizzes help you to center yourself. I adore all the clothing and furniture items, and the monthly themed surprises are a nice treat and a good incentive for checking in every day. I recommend Finch to anyone who needs a little (or big) check on their mental health. ðŸ–¤",5.0
Jeannie Herrington,Functional,"this a brillant app. it gives you small reachable goals and if you have prem you can costumize it. i love this app when i use it my perspective seems brighter. i wish you could choose other animals. i also like to add hair to mine. i wish yoi can visit other people and maybe make new friendz through app, some people dont have a lot of friends in real life. it could be use to help create a support network voa messages.",5.0
Christina â€œChrisâ€,Functional,"I downloaded out of curiosity because my thoughts initially were, I can just write down my goals/chores etc and cross them off. However, the interactive aspect of having the self care pet/buddy helps keep me focused and motivated. And having the list affect the pet when you cross something off is motivating and it makes me want to stick with it.",5.0
Meaghen Standlee,Functional,I've been using this for a week there's a cool feature that asks you your mood couple times a day after awhile you can see what key words you used to that caused a better mood! love decorating the home and so happy with it a lot is available on the free version which is great bc im on a tight budget! I like how it prompts you questions and it kind of reminds me of my long lost tamagatchie pet ðŸ,5.0
Ritagail Burleson,Functional,"Updated 2023: While I can't afford another year of premium (and I don't really need it), I still use the free version ever day and it really is both useful and a source of cheer. Recently there was a glitch in an update, not only did someone respond personally in an email but the glitch was fixed in a timely manner. You're all doing a Very Good, Helpful, and Cheer-bringing job. Thank you. Bless you.",5.0
Maryellen Brady,Functional,"Love the app. Self care is easy with this little app. It helped me through a stressful event. The glitch everyone is mentioning has been fixed, and the support staff has been super helpful & compassionate. Another security feature, is you need to save your data. This is not kept on a server. No one else sees my journal or self care info. Love loveove the team & the app.",5.0
Little Kaori,Functional,"very cute, comfortable and wholesome little push in the right direction to make better choices and build good habits. the free version is perfectly functional and serviceable, the paid version does get pushed in your face quite a bit though.",5.0
Lily Sandoval,Functional,"It is a great self care app. You pick a bird of your color choice, and get to help the bird learn and grow. The bird grows bigger each day and gains more energy points for every self care task you complete and quizzes or mindful meditation courses you complete. I really enjoy it and with it I've managed to improve my overall mood",5.0
Eric Stewart,Functional,"This app is great. It's a neat tool for planning your day and committing to personal goals. So if you just need a straight up day planner, this app works well. If you want a day planner that encourages you and creates a sense of accountability, then this app is fantastic. The best part about it for me is that it reminds me what tasks I want accomplished for the day. I really like all the customization you get rewarded with for completing tasks, as well. I think anyone could benefit from this app",5.0
Melissa Hollinger,Functional,Just downloaded but on track for once in my life. Also has positive affirmations and offers journaling. These seemingly small features are quite helpful. For those who have trouble Journaling the app. prompts you with subjects to get you started. Definitely give this app. a try!!!,5.0
Izzy Wizzy,Functional,"This app is absolutely awesome!! I've already made an effort to get some really important things done so that my penguin can have more energy throughout the day. I also think the first aid and reflection features are a tremendous ideaâ˜† I just wish you could chat more often and even do more things with your penguin. But otherwise, absolutely perfect ðŸ¥° thank you so much for this brilliant app idea",5.0
Rory Bloom,Functional,"Amazing app! I had to restart my progress sadly, because i didnt make a cross account before my original device stopped working. It is very nice going through all of it again now thay i know hwo to use the app better. It helps so much with motivation, and I love the events that encourages people to atleast do adventures.",5.0
Kaeya,Functional,"I'm loving this app! I've struggled with my mental health since I was a kid, and after a few horrible experiences I've been scared to try ""traditional"" help again. My friends showed Finch to me and it has really been helping me, even if just a little. At the very least I'm consistently eating at least one meal a day, which is way more than I could say before. I'm hoping to get a guardian so I can try the full extent of Finch, as the trial period was helpful Thanks for the amazing app, devs ðŸ’™",5.0
Megan Steele,Functional,"This is awesome and so cute. doing chores is ten times more fun. Unlike other pet apps you don't have to worry about feeding them yet you can still watch them grow. You don't have to give all your information. Still it's like having a little helper. It has helped with my anxiety and aspergers. love this app! They have the most adorable walk. It's addictive, but not in a way that traps you on the screen.",5.0
Sassynerd X,Functional,"A fun, silly little app that keeps me motivated for daily tasks. I hope to someday be able to afford the paid version, but I really am enjoying the free version for now. But I can't access most of my contact list to use with the ""interdimensional good vibes station"", please ask the developer to fix this.",5.0
Deborah Robinette,Functional,I have a history of mental health issues and therapy has been unaffordable so this app has helped me manage those aspects of my mind and disorders. Its adorable art style pulls at the heartstrings and makes it that much easier to indulge in self care and learning to heal. I would definitely recommend people of all ages using this app! Penguins are also my favorite animal so that helps too!,5.0
Edgar Mieth,Functional,"I love it sm, selfcare has never been more fun, and for a lot of things I struggle with, I can motivate myself to do them more often by making it a goal. the finches are adorable, and all the customization in clothes, room and bird looks are really fun. (also plsplspls actually set up the acc thingy, I didn't and then my phone broke and I can't get my babybird back :(( )",5.0
Myrna Marquez,Functional,"Its super cute, it helps track not only your habits but also when you're having a bad moment usually has reflections or insights on the issue and it helps you actually see whats going on beyound feelings. It has ""excercises"" for relaxation and calming crisis. Super recommended, the bird honestly makes taking care of yourself a lot easier",5.0
Alaina,Functional,"Mighty (my pet name) has helped me be a lot more productive, and I love being able to give him the energy to go on an adventure while I'm at school. It's fun ""hearing"" about what he did on the adventure and what questions he has. I love answering all his questions, and it makes my day better! I've had a but more motivation since starting this app and I recommend it.",5.0
Elena N.,Functional,"This app is unbelievable, it's great. The BEST self care app in the store. The free version has all the important things you need in order to feel better, but even the pro version for an year costs the half of the money you would spend for a single therapy session. Get it, it's just amazing.",5.0
Veronica Arnett,Functional,"This is the cutest thing! I love this app! My 4 kids (14 and under), husband and I, have ADHD and love getting our dopamine through helping our baby finches. I wish there was a group or family deal to be able to get the plus but even without it, it's a great app! Teeth brushing, showers, changing clothes, stepping outside, surviving the day and many more tasks are being completed where before, they weren't....AT ALL. Highly recommend ðŸ‘Œ",5.0
River Bailey,Functional,"I downloaded Finch because I kept seeing ads for it, and thought it was cute. But it's so much more than that.This app has helped me tremendously in getting my self care back on track, and even helped me keep track if my ED progress. It's been my motivation through some tough times, and I'm getting better. Thanks to Finch, thanks to my Minty. â™¡",5.0
Shella Kiser,Functional,"honestly this has been the best thing I'm going through one of the hardest times in my.. and that's saying something since I was six trafficked from the very young age. it's amazing how it gives you goals and teaches you coping skills. but because it's an app, you don't have to feel ashamed that you may be certain goals. like I have brush my teeth and take a shower because a lot of abuse happened in bathrooms and shady places.",5.0
Jun Jun,Functional,"Finch does its work perfectly. It contains basics one may need: a mood tracker, reminders, (customizable) planning options. And yes, no ads or donates for anything small and unimportant. However, I personally have a strange lack of FPS. ðŸ˜… No idea why.",5.0
Jasmin Egan,Functional,"When I first got Finch(recommended from a friend) I was like, just another thing I'll have to do everyday. my day is already too busy and tiring. 2 weeks later I could not put it down! this little Finch is in your care to flourish. this app holds you nicely accountable; keeps you on your toes and motivates you to do so! there are mental and physical exercises, lots of journaling prompts to reflect on numerous topics. I've had this for about 4 months and I still can't put it down!",5.0
J. Wic,Functional,"Cute game, definitely helps me to remember the little things I forget to do just because I'm usually always in a hurry with work. When I have free time though, I enjoy taking the moment to check on my little bird friend and tasks I still may need to do, this app definitely gives off positive feelings and I love that it promotes positivity all around. So far, this has quickly become a favorite out of all the apps I have on my phone. Thank you for creating it!",5.0
Loisa Hayward,Functional,"I've not been this motivated to look after myself in a long time! As someone who is starting on a later in life self-discovery journey of neurodivergence, this app is brilliant at reminding me to do the little things that make a big difference to how I'm doing. It would be fabulous if we could have the opportunity to use our rainbow stones to buy gifts for other Finches in our Tree Town instead of just for ourselves+",5.0
Michelle Altman,Functional,its a great app. you do have to pay for plus but if you stay on for enough days in a row then you can earn it. you can take tests on it rated by a fair judgment system and offers a proper helpline if needed. its great if there is something you need to recover from or still are recovering from and its a great way to feel the thrill of taking care of a digital animal without the responsibility. its also a great way to keep track of things and its overall a great app.,5.0
Ian Scheil,Functional,I really love this app! I just wish there were more subcategories and more main categories to sort tags into to further fine tune and track things. It simplifies it a little too much in that regard. More sorting and tracking is better than less.,5.0
Griffin Page,Functional,I've only had this app for a few days but the to do list helps me stay organized and remember to do things like eat and drink and brush my teeth which is very important since I have ADHD and sometimes won't eat or drink for days without realizing. I don't know if I will stick with it but I think even if it ends up not being useful too me it will be useful too many and it is well worth trying. This app also has some mental health questionnaires which helps me keep an eye on my mental health.,5.0
Trevor Hansen (The Social Medium),Functional,"I've been using Finch for jyst over a month, and I can't begin to explain how much it has helped me. I started with simple, basic acts of self-care (depression is a good friend of mine), and soon I was adding more and more tasks, increasing my productivity, and building even better habits. I love checking in, and taking care of little Woobly (my Finch), taking care of him and myself, and watching him grow. The app is packed with great features. Thank you Finch Team!!",5.0
Rawxane la Vegan,Functional,"The best app I've ever downloaded. I tried different apps for healthcare, mental health and psychological support, but it's the only one who actually helped me for real, motivated me to come and check every single day and being proud of every single thing I'm able to achieve. I've had this app for over a year now and I know it's just the beginning of this adventure for me. To everyone struggling with physical or mental health, or just need a cute companion, this is for you. Take care â™¥ï¸",5.0
Megan McNutt,Functional,"Thank you so much for creating this app. It's only been a couple weeks, but I've already noticed a difference in my self care habits. I have tried so many methods, but nothing ever worked. I was always left with shame and guilt. With Finch, I don't feel as bad about myself when my goals fail. Instead my cute birb and I are rewarded when completed. I am motivated, but I don't have to worry about killing my birb if I fail. And the birbs are so loving! I love that I can also add my loved ones!",5.0
Joseph Reinke,Functional,"If you like the app only. Keep on doing you. Whatever you do though, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE BAND. Barely records any of my data, constantly disconnects, heart rate meter is way off, the list goes on. Says it's supposed to reconnect to the phone automatically, have not had that happen once. I have to reset the watch 9/10 times just to get it to reconnect. Currently showing I'm on 10,567 steps for my day, did a refresh for the data and the data on the app shows I'm only at 1,200 steps.",1.0
Tina Keener-Lewis,Functional,"5 more dollars to join a squat challenge? 20 more dollars (and that's at a discount!) for a pelvic floor plan. I was fine with the original purchase, but then seeing every thing I look at was more money, was disheartened. I haven't even used the app and I have already cancelled. I have it for 3 months, but in no way see myself using it beyond that. I was excited about it, too, it sucks. Also, after my new sign up period, was gonna cost over 50 for 3 months... :( get only if you want to spend.",1.0
Christian Armstrong,Functional,"I did the initial offer and was bombarded with ads when i wanted to work out to spend more money when i had already spent money. Then i canceled my account, but they charged me 53 dollars and renewed my subscription. I have emails confirming my cancelation, so I reached out to their customer service. It's been 3 business days, and i have had no response from customer service. The work outs were good and easy. i hate being upsold on more workout. I should not have to pay more after paying",1.0
Sandy Hager,Functional,Took my temporary subscription trial from my banking account when I accidentally hit the wrong button on the app. It skipped my Google Play app payment subscription: I don't understand how that happened. Although it said I was unsubscribed. Apparently it was not soon enough. I can't even find out if they still have me on a monthly/yearly payment schedule that I can't stop. The bank is helping but still. It could hurt my credit.,1.0
Chris H,Functional,I just downloaded this today to add some variation to my workout. Not even halfway through the training video the screen goes white. I restarted it and at the same exact time the video goes white. I know the exercises it asked for so I could complete it without looking up the exercises but that inconvenient to someone new. If this happens over the next 7 days I'm asking for a refund. You shouldn't ask for a subscription fee to only put out a non working product. That's bad business,1.0
Keenah 123abcTL,Functional,"With this new update, the workouts are pointless. They refresh every month to the point where you start with the same full-body conditioning every month. Also, they changed the learning method from clickthrough workouts to video-based. This is inconvenient because while watching the video my phone thinks it's inactive and goes into sleep screen, which means the screen goes black and I have to rewatch the video FROM THE BEGINNING. Definitely thinking about canceling.",1.0
Rae O'Malley,Functional,"So far it works fine. But it would be really great if you could start individual moves within workouts over. Movements are not synchronized in a logical way. IE, standing, than laying down, than standing again with no time for transition given. Edit to add: now one star because after 4 days the app lost my progress in a 28 day challenge and now I have to start over. Very disheartening. I'm still logged in, not an issue of being logged out. Daily reminders are set but do not actually work.",1.0
Maureen Sheahan,Functional,"Do not pay for this app. The exercises are supposed to be specific to your needs but are all very generic. No audio, the exercises are not explained. They switch between standing and laying down at almost every exercise with no time to get up or down or change the mat. Just a timer that counts down silently until the last few seconds, then Ding and a new exercise begins. It doesn't say the exercise names aloud. You have to look at the screen, so you lose several seconds of every exercise.",1.0
Katina Porter,Functional,First impression is not good. There's no verbal instruction and no time to transition between the 30-40 sec. increments. If you have to go from standing to sitting or vice versa by the time you get started it's already several seconds into it. Same issue if you actually have to look to see what you're going to do You only get a chance to do a couple before it's over.,1.0
Kristin Howard,Functional,"Workouts: were not customized at all based on the goals set. They are also just Barre exercises that were modified poorly for a wall which made the workouts less effective and more likely to injure. Horrible experience. Coaching: They didn't offer any support unless I reached out first with a specific question. Most of my questions were about how to customize the app, and I found out I couldn't. I thought coaching was for support and encouragement or extras outside of the app.",1.0
Jason Sykes,Functional,I explained a couple things that could make this more easy to use. For one there is no audio explaining the current exercise and ZERO time between completely different exercises so you could go from a standing exercise to one laying on the ground or leaning against the wall and they would just expect you to be ready with no warning. I told them and their solution was.. well you can always just pause it... yeah because that's the solution wait for the next exercise which is timed and pause it. ðŸ™„,1.0
Emily,Functional,"I started using it for daily routines and enrolled for a discounted trial month that I paid to see how it was. BEWARE that you get charged automatically after the trial period. Typically, all applications provide a courtesy reminder letting you know the trial is ending and you will get charged. They DO NOT DO that. I canceled less than 12 hours after being charged for the upcoming month. They do not offer a refund and even took almost 2 months to reply when I asked about it. Would not recommed!",1.0
Jenay Rhoads,Functional,No audio for somatic exercises. The somatic workouts are nearly impossible to do since there is no audio guidance. In order to do the exercises you first have to memorize what they are doing in order to follow along. I was under the impression when I purchased my subscription that there would be guidance unfortunately there is just a person sitting there doing exercises not saying a word or any guidance. This is a scam to say the least.,1.0
Scott â€œFantmxâ€,Functional,"App does not work. It works briefly on install and then quickly stops. This seems to be a problem with connecting to Google fit. I have updated, installed, checked all permissions and the app just hangs and spins circles. I have other apps for step and calorie tracking and having to manually input these again in yet another app is too much. Essentially the app becomes useless. Also you can't cast workouts to the television like you can with other apps. Don't buy. Refund requested.",1.0
Jillian Poelma,Functional,"The app overall was lacking. The workouts jump straight from one exercise to the next leaving you missing 5-10 sec of an exercise (each one) if you needed to get up from the floor and position yourself to do the next exercise. Just two days shy of completion, I logged in and all my progress was deleted and the program started over. I reached out to have customer service look into it three times. No response whatsoever. There are better apps, with better plans and better customer service.",1.0
Jenny Balske,Functional,"Like many others, I had an app update that went through. I was on Day 19 & once the update happened, I lost all my progress & had to start over! Super annoyed. Also, the update was not helpful. The background voice & timer are all too loud & just too much. Made the app very cheap looking especially the video clarity when on landscape. I canceled my subscription since there is no way to get my progress back & fearful that any future updates will be the same or even worse.",1.0
Trishia L Amato,Functional,"Can't rotate screen so I can see picture of screen better. Exercises don't tell you what to do exactly such as somatic exercises, needs a better food entry, I've seen better food entries. I paid extra for face tone challenge and it directs me to YouTube where I can actually find better work outs and face exercises for free. I'm not impressed with this app at all, I was hoping it would be good as their advertising, I'm starting to think is really just a waste of money paying for this app.",1.0
Aaron Wesley Hannah,Functional,"BetterThem is a more fitting name. That's what you do, better them through your donations to their product. Purchased and was unable to use due to technical issues. Finally worked and the instructions were abysmal. Reached out for a refund and the best they could do was ensure my auto payment was canceled. When you subscribe, you sign over the ability for a refund except under very specific circumstances most won't meet. They don't overtly tell you this which feels shady. Better options.",1.0
Theo Snell,Functional,Really pathetic. There's no way to project it onto the television set to see a bigger screen there's no way to rotate the small screen that I'm working on with my phone to get a bigger image there's no way to move the image up or down to make sure I'm seeing everything properly just pathetic if I could put it on the TV set it would Make it that much easier to see.,1.0
Shamey Girl,Functional,"So far, they don't give instruction to help ensure you're in position. There is ZERO transition time between workouts, and they can't even combine the floor exercises. You have .5 seconds to make it from standing in a quad stretch to on the floor, against the wall, legs up, ready to go, in a position you're not sure is right. Expect a 15 minute work out to take you twice that in pausing to go back n forth. VERY poorly designedðŸ˜ž",1.0
Radienne Slaughter,Functional,"I like the exercises. However, there is NO written or verbal guidance whatsoever! There isn't ANY time to transition from one exercise to the next! It is very disappointing and discouraging. The repetitive attempts to get you to buy things you have declined is irritating. Now, I can't even access the app to cancel!?! Sadly, I will just have to decline payment via my bank.",1.0
Joshua Figueroa,Functional,"Instantly excited about it, instantly uninstalled. Created account, bio/setup process for wellness plan etc. Jumped into a workout and instantly turned off by how rushed it is. Actually had to exit first exercise cause I thought it was an example of upcoming workout but it had already started. Allows 0 time for transition, no warmup stretch option, no pause to drink.. Being well experienced in fitness now recovering from injury, you don't have to be a novice to feel out of place using this app.",1.0
Amber Beatty,Functional,"I loved this app ! Until.... it reset all my progress. Has you pay for challenges, ($19.99) to tell me to imagine im walking down the beach for several of the days instead of instructing me, when everyone can do that for free. I personally felt ripped off, and very disappointed with it. I loved it when it worked, and without the fees for a challenge that is way over priced for what is actually provided. I will no longer recommend this app, and will be canceling my subscription. :(",1.0
Heather Dickey,Functional,"No good! It is hard to follow, confusing. The food journal doesn't accurately track calories, especially frozen meals (lean cuisine, healthy choice) You have to do all of the work reading labels which can be done for free without the app. I only ever got notifications to drink water. Again, I can set an alarm on my phone to go off and remind me to drink water...for free. The refund policy is very specific and impossible to achieve. I wasn't offered a free trial so it cost $20 to try it out. F-",1.0
Valerie Testa,Functional,"I really wanted to love this app, but it has too many glitches for the price. The audio doesn't always sync with the video, and my progress isn't saved. There is no time in between poses to get in position, it goes from wall poses to floor poses chaotically, and jumps right into the next exercise without an explanation first. It opens to a page trying to get me to add on to my purchase which is very annoying, and none of the challenges are free. YouTube and Instagram wall pilates are free.",1.0
Scott Regan,Functional,"The exercises are good, but the flow of the exercises is horrible. Still, that's only if you can get to the exercises at all, as the app will crash three or four times before loading the exercises. Generally, the screen freezes for 10 to 20 seconds and then - BAM! - crash, only to have to repeat the cycle a few more times. I have reinstalled the app twice, and while that fixes the problem for a few days, the result is always the same. The app now also crashes when trying to track water intake.",1.0
Judith Bruton,Functional,"Thought this was going to be a good thing, but there is no ""diabetic"" diet plan. If I were able to get a full list of all the food options available to check likes and dislikes from the onset, then have a menu created from those choices, then it might be better. I'm new to this diabetic thing. There is absolutely nothing out there for structured menus plans! There are suggestions,but I don't eat/won't eat many of the foods listed. I just don't care for them! Too many categories, too confusing.",1.0
Claudia Weber,Functional,"I used to love this app! It was great! It gave much better options, there was a pause option that allowed me to pause between workouts to get in position, it also had breaks between each exercise to prepare yourself, this app went from being a great at home workout tool to a sped up workout app that is too difficult for newbies to keep up with and is discouraging. I will no longer be using this app unless there is changes to the app's setup for newbies vs advanced.",1.0
Connie Gourley,Functional,"There is not enough time to set up between exercises. I know there is a pause button but it is not convenient to have to be going to my phone to pause a workout every 30 seconds. I also there is no sound so I am constantly trying to look at my phone for guidance. Are the workouts supposed to be guided? There is no cast feature that I can tell. I specifically signed up for wall pilates but without sound, longer transition time, and being able to cast, I cannot use this app.",1.0
Ann George,Functional,"I am very discouraged. There is no transition time between exercises, I can't seem to go back to start over, and I really wanted exercise help. The app oversteps with menu advice! Some suggestions are dangerous if you are not in perfect health. I wanted an exercise tips. A daily program. Easy to use. I won't renew and suggest you pass this one by. If a make has a link to the help or how to use the program, please share!",1.0
Serafina Angerdina,Functional,"Good Program but BAD App The Program is pretty good I was talking to a friend that is using it on OS and I mentioned how I thought it was weird that there was no instruction, sound, or transition time and she did not know what I was talking about. Tried it on the website and there is instruction, music, and transition times! So there is something wrong with the android port",1.0
Josean Ortiz,Functional,"There is no time to adjust between exercises or audio reminders of what you whould be doing. By the time you have to switch and look at the phone to know what's supposed to happen, you miss around 6 - 7 seconds. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS!!! Update: The more I use it, the more I hate it. It has some weird stretch movements that you can't figure out fast enough to do them in the limited time you have. Once again, stay clear of this app. I'm sticking with it because I paid for it. However, save your $.",1.0
Matthew Buchanan,Functional,"Terrible/unresponsive customer service. After downloading the app, I was prompted to purchase a subscription with a 30-day money-back guarantee. After purchasing the subscription, I quickly learned it didn't unlock any features, and everything else within the application would cost additional monthly fees. Customer service is unresponsive and has not been responding to any of my messages in one month. They are obviously waiting out the 30-day money-back period before responding.",1.0
J.,Functional,"Kinda useless - doesn't even give you enough time to get into position for the next workout in a set or even the option to add an auto-pause also no option to go back so if you missed something you must completely quit the excersize and start over. Plus, no voice guidance. Most workouts are just a list of various workouts and are not curated towards a specific goal - might as well do it via youtube.",1.0
Kristen Oaks,Functional,"I don't like how there's no explanation about the exercises, they don't tell you how far apart your legs should be or what angle you should lean on the wall. So when the video starts they just jump right into the exercise and you're expected to follow along, by the time I actually get into the correct position the exercise is over. Also, the videos are so small compared to how large the timer is, this app definitely needs work.",1.0
Angelica Premo,Functional,"I've had the app now for over 2 weeks. Week one, the videos had no speaking, music, or transition time. After it was updated, I lost all my progress & had to start over. Week 2, the videos had time to transition, someone explaining the exercises & music. After another update, it brought me back to my old progress with the old videos! Smh, not worth it, better FREE videos on youtube & less gliches!",1.0
LC Barr,Functional,"Frustrating and lacks features that are available on free apps. Slow to load, crashes a lot, and support would just say to uninstall/reinstall the app but that loses all your progress. Meal plan isn't realistic unless you want a lot of grocery waste. The workouts are the best part, but with how prone it is to crashing, I still can't recommend as it makes the plan VERY hard to stick to. Honestly I want a refund but it didn't even work well enough for me to do enough workouts to qualify for one.",1.0
Dar Tsue,Functional,"Not impressed. I just got it. The food portion is a meal plan & recipes which is great. But you have to follow what they show. You can't tweak it to fit your likes and dislikes. The exercises have no pause in between to show you what to do next or to switch sides like an actual class gives. So for an aged couch potato like me, I'm lost and it's frustrating because it is definitely not encouraging. I am disappointed in the workings of this app.",1.0
Judi Buckley,Functional,"I've only done the first workout and will stick with it since I forked over money for it, but so far it's horrible. There's zero transition time and each exercise is in a different position (on back, on feet, etc) so I missed the first few movements on every single exercise. I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing. ðŸ˜”",1.0
Jennifer Schaller,Functional,I downloaded this specifically for the wall pilates and.that section does not work. I keep getting an error and asked to reload but it never does. The app has a short cut button on the bottom screen and a tab in the plan section. Either works. It's literally the only part I was interested in. Update: I didn't get a response to my email to help. But after 2 weeks it suddenly works.,1.0
Amie Liquia,Functional,"I logged into the app this morning and had no choice but to subscribe if I wanted to keep using it. With most apps,when you pay a yearly subscription ,everything in the app is included as a perk to opting into a subscription. Not this app. You pay for the subscription, challenges, meal plans, and so on. The only thing you get is the different choices on workouts. I can get those for free online. This app is not designed with your health in mind. It is designed with the creators pocket in mind.",1.0
Christina,Functional,"I like the timer for the intermediate fasting. It has workout videos, but if you workout at the gym, you can't add your workout on the app. You can keep track of your water intake, but if you forget to add water and want to add from the day after, it won't let you. It'll give you daily meal plans and that cool if you can afford the meals to buy. You also can't sync your watches unless it's a watch to buy just for this app In my opinion, the app is not worth the money.",1.0
tamara harris,Functional,I was looking for the best way to lose weight and eat healthier this app popped up in my Google search with their quiz. I took it and the app features seemed like exactly what I was looking for. I checked out the meal plan and was all set to start this new journey. Day 2 and I logged into my new account to start meal planning and now suddenly the meal plan offered is an additional price? All the courses are also extra. Canceled immediately.,1.0
Liza Gomez,Functional,"I signed up for a one month subscription for the walking plan. Whenever I would open the app, it would note my subscription was canceled. I didn't want to be charged an additional month. They automatically charged the following month and said there are several steps to cancel properly. It was very upsetting as the app was very misleading. I bet they get money from a lot of people this way. DO NOT USE THIS APP!",1.0
Katy Dospoy,Functional,"So upsetting! It keeps not loading workouts especially. My daily workout crashed the app. Deleted it and reloaded and it fixed it. Then the other workouts crashed,now I can't get them to load even after deleting and re-downloading. Keeps prompting for more $ for more options. Why would I pay more when I am already paying for isn't working?! Customer service has been useless and never does anything. Looks like it's time to take my $ elsewhere. Very disappointing after paying for the subscription",1.0
Ernest Fields,Functional,So I thought I would try the app and ended up being the worst thing I've ever dealt with. I wasn't using the app very often didn't really have the time to get into it with work. So I decided to cancel my subscription which they made impossible seemingly. And they keep charging me $30 a month. When they tell you how to deactivate your subscription none of those options work at all. Essentially they collect all your what they call tickets or complaints. Hold them and then email you at there dispos,1.0
Elisa S.,Functional,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Just visit any YouTube for better results and motivating workouts. The videos are boring/unmotivating without any audio - no verbal prompts of the exercise and no motivating music or beats. There is no pause between each exercise in the workout, so I miss 5-7 seconds of each exercise, especially when moving from a standing position to a sitting/floor exercise and when using any type of equipment. Not worth any $$.",1.0
LaRee Leach,Functional,My first workout was not so challenging. You can't move ahead to the next one to see if they get more challenging. So far not impressed. So... just an update to my previous review. Do not purchase!!! The app doesn't work. It worked for a few days and quite working. I could not get any workouts. Then when I tried to cancel my subscription it took me 20 mins of researching how to cancel. Not work the $30.99 a month.,1.0
Shoshannah Ebersole-Raptor,Functional,"Disappointed. So did not offer the ability to change our modify a workout. This does not work for someone that is disabled. I have physical limitations, but the app doesn't my seem to take that into account. Plus you have to pay to use it. I only signed up for the subscription as I was hopeful it would provide options for someone with disabilities. If I did the week trial I would have had to pay a higher monthly rate. Definitely not happy.",1.0
Marissa Neal,Functional,"I purchased a 3 month trial and it's day 1 and I hate this app. I can't figure out how to get my money back so I guess I'm stuck. But the calorie counter options are terrible, can't really choose how to enter my serving size, can't always go by ounces on everything. And it doesn't seem to want to connect to Google fit or Fitbit even though it seems like it could. I don't fast either. Just a waste. My fitness pal is better.",1.0
Jennifer Wehrwein,Functional,"My experience is, this website is, for me, completely un usable. Ridiculously confusing. Haven't used the app at all, they now have payment over 70 dollars and I WANT TO CANCEL, but I cannot figure out how. Insanely difficult to use. Then they expose all your information with your review. I'm not asking for a refund, I just want it cancelled, please.",1.0
Nicole Lloyd,Functional,"I prepaid for a month upfront. Every time I open the app, I'm prompted to purchase upgrades and it's very easy to mistakenly hit it. If you miss a day you haveto start them all over and it won't let you access the next workout (even though you've prepaid for it). I wanted to open another workout and it will only allow you to open the number sequence you are assigned that day. So if you are on day 5 and skip a day, guess what, back to repeating #1 the next day and so forth. Total sham",1.0
Kali Grayling,Functional,I don't like that it jumps from floor exercises to standing back to floor back to standing. Wish it finished all the standing then all the floor so I can get into the positions faster and not have to pause it so often. It also doesn't have any guidance on each move to better target the muscle your working. Deffinetly will go with another app.,1.0
Jody Swestka,Functional,"Love the workouts,keep reading. I was charged multiple times when for different workouts after paying for the app. When this came around on my social media pages, it looked great. Wish I had read the reviews. There is no time to change positions between workouts. There is no communication from the person doing the workout. There is no music involved, so turn on your own. You have to read how to do each pose prior to getting started on a workout, but they do not tell you this ahead of time.",1.0
Rem Lab,Functional,"Disappointed for having to pay this much. Not enough time to switch from 1 position to another. Can't go back, hard to pause. Should group exercises by positions. Doesn't explain exercises. Waste of money but I only did 1 work out so far will give it a couple more to see. But as of right now. I do not recommend it. Much better apps for free Additional, I tried to cancel after not liking the app for 4 days and I keep getting the round around. All I want is this stupid app to be refunded to me",1.0
Colleen Duncan,Functional,"7/7/2023 Updated: The tracking is way off. I selected a 16-minute training, after 30 minutes, it said I was halfway. The timer & voice commands are off. Step count is always off. I did 1.7 miles at 3.2 mph, BetterMe recorded it as 0.15 miles at 1.15mph. Band constantly has to be relinked, which resets day stats. 6/8/2023 The exercises are nice. There is zero time in between each move, so I found myself rushing to the next position. Zero voice direction. Day 1 of Wall Pilates Challenge",1.0
B Heath,Functional,"Don't waste your time or money. There's a TON of free apps that do a much better job. The format of the app is confusing. The challenges are misleading. You more than likely already have an appointment similar installed. Google fit, my fitness pal, you tube. All are a better more cost effective way to achieve the same results. I guess this is why you have to sign up before you can really look at the betterme app by then your suckered into at least a month commitment.",1.0
Jessica Adams,Functional,I hate the updated video where it now talks you through the exercises. I chose this app because it did not have something talking at me. Please get rid of it or add a way to just turn it off and still hear the beeps between for changing exercises. So annoying! Edit I also experienced the progress lost android glitch. Edit: I did contact the team the day I made this review. I received nothing more than an automated response and I've lost my progress in the app again today.,1.0
Alicia Belle,Functional,"Once you start the workout there's no transitions between the exercises. You don't know which moves are coming next. There's no time to get in position to perform the move. The app doesn't explain how to properly position yourself. So if we're going to be doing a move for thirty eight seconds, you wasted the first twenty seconds, getting in position and figuring out what you're doing. And since there's no transitions between the moves could we do all the floor exercises while we're on the floor",1.0
Zoe Johnston,Functional,"Not ideal at all. The ""premium"" programme doesn't include any meal plans, only the option of fasting. This isn't clear until after purchase. The exercise programmes are short and approachable, but the videos have no audio instructions and no gaps to transition between movements. This means you have to be able to see the screen the whole time, which is impossible when doing a mix of standing and floor exercises from a phone screen. Oh, and it froze halfway through. Wouldn't have paid had I known.",1.0
Anastasiya .Fabrichnova,Functional,"The worst user service I've ever encountered in my life! Having initially paid for the account, after 3 days I lost access to the content due to internal confusion in the application. I wrote letters to the service, described the problem and attached screenshots. Not only do they respond within 8-10 days, but their answers are just for advice, see the FAQ. But now my problem is that I can't cancel my subscription. Gives an error message. There are a lot of such services with a much lower price.",1.0
David Moran,Functional,Now not been working longer than it was working for me. First few weeks it worked well and workouts were easy to follow. For the last 4 weeks though it's gives an error saying 'Something went wrong. Please check your internet connection and reload.' Reloading does nothing and I have connectivity. Have reached out to the developer twice through different channels and had nothing but an automated response back. The app still prompts me to purchase another plan though! Stay away. Not worth it.,1.0
Karen Woolley,Functional,"Didn't really like the format of exercises, not set out well at all, no intention of continuing with the plan but my biggest grievance is the subscription scam! No warning emails that trial is coming to an end, just straight in with Â£60 odd quid being taken from my account with the intention of doing the same in another 84 days! No easy solution to cancel either, it is a scam! There should be a SIMPLE option of ""cancel my subscription"". Whoever monitors reviews - CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION!!!!",1.0
Al Aw,Functional,"Just started using this. Disappointed that there is not a more helpful way of guiding people into the new positions at the start of the exercise. The counter was ticking down while I was still trying to get into position and learn what the correct positioning was for the move being described. Also, be aware that the subscription auto renews after the trial and they take a big chunk of money at once. I wrote to explain I had no intention of renewing but they decided to keep my money anyway.",1.0
Robyn Fitzpatrick,Functional,"I had high hopes, but they were dashed. Some of the content is okay, but there is no sound or instruction. You would think an app that has a ""newbie"" level they would actually explain what you are doing and how to get into the positions. The screen also doesn't expand, sonifnuaing on a phone or tablet it's not very big. Also in the somatic section, they wear all black clothing so you cannot see how they are moving at all.",1.0
Marg Cureton,Functional,I signed up for a trial 3 month period. I had trouble getting any audio spaceport of the exercises. I emailed support multiple times about the issue and did not receive a response to any of my concerns. I canceled the automatic renew in app but the subsciption has renewed again. I'm more than frustrated at the lack of customer service. The exercises were ok but without the verbal description it was hard to follow.,1.0
Louise Giammarino,Functional,"Terrible, terrible, terrible app. The descriptive videos don't match the workouts, sequenses are loaded twice and you end up going around in circles without actually doing a complete workout and the support is simply not there. Pricey if they offered a good product, day light robbery for what you actually get. Don't bother with it. I'd give it 0 stars if there was the option.",1.0
Mark Rainford,Functional,"Wow, awful app from a user perspective. The videos are clean enough and it's OK to use but the exercise part and notifications are poor. You don't even get a few seconds between exercises to change pose, which eats into the time for your next exercise and so on and so on, and there's no verbal guidance at all, just a countdown ticker at the end of each exercise. If you try to leave feedback, they make you email it, you can't use the app. I don't think anyone from this business uses the app.",1.0
Tatiana D'Amour,Functional,"FREE TRIAL IS NOT FREE! I subscribed to the free trial thinking I'd have 7 days to try it out. Wasn't the type of app what I was looking for.

Maya KolÃ§ak,Functional,"One exercise is standing and the next one is on the floor, and there is no pause between them to change positions. Halfway through the video until you realize what the next move is. Pausing every time isn't useful either.

Its demotivating when I'm in the midst of a workout and the app lags and buffers, sometimes stops completely. Frozen. It's not the first time. It's very frustrating. Not sure if the app can handle too many accounts or it's being jammed with too many users. It's awful and I don't think I'm going to renew my subscription again. I cannot stress how frustrating it is for a determined person.",1.0

Both are there on the ios version so don't understand why they are not here.",1.0
GonÃ§alo Moreira da Silva,Functional,"I feel scammed. I would advise anyone to avoid this app. The content is mediocre at best. Often ahead of an exercise it would tell I required equipment, such as weights, which didn't actually feature in the exercise. The worst part is that it sets to take renewal payments automatically, which it doesn't make clear at all. Was told by customer services I would have been sent an email about the renewal but there was nothing on my inbox at all (and yes, I checked my Spam folder).",1.0
Wayne Russell,Functional,Lowest possible rating Not a peep out of them until after they charge to remind me that they already took my money. Cancelling is almost impossible to navigate.

Janet Everett,Functional,The videos do not have any helpful instructions. I was really looking forward to great exercises but this had only subtitles with no actual instructions.

Laura Massam,Functional,"Really disappointed. I took the quiz and decided to pay for the trail only to find no practical guidance at all. The food plans are minimal, advising basic lists of ingredients and to 'combine everything' as the recipe instruction. The fasting section is a timer.

A K,Functional,Extremely poor customer support. Many issues with app functionality. Exercise programmes well structured and encourage daily exercise but the app doesn't function properly most of the time and customer support never gets back so you end up wasting money.

It's also disgusting that you need to pay extra to join challenges, $50 a month is crazy expensive for an app already.",1.0

Would not recommend this app, it's not living up to the rants and raves.",1.0
Pamela Janice Yau,Functional,This app is a scam.

Vanessa,Functional,No instruction other than trying to see the move as it's performed on the small phone screen. Sometimes the moves change midway through a set and it's hard to catch the change while giving your own workout enough focus. Zero time to move from one position to the next so it's hard not to miss some of the time devoted to each move. So far the exercises seem pretty typical. Nothing special and they aggressively try to upsell. I'm not planning to renew.,2.0
Joe Mamma,Functional,"Im new to calisthenics apps so am just giving a quick opinion! There really needs to be at least 3-5 seconds in between each exercise to let us move to the next position. Maybe even a small thumbnail of the next exercise to prepare for it. I am having to pause between each exercise to analyze the picture and it's really clunky. Other than that, the app seems cool lol. Thanks for listening!",2.0
Mikey Grabon,Functional,"Just bought the plan with the band. Haven't received yet, but I have been doing the exercise program. I really don't like it, and doing the exercises on my phone makes me want to cancel the service. The desktop version is better as they air a demonstration before the exercise, so you have plenty of time to transition to the new exercise. No video on android. The biggest issue for me is that I can't change exercises for good alternatives. Because I fast the food plan doesn't adjust meal times.",2.0
Kelly Culp,Functional,"The exercises are fine, but for somatic exercise, it's really difficult to focus on breath & body while trying to watch a phone screen to see what movements are being done. There is no verbal guidance, so you have to stop and watch each exercise being performed. The beeping to transition to the next exercise is also annoying and causes me to lose focus. A lot of time is lost. Even though I've paid for a month, I won't continue to use this program. I've wasted 3 days trying to follow along.",2.0
Sophia Ricoarango,Functional,"There is no transition time between exercises and they are poorly planned out. One exercise is standing, then immediately one on the floor, then back to standing, then back to floor. I know you can pause the videos but it's extremely inconvenient, it would be much better to give 5-10 seconds to get into position between stances.",2.0
Ezra Vergara,Functional,"I just started and I am not impressed. There is no music, no voice guidance, nothing to help transition you to the next exercise. It instantly changes to the next exercise without any sort of preparation as to what the next exercise would be. That is definitely frustrating and it automatically starts the timer. By the time I realize what the next exercise is, it's already about halfway done.",2.0
Jacob Beveridge,Functional,"I thought I was going to get instructional exercise videos, but it's just silent videos of someone exercising without giving you any instructions or any time to get into position. It's just straight to the workout with zero prep time. Even drill sergeants tell you to get into position before starting the exercise, but not this app. No audio, and no time in between workouts other than an occasional rest period, so you have to be staring at your phone the entire time.",2.0
Robert Dynamite,Functional,"I noticed that another reviewer mentioned there being no transitions between standing or lying down exercises. They weren't kidding! Of the five lying down exercises, only two were next to each other. The rest were all sandwiched between standing exercises. I downloaded this because I thought it'd be a chill exercise option for all my back problems. So far I've spent more time struggling to switch from lying down to standing up and vice versa than actually doing the exercises.",2.0
Brandy Chenoweth (RCGbyBrandy),Functional,"Honestly, I have never had so many issues with an app. Content seems good, but app is glitchy a few days in the app updated and then I lost all of my progress data. They only make videos available one day at a time, so I only had access to day 1 when I was on day 8. The app did another update this morning and it seems they removed the verbal instructions from the videos, so you don't have time to get into position and miss half the reps. Still no Customer Service help after 3 attempts.",2.0
Flubby â€œæ¡œã,Functional,"You guys seriously need to fix this issue!! My BetterMe band disconnects from my phone occasionally, since I can't keep them in close proximity at work sometimes, and it doesn't reconnect like it says it should! I have to struggle constantly to get it to reconnect, and now it just won't!! I'm severely disappointed. The band is not worth it. FIX THIS!!",2.0
Janet Peterson,Functional,"Limited. Like others, I can't even figure out to cancel. Work outs so so. I was hoping for challenging wall pilates but they are elementary and only allow you to open 1 a day. I am assuming they get harder some time? Recipes very basic, and there are free apps to remind you of water. Now....only if I could figure out how to cancel!!!! The response below is incorrect as this did not show up under subscription in app. They need to show sub status in app and fix this!!!",2.0
Joyce Jacobson,Functional,"Great workouts, and I love the idea of the company/app, but word of advice, the app is so glitchy for Android phones. I did an update 1x, and it lost all my progress and wasn't displaying the ""wall plan"" for me. I uninstalled, then reinstalled it, and started over again. I just got a notification for another app update, so I clicked it, and again, I lost all my progress. The frustrating part is that you can't skip ahead to the day you were on. It only lets you complete 1 day workout at a time.",2.0
Vina Moore,Functional,"Used for 5 days so far, doing the 30 day wall challenge, on the 5th day it said I was back on day one. Frustrating. Also, there is no instruction to help you with form. Exercises change from one to the next quickly with no transition time. It's difficult to find a good place for your phone so that you can see the exercise and know what you are doing. Exercises are fine, it's the app, transition and lack of guidance that are making me not want to continue. Constant upgrade adds annoying!",2.0
Kelly Lane,Functional,"I enjoyed the app the first day I downloaded it. The app really helped me with drinking more water. The act of tracking my water intake helped to hold me accountable. The exersises were good, but there was zero transition time. By the time I figured out what to do, it was nearly time to transition to the next move. The problems arose on the second day. I have zero access to the daily workouts. The app claims that I dont have internet access, but I do. Overall very unsatisfied. Doesn't work.",2.0
Melissa Pikul,Functional,"Asked to rate after finishing the first workout so there's probably a ton in the app I just don't know how to work yet. There is ZERO sound with the workouts except for a countdown buzzer. No voice saying what the next move is, giving tips, or even reminders to breathe. There also should be a 5 to 10 second pause to get into position for the next move. I understand there is a pause button, but I'm not thinking about it while doing the moves.",2.0
Samantha Kress,Functional,"The concept isn't bad at all. The videos are clear and there's a wide variety of things to do with the app. However,there is no transition time between exercises and you can't rewind most workouts so you risk missing a lot. Additionally, 4/5 times when I go to access my daily plan I get an error message. I can access everything else, but my plan is what I'm specifically paying for, so I expect it to work. The bugs and minor inconveniences add up, and I'm disappointed because I wanted to like it.",2.0
Abigayle Thompson,Functional,"Hard to keep up with... They only give you 30 seconds of each exercise, but they're immediately back to back, and usually totally different positions. There's no time in between exercises to get into position before the timer starts, so you're really only doing the exercise for half the time once you figure out and get into the new position. Disappointing",2.0
Rachael G,Functional,"Only 1st day, but for a workout app, it leaves much to be desired. The workout itself was easy but rhere was no transition period between each move nor any warning what the next move would be. Rather than 40 seconds of work on each, i got maybe 25-30. Hard to see how that will build to any visible progress. Still, its the first day. We'll see",2.0
Lyndsay Ayala,Functional,"I am not happy with the way the workout is structured. It jumps from one position to the next, no explanation on how to position yourself which is inconvenient when you have to stop and stare at your phone while you watch the exercise and the time ticks away. Worse when you have to go from standing to laying to standing and there is no transition time allowed. You're not getting your actual full workout.",2.0
Christine Booth,Functional,I am disappointed with the workout setup on this app. There is zero transition time between getting to the floor or off the floor between workouts before it starts the workout and countdown. I wish there was a 10 second transition with a preview of the workout before it started. I miss half the workout just getting into the position and watching what to do. I would also like a repeat exercise option.,2.0
nvaranavage,Functional,"This app has A LOT to offer. There are several ways to pay. You can track your water intake easily and food calories but with a bit more effort, while the app tracks your steps and logs the exercises provided you use the exercise plans in the app. Having to track my water and food calories the way the app is set up is not efficient for me, which is why I discontinued use. Never got ads, but you also really can't use this app for free, for me is a negative and you have to pay for add-ons.",2.0
Sarah Schlosser,Functional,"I really enjoyed this app initially. I had two problems. My progress was wiped out and there is not enough pause between the exercises. Both issues seem to be known issues, experienced by others and unresolved. The cost for the app seems a little high and while I don't mind paying for an app based on these issues I am cancelling my subscription.",2.0
Jami Morgan,Functional,"I started working through my program, got through day 3, then the app wouldn't open. Uninstalled and reinstalled, logged back in and my progress is gone. I have to go back to the beginning. I'm enjoying the workouts, this is just frustrating. Edit: just realized I can only complete one workout a day, so I can't get caught up to finish the program before the subscription updates.",2.0
Dorris,Functional,"Save your money and your motivation and find a YouTube video with an actual person to motivate and teach you the proper positions. This app is an automated voice over with the same music every time. No transition times in the beginning (and no, pausing the app is unrealistic in the middle of a work out). If you don't rate the difficulty or hit save your work out doesn't count and the app ""punishes"" you by starting back over on day 1 but this time without music, voice overs or transition times.",2.0
Julie Stinar,Functional,"The workouts were okay, very low budget, but effective. The rest of the app wasn't useful to me. They want an EXTRAVAGANT amount of money ($40/mo almost) and you can't skip workouts or choose ones you like. Asana Rebel is much more customer friendly and costs 10% of what this one does. Trying to contact their customer service just sends you to unhelpful auto-replies that send you back to the quiz.",2.0
Elle Charles,Functional,"it's not a bad program, BUT, there's no pause between exercises, which means you have to manually pause it, watch a few times in advance, or just not do as many reps BTT you figure out what you need to do next! also, once you terminate the program, you cannot even view the exercises, or program, that you paid for. this is super wack! imagine paying for a digital book, but after you term services for future books, you can no longer finish the one you paid for? yeah, they do this here!",2.0
Olga Astapova,Functional,"This app is not designed to be helpful, only to look sleek. There is no time between exercises within a workout, so by the time I get into a position, I'm half-way into the exercise. There is no voice prompt, so I lose time looking at the screen to figure out what I'm doing. The wall is just a gimmick, it doesn't actually matter. The hard floor with the thin mat over it hurts my knees and spine in certain positions. I just did the first workout and feel that nothing was worked out at all.",2.0
Jessica A Lord,Functional,"Not enough guidance. There are do directions on how to properly perform each exercise. Foot/hand placement, the exercises change so fast that by the time you see what you need to do, youve missed half the set. There also is no back button to restart a exercise from the beginning if this happens.",2.0
Jaymee Ricketts,Functional,"could be a good app, but when doing the workouts with the videos there is no pause between exercises so you are scrambling to catch up and end up missing 5-10 seconds of a 40 sec exercise. If a pause could be added, even just a 5 second window, in order to move into the next exercise, the app would be so much better.",2.0
Becca Gurba,Functional,"It's just day 1 for me but this app doesn't really give any time between excercises to get ready. By the time I know what the next move is an get into position, I hve maybe 15 seconds left until I do a new 1 again. Maybe addin in a 5 or 10 second grace period between each excercise or even a rewind button would make it easier Edit from 3 to 2 stars. It doesn't matter if u say the excercise is hard, it doesn't adjust the next one like it says it will. I'm on day 5 and it just gets harder",2.0
Jeph Christoff,Functional,"Like others have mentioned, the exercises are good but there is no narration so you have to pay attention to what the model is doing - especially if you're new to these exercises. There's no delay between exercises, even tho the model clearly got time, and there's no instruction on what the exercise is or how it is helping you on your goals. Expected better from an exercise app.",2.0
Elizabeth Clay,Functional,"So far, not great. Looking for a good way to stay active. Increase the heart rate, with super low impact on my painful joints. Filled out their questionnaire. Got spammed with add-ons. Started first workout, they jump right in, no warm up. Even though that was an option I picked. Heavy knee pinch/pressure with at least one of the workouts, even though I indicated that was a problem for me. No cool down, even though that was an option that I asked for. Acouple of otherdumb assumptions on my end.",2.0
Erica Hall,Functional,"Exercises are too easy or they cause some sort of pain, like to the knees. There are no pauses between exercises to change positions. It would be nice if the floor exercises were put together and standing exercises were together. The up and down, and changing mat setup is ridiculous. Id rather spend that energy doing the workout! Not really impressed. I am experienced in working out. Was a dancer, gymnast, cheerleader, amateur body builder. I'm almost 50 & just want to stay toned and flexible.",2.0
Jennifer Hoag,Functional,"There's no time between exercises to get into place for it (down on floor, up vs. wall etc) or even learn what next exercise is! So I miss the first 5-7 seconds of each exercise and feel behind & playing catch-up the entire program. Where classical stretch or yoga programs I watch on pbs are relaxing and as good for the mind as the body, this one just stresses me out emotionally because I feel behind &rushing. Not a good way to start the day!",2.0
Kim Kurylo,Functional,"Training videos no longer download. Exercise routines are fine. You'll need to pause between exercises to get in position. There's only instructions for the exercises the screen before you begin. Do not choose poorly when choosing a routine, there's no escape but reset to the beginning. Customer service is only responsive here in reviews. Better service would have gotten more stars",2.0
Taylor Paulson,Functional,The concept is great. The plan seems good. Where I feel it lacks is no explaining of the exercises. I find myself watching at least 5 to 10 seconds of the exercises to see how to do them. Another reason I watch them so long is because I can't cast the video to the TV. So I have to look at my small phone screen. This is not conducive to all the exercises.,2.0
Mo O,Functional,"What is good: Cheap. What is not good: Exercises are fine, but there is no transition time allowed to change mat position or get up from or down to the floor. There are no prompts on form, how close to the wall to be, what muscles to push/pull from. There is no music or pacing beat. I have to manually stop the video at the start of the next exercise 75% of the time to move the mat, get up or down, or study the exercise more closely. Not good. Grade C- Two stars.",2.0
eileen westendorff,Functional,"No verbal cues. Exercises went back and forth between standing to floor back to standing, back to the floor. No time in-between exercises to go from standing to floor and vice versa. A huge pain to pause after every exercise to get up or down. Enjoyed the exercises but not enough to keep the app with the current format.",2.0
karli anne,Functional,"leaves a LOT to be desired. I had the app for all of 5 minutes (paid for a year) when a got a notice that a ""friend"" invited me to join a challenge - for $6.. everything in it is a pop up to try to get you to give them more money. you can't even get the meal plan without - you guessed it - a separate fee.. I've had the app for 2 days and I've already been offered paid challenges, paid meal plans, the option to pay for a fitness watch and clothes. waste of money and very disappointing.",2.0
Fina Garcia,Functional,The desktop version does not sync with the app and my progress was deleted with this last update. The workouts seem good but its hard to change positions as fast as the app transitions from standing to being on the floor when your yoga mat is in a complete different orientation. Audio directions would be helpful since you also need to reposition your phone to see the workout.,2.0
Liara Jane,Functional,"Great potential. The motions are great, however, there's no screencasting and the poses go from standing to floor to standing to floor and I'm forced to carry my phone back n forth and reposition it repeatedly to see what's going on. The plus transition time, makes for a poor experience.",2.0
Colleen Stiokis,Functional,"I think the exercises are effective, but it is hard to follow the workouts. They go from one movement into another with no time to get from standing to the movement that would be on the floor. Plus, it would be nice if there was music and someone talking letting you know the proper breathing while doing the exercises. Hopefully, you'll take these ideas and add them. Because after my one month trial, I'll probably find a different program.",2.0
Kimberly Beth Grentz,Functional,"I came here because, I too, wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing. The non-existent transitions and lack of guidance about how to get into a position, where to put feet and hands, how to breathe, made my first workout yesterday feel frantic and haphazard. The exercise descriptions can be found on the ""Let's Go"" page, however not the warmup moves, so I was still lost even though I preread today.",2.0
Joann McLemore,Functional,"My first workout and what's disappointing is the fact that there's no time to get into position for the next excercise. It jumps right in to the next and you're constantly up and down on the floor. The app lacks key posture and breathing tips, as well as voice to walk you thru the excercises.",2.0
Bryan Barner,Functional,The app is weak. There is no ability to pause or to go back an exercise. There is also no prompt for the next exercise nor any transition time. The workout was not tailored to the information I input. I didn't even break a sweat. No way I will meet my goals if the future workouts are anything like today's. Not a fan but I spent the money and will keep with it. I don't see me staying with this after my initial subscription is up. Hopefully it improves and I will change my mind. Keep your $$.,2.0
Erin O'Quinn,Functional,"It puahes you to use their tools which are not standard, and the ways to interact with the program are not flexible. The video exercises are badly coordinated, so it's hard to start and stop them, when you're trying to change positions between exercises and hold a phone, this you miss time doing the exercises.",2.0
Adreana Langston,Functional,"Would not recommend subscription OR app. I just got a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra this week. So fast processor. I was at home, opened the app and tried to access the Workout library. Where there should be thumbnails, text and images there are just white boxes. Went to 24 Hout Fitness. Logged onto WiFi there. Played a Youtube video without hiccups just to see if WiFi was up to snuff. It was. Reopened app. STILL no actual content I can access in Workout Library tab. Other tabs work fine. Not worth $",2.0
Kristina Venturella,Functional,"You can't look back on past days. That drives me crazy! It's not easy to track meals a lot of bar codes don't work and adding your food manually is hard to know the accuracy. Example zucchini, there's one option that is like thousands of calories and another that is less then 10. If you miss a days wall pilates it won't let you do 2 in one day. So if I have a super busy day the next day I can't do one in the morning and one in the evening!? I paid the $16 and do not feel like it's been worth it.",2.0
Giovanna Rose,Functional,"I asked to do a warm up and cool down, there was not one. The exercises were WAY too easy, my heart rate never elevated. The change in between is terrible. You're on the floor then you're standing and by the time you get into position, the exercise is basically over. There should be some talking after like, ""ok, stand up, ok, lie down"" so you know whats coming next and there's not a third of the time wasted trying to figure out what to do.",2.0
Julian Moore,Functional,"Whatever your goals are, you don't need this plan. Look up diets and training plans. Everything you'll get here can be found on YouTube and other free apps. Don't waste your money. Not a bad app, but fairly expensive for nothing all that special. Additionally, their software isn't very user friendly, it can be a but difficult to navigate.",2.0
Donna Williams,Functional,"The exercises go too quickly to get into position and start on time. Most alternate between floor and wall and I'm too old to be able to do that without assistance. I have to keep stopping/starting and for me it is purely an exercise in frustration. It says I have to go 7 days and document to get my money back. The exercises themselves are fine, even enjoyable for the 15 sec I have left to do them.",2.0
Abi Contreras,Functional,"The app does the bare minimum. I can't even change my water intake goal, I can't see how many days I've achieved my fasting goal, and I can't add things to the previous day. I've tried better apps that are free, so I was expecting better tracker app. Wish you'd be able to sync other smart watches than just their band. It's not worth doing programs through them if the app is subpar. Waste. Of. Money.",2.0
Xiomara Diaz,Functional,"I like the concept and appeal, especially for beginners. But, biggest issue is it does not give any time to get into the next position. It's continuous without notice of or gives time of what the next exercise is. I look through the routine to prepare, but it still does not help during the workout, making it harder when not looking at your screen. I feel like you lose time from the routine, especially having to pause the routine to get into the next position so as not to injure yourself.",2.0
Katarzyna Gujda,Functional,"This app is not for beginners at all. They show videos with exercises very new for me, no single word with explenation how to do the particular exercise. No time to change the position of the body and mat. I have to constantly stop the video to follow the instructor. Exercises are cut and paste one after another, so there is no time for changing the position from vertical to horizontal and vice-versa.",2.0
Lb Mart,Functional,"So far not that impressed. No instructions on what do you, the next exercise immediately jumps into the next without a preview of how to change position or how to get in it. I have to watch, pause, get into position try it, unpause to catch up with the timer or else you lose workout time. Also I paid for the subscription then you have to pay Again for challenges. Yes they have some free workouts but if you're starting out you'll have to continue to pay. At this point I'll use until I get $$worth",2.0
Ms. Lee,Functional,"I paid for 3 months of access. When the app does open and allows me to use it the workouts are good. I've reached out that they do need to place a transition time in there because it is truly inconvenient to rush from position to position, up and down or have to pause and still not know the next position to get into to. The newest issue has been that the app doesn't even load the exercises at all. So my access and money are just being wasted.",2.0
Kari Cantin,Functional,"The probably has some good features, but I was more interested in the workouts. With no voice or indication to get ready for next exercise, I miss parts and feel rushed. I also wish there were some basic instructions, reminders on form. I agree with others on no annoying background music is nice. I definitely won't use the app till they do more with the workouts.",2.0
Sophia Burton,Functional,"Edit: a NEW member of the customer service team reached out and helped me with a refund for the extra $15.99 package I never intended to buy. The team has been great. One extra star for them. BUT that doesn't change my experience with the actual app. The interface is clunky and poorly designed. I had problems with the app not remembering, deleting or refusing to input my water and calories. Workouts didn't have the desired level of structure. WAY too much upselling/ads/extra packages.",2.0
Stephanie Bell (Stephanie B Plans),Functional,"Not great potentially dangerous. This app doesn't transition between moves, nor does it give a clear idea of how to know if you're doing the moves correctly. It seems to be 10 second loops of exercise clips with zero direction. During some of the moves, you can't even tell how close or far the person is to the wall. There isn't a boice guide, which is a huge issue when doing exercises where you're turning away from your phone multiple times. The quality of the videos isn't great. Not worth the $",2.0
Renee Nicholson,Functional,"Not what I purchased. After completing questionnaire, I was provided a calendar with workouts and meal plans for the day. After closing and going back in, it's a different view. The one workout I completed had instructions and previews prior to starting. That access is gone. The workouts in my plan tab have no transitions and no instructions. The calendar plan was very good and I was very excited to get going. I can't seem to find that plan in the app or my emails. Very disappointed",2.0
Janet Mcmillon,Functional,"I was expecting a workout based on the info I gave, that gradually increased as I progressed. I am almost 67 years old and the exercises gave no time in-between to get up of the floor, back down on the floor, etc. No audio description or instructions. Some of the exercises were manageable but others impossible for me. So far very disappointed. Just another work out app for young people.",2.0
Kathy Fetzer,Functional,"The app offers good advise for when you're feeling challenged and want to quit. That said, I quit. I didn't like the meal plan. I know I can add my own items/meals, but their menu is VERY repeatative. The exercises are difficult for beginners, maybe everyone, because there is ZERO time between moves! I probably sweat more from going from the floor to standing than the actual exercise.",2.0
C M,Functional,"I just started this app/program for the wall pilates option. But it disappoints me in a few ways, the first being unable to have time in between positions, the pause option is not enough. I also don't like going from standing to floor back to standing I think the exercises should be set up where all the standing ones are done first and then the floor are done after. Some instructional commentary should be included in the videos as well. I don't think I'll be renewing this app.",2.0
Kellie Rivera,Functional,"Not what was advertised. Still trying figure it out. Sometimes it shows my plan, mostly it doesn't. But it's definitely not the full calendar with planned workouts etc like it showed. The recipes are almost childlike. The workouts are hard to manage, even with the timer chime. Switching between floor and wall over and over seems so silly. Would make much more sense to do all floor together. Will give it a few more days but thinking I want my money back.",2.0
Rose G,Functional,"As someone who loves dancing to lose weight,  I ended up spending money on the premium and an additional ""hip hop"" dance that I thought was videos but wasn't. the UI of this app is cluttered, so I got discouraged very quickly from that and soon canceled my subscription. I forgot I even had this app. The one part I did appreciate was the meal plan, but there's better apps for that. Also, they don't cost you over $50 at the end of it all. I never lost weight using this app.",2.0
Madonna L B,Functional,"While I was initially very enthusiastic about this app, I quickly realized the food tracking option doesn't work well at all. It's unreasonable to think every food item tracked can be entered using only ounces. Also, if you make a mistake with water tracking, you cannot adjust it back down. The app needs to be updated to allow multiple options such as tsp, Tbsp, grams, etc. and it needs to allow you to enter specific amounts rather than a slide bar. For now, I've opted to remove this app.",2.0
Sandra Santizo-Lopez,Functional,"To be honest I didn't really like the app as a whole. The step counter didn't work unless I downloaded another app, lots of the ingredients to the recipes I had a hard time finding, and lots of the food I scanned wasn't in your database. The workouts had no transition period so I can get from standing to the floor or vice versa. And no music... So I have to put another device on for workout music. It should be a choice. They wanted me to update my review. Here it is",2.0
Dolly Garlo,Functional,"Asked for a review just as I was opening and starting to use the app. So far, ok? Except really dislike the calorie tracker being a slider bar - so inaccurate and difficult to use. Just let me type in an amount with a calorie calculator, or just add the calories as a numeric value. The slider bar is awful. Otherwise, I don't know yet, I just got the thing! Why are you asking me for a review not 5 minutes in?",2.0
Kaite Carstens,Functional,"Not what I expected The app does not match the video shown. Another user mentioned having time to switch positions, this would be helpful. If that is s not possible, at least knowing what the next exercise would be or having all floor exercises grouped. It's time consuming to go from the floor to standing and back. It's easy enough to navigate but not what I thought I was paying for.",2.0
jen watson,Functional,"Not worth the $20 trial period fee. Would never pay full price. I only signed up for wall pilates. Exercises are not guided. There are no transition times. Coaching is a Noom rip off. The only thing I like better than the free app with my watch is the water tracker. After several emails back and forth, they refunded my money. Now they email me constantly asking me to change my review. So I've changed it.",2.0
Renae Christianson,Functional,"I immediately regretted my purchase for 3 reasons: 1) The workout is made up of short segments (30 seconds) with no time to reposition between exercises so I was constantly tapping to start and stop The video on my phone. 2) There is no sequence to the workouts just a list of all of the available workouts to choose. 3) Most workouts are around 25 minutes, and if you quit part way through your progress isn't saved. I wish there were more ten minute workouts that could easily fit into a busy day.",2.0
Jessica Ruth Robinson,Functional,The workouts are good but really difficult to complete properly because there's no pause between each exercise so you end up missing some of the time getting into the next position. Would also be helpful to display the name of the next exercise during the current one so you know what's coming next. Also the app crashed halfway through my workout.,2.0
Bruce Sealy,Functional,"Started off great and I really liked the app but when it got close to the trial expiration, it wanted me to renew early, which I didn't want to do yet. Then it started throwing an error when I tried to use it. Fixed a couple of times with a reinstall but then wouldn't work at all. Support said that the only way to fix it was to wipe the acct and start over, which kind of defeats the purpose. Guess I'll keep looking for others.",2.0
Emily Church,Functional,"Meh. Has potential to be a great app. Limited in what you can personalize. I would like to be able to log my gym workouts, but that doesn't look like an option. I subscribed but it didn't change my access to anything - not sure what the point was, maybe ad elimination? Still can't change the workout in 'my plan', or my starting weight. I have emailed about these issues and have yet get a response beyond an automated one. Considering unsubscribing and deleting.",2.0
Laura Gowdy,Functional,"Not thrilled with the experience so far. I don't like that there's not a narrative of the exercises being done, and as many others have said there no time to switch quickly to whatever position is coming next or the ability to go back in the video of you accidentally hit skip. Also, the constant barrage of ads is really annoying.",2.0
Tawnee Garon,Functional,"I really wanted to love this app. I was so optimistic that I bought the 3 month subscription. I have been at it for a few days and followed everything to the T. I am most disappointed in a few features. There are not a settings page. The excerises are silent except for the count down. There is zero instructions, just a mediocre video. There is not a transition time in-between movements,which I now see others have complained about (those reviews didn't show when I was signing up)",2.0
F M,Functional,"While the concept is great, the majority of the recipes are missing information, or missing ingredients that are mentioned in the instructions. Also, doesnt recognize all bar codes. I tried it with fireball, and tried searching for it, no results. I mean thats fine, but I'd still like to keep track of those calories. Also, the fasting option does not show how much time is left, does not show and end time, and does not track the eating window. Its an okay app, but it still has a long way to go",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app has potential. It needs a calorie tracking feature, and a shopping list feature. It has good recipes but I hate having to go through every day and see what I need before running to the store to follow their plan for me. Let me pick a day a week for a list to be compiled for so I can go get my groceries. Also, having options would be nice. Having some flexibility is always good.",2.0
Stacy Butler,Functional,"Better Transition Time Needed- INEFFICIENT I'm okay with no sound, I'm okay with no instruction, but for these very short workouts with repositioning needed, there HAS to be a few seconds of transition between exercises. You spend the first 10-15 seconds just getting into position and get no benefit. I don't want to have to keep reaching over and pausing to go through a workout. Also, there is no rewind feature so you can get all the time in once you're repositioned. Poorly executed app.",2.0
Jessica Angelas,Functional,"I was excited to get this app, however, after downloading and using it I realized it's very un-user friendly. You can't track your water intake without having a pop up for another service come up, you can't easily change your portion sizes while tracking your food, it doesn't track steps, and the list goes on. I did a few of the works outs which seemed decent, however, those alone are not worth the money spent. I will not be continuing after my month is up and 100% don't recommend.",2.0
Carrie Swartz,Functional,"Just signed up and completed mu first and more ""difficult"" workout. The only difficulty was keeping up with the changing positions. There is no speaking whatsoever to describe what you are doing and where to stand, for instance hands on wall at shoulder width etc. A big part of exercise is making sure you are positioned correctly or you could seriously hurt yourself. Luckily I have been working out for many years so most are familiar. But for a new person this would be a joke.",2.0
Deja Hodge,Functional,"I've only done 1 workout so far. The app needs improvement. Transitions between exercises would be great. As well as an explanation of how to do them, which muscles you should engage and how to breath through it. I've also read the first 2 chapters and, as a petite woman who doesn't have any body image issues and just want to be healthier, I don't resonate with the writing. Somethings are helpful like reconizing automatic negative thoughts and reevaluating your core beliefs! But needs more work.",2.0
Demi S.,Functional,Very unhappy. I have never regretted a decision so quickly. I saw the add and it sounded really good but everything comes at an extra price. The meal plan was pretty nice which is why they got 2 stars. But you can't even track your own water consumption without an extra charge. Very disappointed that every time you open the app it automatically starts with a page trying to get you to purchase more packages.,2.0
Josiane Martins,Functional,"This is my first day using this app. I can't say much about it yet, but I agree with the other users. The biggest frustration about this app is that there is no transition time between the exercises. There is no music, instructor talking, or any type of instruction on how to the movement. How about using 10 secs between the movements so the instructor shows how to actually do the exercises. Would be beneficial if we could see the exercises from different angles, too.",2.0
Jennifer Lapinsky,Functional,"I was excited to try this app, but ended up disappointed. I have food allergies to certain things and there was no option to eliminate anything other than nuts, grains, or dairy. The food tracker doesn't allow you to input by anything other than oz. It also doesn't allow you to input recipes and get the nutrition information. The meal plan was way too much for me. No easy lunch options to take to work. I felt like I was just paying for the timer.",2.0
Robin Arthur,Functional,I paid $39.99 for an app to help and guide through intermittent fasting.What I ended up signing up for was not as useful as I had hoped. It wasn't as user friendly as it could be. Pop-ups kept showing up asking for additional money to pay for water reminders and food tracking. I asked for a refund and customer service was quick to hear my concerns and refunded me promptly. Thank you,2.0
Rachael Peden,Functional,"Good concept, but needs work. I like the hydration reminders, nice workout selection with subscription, but the tracking is severely limited. Food defaults to the same portion for every serving size (3.57oz) with no standards for basic items (like an egg) and you can't go back and add things the next day. Can't adjust fasting start time if you forget. Training suggestions pop up super late at night (like, 9pm) with no alternate timing options. Weekly reports don't include all tracked items.",2.0
Laura Bergner Owens,Functional,"Entering food consumption is very difficult. The bar code reader does not work, so I have to weigh all my food and enter it manually. Also, the slider used to enter amounts won't stop on the ounces I need. It would be more user friendly to allow user input. Tracking water is great! The exercises are great! The mindfulness feature is good to have bc I wouldn't think about it otherwise ;)",2.0
Charlotte Lopez,Functional,"Logging food is a nightmare. The data base for scanned in items is very limited. Only allowed to put in ounces and its not the most accurate way with a slide bar. Can't go back and view the previous day. Anything manually entered you can not recall on the ""recent"" list. I recommend using a different app for logging food.All challenges are separate prices so I haven't touched those at all. There are definitely better apps out on the market, both free and paid for. I feel like I've wasted my money",2.0
Sue Gibbons,Functional,"There needs to be time allotted to switch positions. I feel like I'm missing half of the exercises! Also, it would be helpful if the standing exercises were done in succession, and then the floor exercises were also done in succession so that we're not constantly going from standing up to kneeling or laying down , especially since there is zero time allotted to switch positions.",2.0
L Ballard,Functional,"I've had this app for two days, and I'm trying to use it to the full extent to get my money's worth. The part that frustrates me the most is the exercises. As many others have said, there is no transition between exercises, no noise (words or music), and the exercises are so mixed up. You go from doing a wall squat to laying on your back to standing up to sitting down. I'm old, I don't move between those positions quickly, and pausing the workout isn't feasible, so don't tell me to do so!",2.0
Brittany Lyons,Functional,The app was okay while I was using it but when I went to cancel I found it wouldn't let me. Apparently to confirm cancelation they are meant to send an email. I never received one and realized the issue when I was for charged another month. When I contacted support the first time they responded asking for more info but then nothing happened. Ive tried emailing and canceling my subscription multiple times since but I've yet to receive a response and I keep getting charged. What's going on here?,2.0
NICOLA DEAR,Functional,"I persevered for the first month and have really noticed a difference to my muscle tone and general fitness , but I hate the beeping !! And also the lack of time to get into the next position . I've just finished the first month and realised that the subscription renewed automatically and the charge was almost double for the next payment , but when I gave feedback the fee halved .. whilst this is great,I don't trust this app any longer and will endeavour to cancel now .. don't like being scammed",2.0
Natia M,Functional,"I really liked this app in the beginning. The new music is weird, and the not really helpful video prompts that started a week or two ago started to annoy me. Today, the office workouts are gone, and no one is replying. I like those short sessions to take a break and stretch. I really hope I hear back. Update: I did hear back, and I see the office workouts now, but everything is so different. It seems that Friday's update is now a totally different app, and I am not thrilled with it.",2.0
Cindy Waller,Functional,"Thanks for getting back to me about the no prompts and tutorial issue. App is a little easier to use now. What happens every day is I do the somatic workout and then go into the full body workout. The app always freezes and force closes, but doesn't save my workout, so I have to start all over. Also, there is no History button so I can't see my progress from days past. Thought about changing to a 1 star, but you were quick to respond to my first issue, so ...",2.0
Dean K,Functional,"You finish one exercise and it's literally got the timer and video up doing the next exercise. Sorry team, I don't go from cobra pose the child's pose that quickly. The step up high knee raise video only does one side, so I only did one side. Guess I'll catch up on the other side later, the video also gave an incorrect demonstration part way through. So far the interface is good.",2.0
Derek Weatherbee,Functional,"Exercises are rushed. It goes to the next set and starts counting immediately, so you waste time trying to figure out how to said exercise.",2.0
Nurtika Wigunarsih,Functional,"Other things in this app was good. Just so disappointing that there's no audio guide for exercise. No guide and time how to get into position, I'm confused most of the time figure out how to do the move and the time already run. I'm also need a breathing guide. I keep thinking how to breathe in every move. I took a somatic program exercise, and it's hard to be focus and calm my self when I'm ended up doing too much confusion.",2.0
Scott,Functional,"I think it is great and it is helping me eat healthier and workout right, but the connection from the Band to the App is horrible, I lost all of my data because I had to try the last resort to connect. I was reading to cancel my subscription right away. I didn't, but if it happens again I'm DONE.",2.0
Dominic Sanchez,Functional,It's a low quality workout app. Maybe it works if you do the work but I'm sure there's way better stuff out there for comparable prices.,2.0
Bret Thomsen,Functional,I'm seeing different pricing from the App vs. IG. Makes me skeptical...,2.0
World Citizen,Functional,"It's early days, and I don't want to jump the gun just yet. I'll wait a while before I make true assessment and then I'll report back.",2.0
J Henson,Functional,"App is nothing of what I expected. It was a very frustrating way to start my day. As soon as you open the app you are bombarded with suggestive ads to add something else to your already expensive subscription. You click out of one to be bombarded with another. Aggravating! Also, the walking workout is just a timer that timed you walking. I can do that with my phone for free. My suggestion to anyone thinking of getting this app is not to sign up unless a trial period is offered. Good luck!",2.0
Puviyal Sri,Functional,The app is always lagging and didn't provide any way to unsubscribe from it. When I can use it however it has a variety of exercises and good to keep tabs on eating habits and daily water intake,2.0
Jane Miles,Functional,Finding it hard going from floor to standing and only having it on phone is abit hard to follow..not that happy ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜’.,2.0
David Cardy,Functional,Videos aren't great no audio to direct you and there is no option to hit start it just goes without u ready or not,2.0
Camille Yeager,Functional,"App opened to ""buy me"" deals. Exercises are poorly framed video only so much empty space instead of a closer view of the model. No spoken instructions or written ones, so I have no idea how to breath or even do some of the exercises.",2.0
Leeanne Pool,Functional,"I needed more time between each position, especially alternating standarding and floor exercises.",2.0
Brandola's Granola Watson,Functional,Great the few times I was able to log in. To many offer pop ups. If I could login without having to reset my password every week maybe I would join the other offers. I enjoyed the workouts the three times I was able to login in the last two months.,2.0
tracy williams,Functional,Great program with a variety of exercises. The biggest issue is the app. The video constantly freezes during a workout making the workout non beneficial since I have to stop and start the app and it doesn't work.,2.0
Connie Lee,Functional,No sound? It's really odd to not have audio of any kind. No verbal instructions and no choice to have music. I'm canceling.,2.0
Sabine Miller,Functional,"BUYER BEWARE: I didn't only purchase the plan, but also enrolled for the coach. While the plan seemed decent, there was NO access to the coach. And when I canceled stating that there was no way to contact a coach, nobody responded. So, I am giving this a ZERO STARS for the coach and a 3 star for the basic program.",2.0
Abi Contreras,Functional,"The app does the bare minimum. I can't even change my water intake goal, I can't see how many days I've achieved my fasting goal, and I can't add things to the previous day. I've tried better apps that are free, so I was expecting better tracker app. Wish you'd be able to sync other smart watches than just their band. It's not worth doing programs through them if the app is subpar. Waste. Of. Money.",2.0
Anarita Lopes,Functional,the exercise are ok.. but should give explanation on how to position before count starts,2.0
Janell Lee PDX,Functional,Bland. Ai audio doesn't speak eng. Routines are not consistent. Don't FORCE me to update. And somewhere between five and ten per-cent of the time the audio and visuals don't match,2.0
Carol Ziegler,Functional,Why is there no sound or instructions? Kind of hard to do the exercises when you constantly have to watch the screen versus an instructor queuing you,2.0
Ashima Major,Functional,No instructions and no time to change positions. Next exercise starts without a pause. It's no fun when you have to keep looking at your phone while working out. That's a little annoying. Unsubscribing.,2.0
Andrea P. tarot and crystals,Functional,"I honestly was so excited to try this app after seeing all the advertising. But when I joined in I thought it was one time payment for 28 days which I could do whenever I wanted over and over again as V shred, but instead it was subscription. Not only that I could not jumb the days it only allowed me to do one day at the time which was not ok with me as I skipped few days and then try to catch up. Exercise was great but the whole system is not and that is why I'm giving it 2 stars",2.0
Cynthia Rovendro,Functional,"It's not that I think it's bad, you aren't giving broader answers to your test questions, not everyone fits into your ideas of what people eat after stress. Try giving more options",2.0
Al MacDonald,Functional,App worked fine for awhile but then it lost 70% of its functionality. I reinstalled the app but same problem. I have sent several messages to BetterMe but no response or resolution or way to reach a kive agent. I will not renew upon Expiry.,2.0
Chris Nelson,Functional,Useful app and a decent routine and recipes. . But keeps locking me out of the plan that I have paid for. Unlikely to sub for another month with the app the way it is.,2.0
Andrea Ward,Functional,"The confirmation email says to cancel subscription ""online"" via your ""profile"". This app is still working out the kinks. You actually have to do it through the app itself. Also hearing back from the team can take a long time, but when they do get around to replying they are courteous.",2.0
Gisela Perez Walsh,Functional,"I Iike the access to workouts but it would be nice if my training program updated. I completed my plan so now I essentially have to pick a random workout each day. App would be better if once you completed the training plan, it created a new one. Especially if I'm still paying a fee",2.0
Amanda Ventra,Functional,"I want to like this app but the most annoying part is not having a descriptive run through of what you're about to do. The person in the video changes half way through once you think you know the movements. Small gentle voice overs would go a long way. Also the countdown ticker is good but the sound itself is stressful, defeating the purpose.",2.0
Nena T,Functional,ok so far im not that happy about it when i open the app the ad of buying stuf pops up all the time and if i want to keep going it does not let me it says save it for later so far don like it,2.0
Jennifer Sanchez,Functional,Day one was way to easy. Didn't really do anything but stand and breathe. Hopefully it gets more challenging otherwise idk how burning 12 calories is really going to help me lose weight,2.0
Vanessa,Functional,No instruction other than trying to see the move as it's performed on the small phone screen. Sometimes the moves change midway through a set and it's hard to catch the change while giving your own workout enough focus. Zero time to move from one position to the next so it's hard not to miss some of the time devoted to each move. So far the exercises seem pretty typical. Nothing special and they aggressively try to upsell. I'm not planning to renew.,2.0
Emily Devon,Functional,"Do not pay for this. I did, and I it was such a waste of money. There are several apps that have similar exercises for free. Plus, they do a terrible job of making anything specific to your needs.",2.0
Richard Ciesielczuk,Functional,"Was going great, but a month into the 3 months I paid for the ""my plan"" section refuses to load saying ""something has gone wrong"" and to ""check my internet connection"". I can assure you there is nothing wrong with my internet, but having submitted feedback in app and been ignored there is something wrong with the service. A shame considering I was seeing progress that first month.",2.0
Jake Feltenberger,Functional,Your app could really use audio and there's no briefing of the upcoming exercise nor time between exercises to recognize the next set. Though the app full of exercises and other useful elements the user experience is boring.,2.0
Ioana Constantinescu,Functional,"I tried wall pillates, and it was frustrating because between exercises, I needed to change the position of the mat, and the sitting exercises were interlaced with the standing ones, which made it difficult to manage them. Plus, the explanation pauses were too short, and the exercises started before I even managed to get in the required positions. Otherwise, the app is intuitive and easy to use. I sent 2 feedbacks, but there was no response after more than 1 month. I gave up using it.",2.0
Catherine Brown,Functional,"No sound on instructions on workout, only noise is the countdown bleep and no way of checking if sound is turned on. Not good someone brand new to this type of workout, and no simple FOAs to see if this is something I can adjust",2.0
ShiM,Functional,"5 star was my initial rate cause I've really enjoyed the app at first. But when I stumbled upon some problems and wrote to support several times, I haven't received any help or answer within 2 weeks. And for app that you pay pretty good money, you certainly don't expect that. I am starting to doubt whether I want to proceed to use this app.",2.0
Colin Oakley,Functional,"ABSOLUTELY GARBAGE! No count down from the warm up to the fiest exercise or in between exercises. So your very short 20 seconds of kinda doing an exercise is reduced to maybe 15 if you're lucky. Based off the information I input at the beginning during the setup, my program is ridiculously easy for my fitness level. So far not impressed",2.0
Joe Mamma,Functional,"Im new to calisthenics apps so am just giving a quick opinion! There really needs to be at least 3-5 seconds in between each exercise to let us move to the next position. Maybe even a small thumbnail of the next exercise to prepare for it. I am having to pause between each exercise to analyze the picture and it's really clunky. Other than that, the app seems cool lol. Thanks for listening!",2.0
Tanya Jones,Functional,The app kept making me repeat the first day exercises if I skipped any days. This was boring and repetitive. I wanted something fun that didn't feel like I was working out.,2.0
C Kennedy,Functional,"I had presumed for the money I would get a solid app without glitches. Used for 3 days, got annoyed. Uninstalling to stop being bombarded with notifications. Not motivating. Just annoying. Would like a refund please.",2.0
Jenn Bui Nguyen,Functional,"Why is the app and online version different? The app has me doing two workouts but the online only shows lean muscles. The calorie goal and water goal are different. Only calories are tracked. It lets you see the macros but its measured in ounces for each food item you enter but not the total for the day. Also, changing portion sizes are a super pain. Exercises you dont get a preview of whats next so you have to jump into it. And the plan has me going to the gym everyday! Where is rest day???",2.0
Erica Garcia,Functional,Not a fan. There's no verbal instruction so your just really watching them move and hoping you get the form right. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased.,2.0
Norma Adriana Espinosa Reyes,Functional,"I would like to know which part of my body I'm working, and the survey is missing an important part, restrictions. I need more time for switching the exercises. Other thing to add in the survey.",2.0
M M,Functional,"Edit : I canceled my plan but I am still being charged for it which is ridiculous and it's so difficult to be able to reach someone for a refund. It's crazy that you can't stop it. The app is pretty good, I just don't like that the work out videos like font give you any time in between to switch the work out and get into the new position. nor does it allow you to just drag the video back so that when you are in a position you can start again for the full duration of the exercise.",2.0
Heather Kirkpatrick,Functional,"Great potential...needs user friendliness. There are no breaks between exercises and you're constantly up and down up and down with no transition time or demonstration. Even 5 seconds with a prompt to stand immediately after an exercise would be acceptable. There is no way to restart at the beginning of an exercise. Videos do not change to landscape when you turn your phone, which is visually inconvenient. Not a smooth workout, unfortunately. But could be with tweaks.",3.0
April M,Functional,"The program is great. The exercises are moderately difficult, but really make a difference. The biggest problem is the app. It started me over at workout 1 when I was at workout 12. I email but never responded. Tried again, but when you update it, it tries to get you to buy a yearly subscription. And it takes 2 days for that request to go away. In the meantime, you can't even see all of your progress. While, they're trying to upsell you. I've done this twice, and that's more than enough.",3.0
Angelica McDonough,Functional,Review subject to change! (2 week trial period) I am on a journey of self improvement as a 27yo woman. so far I am enjoying the app after a few days. the list format for daily activities is great for me and each task is fairly easy to complete. I'm liking the water and food tracker. I have NEVER counted calories or watched how much I ate but this app makes that easy and fun too since I can scan the barcode of my foods.,3.0
Theo Tate,Functional,"It is OK, but even after I paid, I am still hit with multiple advertisements for more money. As for the workouts, there isn't any time for transitioning from one exercise to the next. Also, you can't pause the workout to catch up, so it is near impossible to do the total amount of time for each exercise. For a plus, I do like the variety of exercises.",3.0
Ann S,Functional,"Just signed up for 4 weeks. I'm not new to exercise, but fairly new to wall pilates. The transition between exercises is too fast. It's been states multiple times in reviews. I had to pause, get in position then start up. Took a few minutes longer, but I was able to keep up this way. Sure hope this gets some attention! I'll let you know at the end of my 4 weeks if it's worth it!",3.0
Kat Kat,Functional,"It's a good tracker app, and I enjoy that it has exercises too. The biggest issue is the exercises go from standing to sitting to standing to sitting every other exercise. It's annoying. Sure, you can pause the video to transition,but I'd rather have a few exercises in a row sitting then a few standing. You also cannot change an exercise or opt to skip to a different one. For example, an exercise calls for walking but it's 110F/43C degrees outside and I can't opt to skip to a different exercise.",3.0
amber,Functional,"The exercises seem to be well balanced. However, I don't like that there is no transition time given between exercises, so you always have to have your device in your hand to pause & play. I haven't used the other features yet. 9/7 update - after updating the app, I lost my progress in the wall pilates plan and it won't let me skip ahead to where I was. Very frustrating.",3.0
Michelle,Functional,"The app is great for general guidance, but there is room for major improvements when it comes to the workouts. If your phone goes to sleep during a walking workout, you have to make sure to keep your screen active if you don't want an extra long walk. There is also zero transition time given during the other exercises. It is very difficult to remove/add a resistance band around your legs with no time provided.",3.0
Keri W.,Functional,"So far, love the workouts. I actually like the silent videos so I can listen to other stuff. I don't really mind not having a short preview of next exercise or a couple second break. I purchased premium access via subscription. I went down to 3 stars due to lack of transparency about what a subscription includes (in-app and online). I was disappointed that after I paid, it immediately tried to upsell me, and I still can't access everything. Would like access to challenges included in price.",3.0
Kimmie Hamilton,Functional,"Honestly, it's only day 1, but I very much dislike how the exercises go immediately from being on the floor to standing and then back again. There's also a bug when trying to pause the app: the timer may continue while the video pauses or the opposite. I broke a little sweat, but I'm typically a heavy sweater, and it's 100+ outside today. Overall, not impressed so far. I'll update my review of I change my mind as the month goes on.",3.0
Angela Abrusci,Functional,I just started using it so I don't have a lot to say yet. But I have noticed 3 things so far that would make the app better. 1. Verbal instruction with the exercises would be helpful to avoid having to look at the phone in between sets. 2. The diets should have done way to customize them for multiple dietary restrictions. 3. The dance lessons could use more detailed instructions. These are also hard to follow while watching on a phone. Overall like it so far though.,3.0
Nicholas Rojas,Functional,UI can be confusing at time. Nothing really stands out about the app in particular. The most annoying thing though is that it tries to control when exactly you do your workout. It regularly forgets I do a workout only to restrict me from moving on the next day. You can get around this dumb design choice by changing the date on your device. Terrible experience on that front.,3.0
Sebastian,Functional,"Decent design, and cool yet repetitive videos. The biggest problem was... I like to workout at my own pace. I hated being limited to one workout per day. There's a lack of customization and intensity. It was worth a shot though. They have some good features for an average person or a beginner, but I'm not average and it doesn't suit me at all.",3.0
Lanette Harris,Functional,"As soon as one exercise ends the next one begins, giving no time to transition. I also couldn't find a pause option. This means many times I have to stop the program and start again and skip through the exercises I already completed so that I could do the next one after I got into position. If I hadn't done this, I would have shortened each exercise.",3.0
Charles Natoli,Functional,"Great exercises for my first day using the app, the only issue is that the transition from exercise to the next exercise happens to quickly and doesn't give me a chance to see what I'm supposed to be doing or time to get into position. This means I'm missing time and have to stop everything to reach up to stop and start the video. If you added a 3-5 second delay, then I could continue right through with the video and without stopping other than the built-in rear periods. VR, Charlie",3.0
Libby Carter,Functional,"Was a decent app to use, but I canceled (or thought I had) the subscription per the directions and was still charged double the initial price. When I got to digging and try and figure out how I was automatically charged per the email. You have to go online to cancel the subscription requested a refund with no hope of that happening. Just be aware you have to go through 3 different instructions to actually get the app canceled.",3.0
Michele Lesher,Functional,I think it's a good premise to kick start a program but not what I thought it was going to be based on the advertisement. Longer workouts than expected and no direction on how to do stretches correctly from the abs challenger I just did. Reminders about breathing correctly are helpful too. I set this for warn up and cool down and didn't get either; jumped right into exercise and the end was just over after last move.,3.0
Emily Jeziorski,Functional,"An accompanying audio track on the workouts would make a huge difference. Also, there is nothing in the workout descriptions that goes into detail about the stress and trauma release that the exercises are supposed to be helping with. (Which is the reason I decided to try it.) Will not be continuing my subscription after my trial.",3.0
Ted Hayes,Functional,"App does not reliably remember past selected foods. Look up contains numerous duplicates making is time consuming to select. Data often isn't refreshed on app tracker each day, meaning it doesn't always start at zero for a new day. Where to record daily weights is in an unintuitive location. You can't edit a water entry if you make a mistake. You can't save custom food entries as a favorite for easy recall/reuse. The workout and motivational content is good. The food plan has no shopping list.",3.0
Katie Mackay (KMack),Functional,"First workout, I'm sweating good, I liked the movements they were different muscle groups and special stretching that I don't usually do The only big issue was switching between standing and to the floor and knees was very quick there's no time to switch so I would put it on pause every time so if they implemented a 3 second in between or something that would be nice so I don't have to keep pressing pause.",3.0
Leah Wilensky,Functional,"Giving it a three right now (just got it) for similar reasons as other reviewers. It wouldn't be difficult AT ALL for them to maybe show how to do the exercise before jumping right in. Also, maybe a pause between exercises. It's impossible to seamlessly move from one exercise to the next in 1 second, especially if you have to change positions. Really seems like easy adjustments to make.",3.0
Carrie Hannon,Functional,"When I enrolled, I told them my age and my exercise level. then the email link had me to my age appropriate. But when I started the workout using the app, It was more advanced and if you don't know what you're doing The directional changes and the level changes are difficult to get set up for the next exercise. it would be nice if all the standing was in one and all the kneeling or floor work was in 1 section. to get up and down not so easy. So we'll see how it goes so.",3.0
K M,Functional,"So far it's just so so. The app doesn't have any music or transition time built in. No time to adjust the mat or get into the correct position. It also doesn't explain the moves before or as you go so I end up wasting about 5 or 10 second watching the video instead of doing the exercise. I like the types of exercise they do so far, but I'll definitely scrap the app after the promotional period.",3.0
Stephanie Jerome,Functional,"I love the exercises and the simplicity. However, there is zero time provided for you to transition to the next exercise, so you lose valuable seconds because you have to see what the model is doing then get into the position which can be from a sitting to standing position. Also, I'm brand new to this, so some guidance on how to position my body to get my booty close to the wall while on my back would be greatly appreciated! I feel terribly awkward getting into some positions!",3.0
Rachael Ross,Functional,"The individual exercises are good, the flow of the workout is horrible. No transition time between exercises so you miss a lot of reps of each one just trying to get in the proper positions for each exercise. They have you standing up, laying, standing up, laying down.... Also there's no coaching on correct form. It's silent. I hope this gets better.",3.0
Cassandra Lee,Functional,"App isn't problematic, but I only use the little daily mobility workouts. They go fast and don't give you time to switch portions and move from wall to floor and back frequently. I have mobility issues and can't change back and forth that much so I pause it a lot. I was charged a foreign transaction fee. In all, it doesn't make since do do these exercises following a tiny phone screen.",3.0
Sarah Morales,Functional,"Thought this app was going to have a virtual character doing the workouts at the beginning, which would have been horrible, but it's a real person doing them. Downside is no transition time to get into the next position. It just goes straight into next workout and by the time you see what your doing and get into position half the workout time is gone already. Also would be nice if they had an instructional part before next workout so you can get into position and also have one time practicing.",3.0
Leigh H,Functional,"The workout was definitely challenging. My big negative points are that there is no instructional time before the timer for each exercise begins, which left me wasting time studying the movement to be sure I was postured correctly. Similarly, there is no transition time between exercises. The model was on her feet one second and the next laying on her stomach doing a complicated movement. All the while the timer is ticking. I don't feel I got the full benefit of the session bc of this.",3.0
Jennifer Colburn,Functional,"App was great until they did an update and it erased what I was doing and made me start over again. I tried contacting the company and they still haven't gotten back with me. Videos are too noisy now and even though I turned off the workout and cool down it still did them anyway. If there was better communication about the updates and faster communication when things go wrong it may be worth it, but for now, not sure the frustrations are worth the cost.",3.0
Stacy Kalutskiy,Functional,"I unfortunately read the app reviews after I signed up. There was clearly no planning or thought put into the actual user with this app. As others have mentioned, you have no time to transition to the next move, no time to get into correct form, etc. This is just waiting for someone to get hurt trying to rush into position. Actual instructors plan out changing position (for instance going into a fold, then a lunge, then continue leg stretches, roll back up and do the other side). This does not",3.0
Jennifer Engel,Functional,"Just started today......hoping they make improvements. The workouts are not explained, There's absolutely zero audio (except when it ticks down that your set is almost over), there is no time to allow for positioning for the next set (which is usually the opposite position of what the last set was in standing or laying/sitting). Sure there's a pause button, but then you lose at least one rep. Some sort of guidance DURING the exercises would be very helpful (up, down......in, out......something)",3.0
See Patterson,Functional,"I Love being able to track meals. I like that it has fasting advice. The app connects to my samsung health to keep up with my steps. I love all of these features. The exercises move to fast and have no talking. I think it would work so much better for me if the instructor would describe the proper form and explain the movements. I miss a lot of precious seconds due to watching her, and then I have to pause it to assume the position required and then do the exercises.",3.0
Jennifer Gebhardt,Functional,"As a 52 yr old woman in menopause and out of shape, I have seen many positive videos about this workout app and was excited to try. I like the workouts, but being older and having to quickly go from standing towards the wall,then back to the wall to laying down, was difficult. Is there a way to group the stand-up workouts and the lay down workouts? I really want this to work, but I can't keep laying down and standing up every 30 seconds.",3.0
Katrina Stratton,Functional,"So far Iike the app. But when doing the exercises, there is not time in between to switch to the next position before it starts. May they should do all of the laying the floor ones at once and then standing, and maybe have the character moving into position along with you so that there is more time. I could not keep up, I had to keep pausing to get to the next position.",3.0
Amanda Shehann,Functional,"I renewed my subscription after they corrected the technical issues. I would suggest, though, that the developers get better at responding to customer emails. It took me giving a poor rating in order to get my issues fixed. The exercises are good though and quite effective. The transition time needs some work, though.",3.0
Rachelle Oliver,Functional,"The idea is great but it's dumb that there is no pause to transition. I did the wall pilates just now and by the time I stand up, look at my phone and get into the next position, 10 seconds of the 40 seconds have already gone by. It doesn't make sense. Maybe if there was a verbal cue the last 5 seconds of the current video of what you're going to do next, or just give a pause with an image of what position you need to get into next. I felt like I was hustling and behind the whole workout.",3.0
Joanna De Jesus,Functional,"The exercises work well for my level of fitness, they're not too hard or too easy. Only downside is getting set up between exercises. The workout goes back and forth from standing to sitting down, and the countdown on the exercise begins before I'm situated against the wall. Overall a good workout, just need to pause often to ready myself.",3.0
Gulnaz Nazarova,Functional,"I am giving 3 stars in advance because it was only 1st day of using it, hopefully I would see some results. The reason I took away 2 ðŸŒŸ is because app doesn't give time between the exercises to switch and adjust your position. For example, one exercise is laying down by the wall, legs up 30 sec and the next one standing up doing something else. By the time I'm switching, I'm loosing 5-6 seconds, but the count down for the next exercise already began..",3.0
Jhomo Dawdu,Functional,"Good so far, will change my rating once some updates are made. kind of annoying that I can't choose which workouts I want to do on the day. Also the lack of an instructional video in order to get form down correctly is a VERY glaring omission, people can very easily injure themselves with some of the exercises if not practicing in the correct form. Also I see in other reviews other people are having issues with the lack of transition time between workouts.",3.0
Laura Chromzack,Functional,"I just started using this app and looking forward to the customized workout plan but right away, my issue is that there's no transition time between movements so I have to pause the video, get into position and restart the video. It would be more user friendly with a 10 second transition between exercises.",3.0
Jessica Ruby,Functional,"TLDR: Great workout, OK app, misleading pricing. I signed up for a 3 month program, thinking it would be a ""3 month program"". Once I finished the month of wall pilates, that was it. There was no continuation of workouts, nor recommendation for the next one. On top of that, anytime I log into the program tab now, i get a constant ""oops, something went wrong"". I feel like I've been misled to paying for a 3 month program that lasted 28 days, and an app that is constantly crashing.",3.0
Shine,Functional,"So far the water intake count and the intermittent fasting timer really help. But I'd really like to see my past days/months/year details and what I've recorded & can look back and see what I've eaten & the changes. Graph doesn't give much detail and sorta defeats the purpose. Also, food intake is only in oz & I don't measure food. Other units of measure would be nice. As others mentioned, workouts don't set aside transition. Pause helps but defeats the purpose of knowing what to do before hand.",3.0
Darleana Smull,Functional,Right now I am giving it a 3 simply bc when the app updated I lost all of my progress and have to start over. Very frustrating! I do really like the new updated videos and will try to regain my focus for the 28 day challenge. If this continues every time the app updates I will definitely be canceling my subscription though.,3.0
Karen Rose,Functional,"Trying wall pilates. I like the workouts, but they don't give any instruction on how to set up each move and they don't give time in between moves to go from one position to the next, so I'm constantly having to grab my tablet or phone to pause in between moves so I can get the benefit of the entire move. I'd give it 5 stars if not for that.",3.0
Annette Wasilik,Functional,Goofy but straight forward for experienced movers. There are absolutely no explanations and it moves quite quickly from one exercise to the next. I am a former professional dancer and instructor and could make this work but I would not recommend this program for inexperienced exercisers or for those who have previous injuries who might need corrections or to modify the exercises in order to safely perform the movements.,3.0
Elaine Cassell,Functional,"Just finished my first workout - the videos are nice but they go from activity to activity VERY fast - I would lose time for some activities because it didn't even give me 1 second to get up off the floor or down onto the floor - I feel like if I could have had the video show me 1 range of motion and then give me 3 seconds to get in place, I could have kept up with the videos and the workouts better. Overall I really liked the different exercises, got my heart rate up.",3.0
Daisy Crispin,Functional,The exercises are great but there is no time to get into position when you need to transition from one exercise to another. Some exercises are in standing position while others are in lying down position so it is important to have time to reposition between exercises before the timer starts the countdown. The timer starts ticking while you are still repositioning and trying to figure out how to perform the given exercise.,3.0
chris happ,Functional,"App has blank areas when you start up the app, like something is missing. When selecting my profile and selecting subscription terms, you always get th error message ""Oops something went wrong."" You can't get past it. So you can't view the terms of your subscription. It's kind of sketchy.",3.0
Stefanie jordan,Functional,"Really needs to have breaks between the exercises; it literally jumps right into the next exercise in a completely different position with zero explanation of what you're doing and no time to get into position and you're already on the ""clock"". I have a decent idea of how to breath when and what to do to protect my joints ..but if you don't this is really not great.",3.0
Angelarenee,Functional,"Great app except for the technical difficulties. It was great for about a week and a half before I started having issues. I had to log out, Uninstall and re install the app just to use some of main features I paid for after 2 weeks of daily use. We'll see how the next couple weeks ago if I resubscribe or not once my sub is up. Update: worked great for the last 3 weeks then today the app won't even open... having to unstall it.",3.0
Bria Fleming,Functional,"Tried this app for something new and interesting, and it is that. But I'd say if you have even a moderate baseline of fitness, you won't find it challenging at all. I started using it as a warm-up or cool-down for other workouts, and won't continue to pay after the trial period is over. Plenty of free apps out there that actually help you break a sweat!",3.0
Ginger Pentinga,Functional,"As far as the actual exercises go they are just right for my needs. However, there is no verbal explanation of each exercise before starting or written info that I noticed as I was skipping through all the extras your promoting. I don't appreciate that the floor exercises are intermingled with the standing exercises. I have limited space a two dogs who look at floor time as play time. It may be there is a flow to the muscle groups, but I will skip all the floor exercises until the end. There nee",3.0
Cindy Townsend,Functional,"I like the workout exercises the problem is there's no sound to help you prep for set up on the exercise form and there is absolutely no time in between each Rotation which means you get no time to change from standing to laying down, etc. I am sure it is designed that way so that you are forced to buy the coaching feature but if you want people to buy in the very least you can do is simply have time in between Each rotation",3.0
Earnest Joe,Functional,"I want to beable to restart the specific exorcise im on. The videos run at a good pace for someone who knows the movements and knows which exorcise is next. But they run too fast for a newbie to get into position. Pause is helpful, but a ""restart exercise"" option vs having to restart the whole workout would be awesome.",3.0
Lindsey Fryatt,Functional,"After being on here for awhile, it stops way too often for a paid app. It either won't load and closes out, or will close out in the middle of my workout. It doesn't save progress either, so I've lost everything I did in the workout and gave to start over. I love the workouts, but super disappointed in the app. I hope they get this fixed asap, because I've been dealing with this issue pretty much the whole time.",3.0
Kelley,Functional,"The exercises in this program are good, but the pacing is awful. There's no warning out time allowance for what exercise is coming next, so I spend 3 seconds of each shift getting into the right position and I miss part of the exercise. Also to see the videos you have to hold your phone or have a tripod. I was expecting demonstration to be still shots so I could have both hands free. Whoever thought this out missed some important aspects of logistics.",3.0
Charee Brogden,Functional,"The variety of workouts is really nice so boredome with your workouts doesn't happen. The recipes are good but not very many of them. The big problem is force closing. Most of the app will load but when you choose trainings from the main menu, it force closes after trying to load for 15-20 seconds. Really inconvenient when your on a time crunch. 3 stars.",3.0
LaDonna von Stoetzel,Functional,"The website videos account for the time it takes to get into positions (for the most part), but the app videos do not. There is no flow, and, often, you're rushing to get in and out of movements with very little time. Edit to add: The wall pilates program on the app does not have vocal instruction. So, if you're trying to follow along, you have to look at your screen. Pausing to get into position is simply not sustainable.",3.0
P Starr,Functional,"I enjoyed the Pilates using the wall exercises. I like how the app helped to pick your level difficulty. However, I very much disliked that there is no translation time in between poses. There is no description of what pose is coming up next or even how to hold your body during the exercise. The exercises go from floor to standing and back up and you're literally scrambling to get out of one and into the next. You can pause the video, but it's half way into to the next exercise when you do.",3.0
Manda Dodd,Functional,"Was expecting some breathing, positioning, and posture guidance for the price. The transitions are a little rough...I feel I shouldn't have to hit the pause button...I feel I shouldn't have my phone in my hand at all (just a little inconvenient when trying to get up, get down, try and figure out when my butt needs to be in comparison to the wall, etc...) I'm gonna need you to do better BetterMe.",3.0
Linda Meinero,Functional,"I love the work outs and in the beginning the interaction with the coach. I hate the app. I constantly have to uninstall and reinstall many times to get to the workouts, most of the time I give up because it takes too long. This happens everywhere home gym etc. I am currently fighting with this app for 30 minutes and my workout window is closing. I won't get a full week from this 28 day challenge and that is upsetting ðŸ˜‘",3.0
Emma Hill,Functional,"I really just got the app to try the wall pilates, and the workout felt good and tired me out. BUT this app really really needs transition times, a pause button, and explanations of the exercises. I lost 10 seconds on each exercise and they're only 40 seconds long, so that was a bummer. The lack of explanations makes it harder to transition quickly because I had to watch the person in the video do the exercise a couple times so I could figure it out.",3.0
Morgan Bush,Functional,"Has a lot of features, but I downloaded and subscribed because I thought it would give me a specific workout program. It does not. It gives you the option of selecting from a bunch of wall exercises. There is also ZERO time between exercises that requiring getting in specific positions, often with changing the direction of the yoga mat. There is also ZERO voice coaching which is difficult.",3.0
horror_fam08,Functional,"This app is pretty good in regards to tracking my water intake, calories, and fasting cycle. On the other hand after using it for two weeks the workout videos stopped loading and the app automatically closes. I also agree with the other users on how the workout videos are setup. It'd be nice if there was a pause option or at least a few seconds inbetween each exercise, there's no time to transition into the next position.",3.0
Anna Newton,Functional,"Overall I like being able to track food, water and exercise, but I feel there should be more flexibility in entering your data. I would like to be able to enter more precise food types and amounts (rather than sliding scale that can only get 'close' with foods that may not be accurate). I would also like to be able to view details & make corrections to previous days (particularly when the app isn't working and you lose an entire day of tracking like I did yesterday).",3.0
Jocelyn Riley,Functional,"PROS: Easy to use and customizable. This is a great app for improving overall wellness, and tracking/creating healthy habits (i.e. practice mindfulness, track water, food and exercise). Recipes and workout videos are included. Customer service is speedy, helpful, and friendly. CONS: Only works on mobile. I personally did not like the dance videos at all. The background music is outdated. The instruction is robotic. Try before you buy! It's hard to get your money back if you skip the free trial.",3.0
Joanna Kimsey,Functional,"It's just like all the reviews say. There's zero transition between movements. And I've had a few with no verbal cues either. So you can't even know when you should check the screen if your heads down. Also found it weird that what was supposed to be a beginner/warm up video, there was a lot of stuff that would injure someone in heels trying this out for the first time.",3.0
Aspin Rasch,Functional,"The kcal counter is difficult to use. It's hard to find what you ate when you try to look it up, and it wants everything by weight. Which can be a challenge if you don't have a kitchen scale or are on the move. I find I have to use a different app, or Google the calories for what I eat and input it manually. But otherwise it's a great app. Super user friendly, and creates really individualized programs.",3.0
Romes,Functional,"there's no pause in between changing positions and by the time you actually get ready to start, you have 10 seconds left to complete 1 one exercise before it starts the next! mind you this is on a mobile phone that i have to switch holding, putting down, tapping to pause, and tapping again to play. if i can easily position myself standing up, laying down as fast as the lady on the screen with a snap of my finger, I'll give it 5 stars! this just warmed up by being upset!",3.0
noelia,Functional,"Good workout app but sometimes it has a few problems, like now, when I enter the app it used to show the fasting thing, workouts, track my water, meals, etc., but now the only thing it shows it's to unlock the ""Betterme Weightloss Journey"" no other option and I can't change it. It has happened before, too. Also, when I'm doing a workout I wish for it to let me have time to change. I have to stop it and then play it so the seconds would not go to waste of me trying to change positions.",3.0
ELIZABETH TAPLEY,Functional,"Today was my first day, exercises were pretty easy, but the video goes from floor exercises to standing to floor to standing. It would be nice if they could make all the floor back to back and then the standing ones back to back. The fluidity of it wasn't smooth for the person trying to follow the video. You can see how the cut and pasted the video pieces together it wasn't all video as one whole video. I'm not giving up yet.",3.0
Danika Washington,Functional,The app is ok. One of the 1st exercises I was unable to do so I modified it myself but it would have been nice if there was a modify button you can press for something similar. I also wish there was more time between parts of the exercise. Like one part required the yoga mat to face one way then the next part it faced different way but no time to adjust so I had to pause which interrupted the overall exercise experience. There should also be voice commands or music to help keep you engaged.,3.0
Richard Lamberty,Functional,I have a scale and can measure all my portions. But it's hard to match the portions to the available amounts for certain things. The videos appear to be silent. A count down would be nice. And a slight pause with an image or setup time for the next exercise would be really nice. I appreciate that you're exercise models are very precise and clear. I personally would like to see models who aren't in perfect shape.,3.0
Theresa Herrera,Functional,*** update 9/12. The customer service for this app has been amazing. They have been very responsive via email and are listening to the issues. I still don't feel it is user friendly but at this point am willing to test is out and give it a proper review later. ****Don't do it... everything is extra once you pay the initial $19.99. The features are lacking and the customer support is unavailable. This product needs a major revamp and more transparency from the beginning.,3.0
Angelica Hernandez,Functional,"Very nice, The application is very good in terms of recipes and exercises, the recipes are very easy and delicious and the exercises are not difficult. I do not give it 5 stars because, at the moment I press done the recipes, the food is not registered, and when I go to register it, I look for it by the name of the recipe in the app and sometimes it appears but sometimes doesn't, I think that if they fix that It would be the perfect app to loose weight.",3.0
Bre Purchase,Functional,"This application has so much potential. Very good variety in workouts, decent user interface, and the pricing isn't horrible. The deal breaker for me, though, is that there are no audio instructions during workouts. I loathe having to continuously look at my phone screen every minute or less, it's so hard to actually focus and get into the workout when you continuously are picking up the phone again to see what comes next.",3.0
yvonne chan,Functional,"This app truly has potential, love that the developer added the music and audio instructions in the wall pilates, would be great if they can do the same in the daily workout video too. Also I cannot find unit oz to g option in the meal plan, it's so inconvenient that I had to look for unit conversion in google and then go back to the app to type the right number.",3.0
Chelsey GE,Functional,"This app is okay. It has potential to be really good, but needs some adjustments. I like the food and water tracking, and fasting clock, but i wish it remembered more of your personal food items and allowed you to customize your goals. However, the real reason that is joined was for the exercises, and although there are tons to choose from they lack. They flip actions but dont give you a chance to change before it's counting dow . it's also boring with dead silence. music would go a long way.",3.0
Family Ogolo,Functional,"I have just finished the first workout and although I am pleased with the exercises, the video uses 1/3 of my screen, which made it really difficult for me to see the exercises, and lack of audio instructions didn't help either. I hope these can be improved. Other than that, it's different than what other apps propose and I get how it can work better, so long as the user can watch in full screen mode and hear audio instructions that better explain the exercises.",3.0
John Stirling,Functional,"Pros, good video tutorials, well designed workouts. Cons, lack of voice coaching, no pause or back button means when my 2 Yr old demands attention my only option is to quit, restart, and skip what I've done. Overall. One in a very busy field which isn't overly distinctive, and could do some things better. Edit, OK, found the pause thanks to the publisher's reply to another review. Someone else's comment about the lack of a 5 second 'changeover' window is well made.",3.0
Flora D'Souza,Functional,"I actually got my money back after i complained about the misleading way the installation process drove to buy add-ons. Thanks for that, appreciated. I still find the workouts hard to follow as there is no in-built break but there is a pause button. It is also possible to check the next day's routine in advance but I'd find a short preview right before that start of each new routine far better. Overall, for me it didnt work mostly because i had no wall surface with privacy.",3.0
Tasmia Hasan,Functional,"It has a good bunch of workouts but would be better if there's small 30sec intervals in between every set as it takes time to adjust to a new position. Instead of pausing after every position and playing again. Would be better to have that 30 sec break timer to set yourself up for the next position, like they have in the lose belly fat app.",3.0
C Kuzmichuk,Functional,"The app will not open. I did not realize I was signing up for a subscription. Paid for what I thought was a meal and workout plan. The issue was fixed. Update 2023 - Tried the app again. Was looking for a walking program. It is okay. I wish you could pick different walking workouts and not be forced to do the one that is pre-decided, or at least choose between some walking options.",3.0
Challedy,Functional,"Good app, the new Update made the app worse. I like the old way of doing workouts better. It being one big video and not seeing what exercises you're going to do up front is confusing. The old layout of having each workout on a different panel was more structured than what the update makes it feel. I do like the pause inbetween EDIT They apparently only changed the video format for a few videos, so it's not too bad. But I also realised that I lost my progress. Wall pilates is back to lesson 1...",3.0
Stephanie Fisher,Functional,"Too fast between transitions of each exercise. By the time I get into a set and look at the exercise on the screen I'm 5 seconds out of 30 or so. Each exercise is 30 seconds. Also, if an exercise is too challenging they could have a button to push for an alternative exercise option.",3.0
Jane Wynne,Functional,"Lost my stats, having to start again! I was enjoying the Wall pilates and I agree with comments that you lose at least 10 secs of each exercise transitioning from floor to standing and back. However, after 7 days and about to start my 8th, there was an update and now put me back at start with no sessions recorded. Bit peeved I've to start again as there is no option to move forward. Frustrating.",3.0
Ivi Olszewska,Functional,"I get bombarded with additional plans every time i open the app. It's too aggressive. Also there is no prep time available between workouts, sometimes it's a standup position sometimes it's lying down, the mat needs to be moved for some excersizes, why dont you introduce 3 to 5 sec prep countdown to allow to change the set up??? The app is simple, almost too simple, and I have seen better, there is no motivators other than badges... I'm on day 3, and suddenly, I lost my progress?! app is buggy",3.0
Majkee,Functional,"So far it is good, I have it for a short time. It could be easier to navigate, but i think i will get used to it. You can even track calories and there is a mealplan with recipes (many different dietary options which is great) but I would like to know how the maximum of calories per day is calculated, seems a bit too low.",3.0
Fiona Hirst,Functional,"Just finished my first day, the exercises were good and I built up a sweat. It froze several times and also, I have severe mobility issues so getting down on the floor and up again between exercises wasted quite a bit of time not to mention very painful. Would be great if once you were on the floor all the floor exercises could be done together? Also there is no instruction about how to stand, legs shoulder width apart, core in etc etc or how to breath correctly.",3.0
Raphael Baecher,Functional,"Well, a list of exercises without context, Motivation or even time to transition is not really what I call a workout. Too bad as otherwise it's quite easy to use and full of nice UX features. I won't be paying that much for something that doesn't bring much added value vs free contents.",3.0
Pacita Natalia Baum,Functional,Great for light workout to keep u moving. But the app is not friendly. No back button only goes on to next exercise. cannot redo anything. And no time for transition from standing to sitting and back. There should be 30 second timer for transition . Silent video is good for me though! i listen to different music not to get bored.,3.0
Sogie,Functional,Great app. but put off by the app constantly trying to ask you to up grade mid use and charge you for extras . Feels like a dodgy salesman . I would prefer it if they came up with different payment bands including all the extras thus providing better transparency in terms of offer and cost! Unfortunately they have lost me as a customer following the trial period due to this.,3.0
Jennifer Pantone,Functional,"I was notified by my bank of an unfamiliar transaction from BetterMe. I did not sign up for a paid subscription and have not been able to locate in my Google play account of any BetterMe trial subscription. I am requesting a refund. I'm not saying it was a fraud charge, but when I'm trying to cancel a free trial and there is nothing showing in my account to cancel, yet I'm still charged, that sounds a little scammy. As far as the actual app itself, it's a 3 star for me. Could be better.",3.0
Gina Kohl,Functional,"I got this app to try the wall pilates. It hasn't yet given me ANY options. Other than some great examples of a calm, stablized, metatative, way of life due to our ""general"" thinking. It's (Better Me app) going in pretty good detail of how we talk to ourselves is how/why we use self talk to sabotage our very own abilities & strengths; subconsciously. The power of thought is incredible. But I'd like to get to the wall pilates- reason I downloaded this! THANKS BETTER BEE Will report back soon",3.0
Phil Hulett,Functional,"The fitness program is good but there are WAY too many upsells. One absolutely necessary update is a 5 second video demonstration of each exercise BEFORE the timer starts. The way it is now, by the time you figure out what to do and start doing it, you've already missed 3 or 4 reps. It's more than annoying.",3.0
Isa Velasco,Functional,"For years I have tried to be commited to living an active life. Like always life in general can be busy. For instance, marriage, kids and work are a lifetime commitment. I decided to take a leap of faith and see what Better Me had to offer. Aside from it being accessible in the comformt of my own home. The app is easy to follow. The exercises keep me motivated and intereseted. I gave it a 3 stars because I'm only on day 13 of 28 days.",3.0
Paul JT Waters,Functional,"I hv given 3 stars because the video downloads take 4EVER 1/2 the time when connected, and the updates disallow use of the app until it is completed - no choice to wait till after the session - and without an internet connection there is no way to use the app, you can't download your favorite workout. This is not for people who live in any area other than highly internet connected. Unless they have the connected corporate leash around your neck, you can't use what you bought.",3.0
Jane Horton,Functional,Would be great if I could put this on my TV using chromecast. The move from one activity to the next is very fast when you don't know what's coming and I'm just looking at a little phone. Might get easier to transition when I have done it a few times.,3.0
M J,Functional,"Great concept but confusing delivery. I purchased two workout plans. The wall pilates and bubble butt. Wall pilates is great. Has workouts for 28 days and checks off everytime a workout is completed. The bubble butt workout has 85 random excercises so I dont get that feeling of completion, and many are not all related to the lower body at all. Also, when I go to my plan online it shows completely different sessions again. I'm confused to what I'm supposed to be doing.",3.0
Andrew Little,Functional,The first days exercises were simple and easy to follow. The process of navigating the downloading of the app was annoying and infuriating. I did not appreciate the ongoing bombardment of additional offers. These served only to undermine the validity of the basic course. I almost gave up. Several times I had to hunt for the 'skip' or 'next' button.,3.0
Parshan Tashakor,Functional,Why is the app so different from the web version? The web version is much more complete and more user friendly. There are even excercises in the the web version that are missing from the app.,3.0
Jennifer Allen,Functional,"Video goes way too fast and hard to get from one position to the other with the following instructions. I will say I like the exercises, though",3.0
Aneesah Parak,Functional,It would help if there are instructions to go with the video. We need to know what we're doing in the exercise and if what we're doing is correct,3.0
Rebecca Lloyd-Jones,Functional,The add ons are way too expensive. You are in competition with free content on the internet. I like the wall pilates but most likely will delete the app once I'm finished. Everything else is too expensive.,3.0
Mariapia A,Functional,"On day 3, I feel like it should be a bit harder. Maybe assess a past history of someone's active level, as muscle is memory, and those that have a past history of extrekly active lifestyle, I feel, they can get into and push a bit harder. I.e I use to workout 6 days a week, and haven't done so in a few years, although I am not heavy, the exercises could potentially be harder per day; other then that good app!",3.0
Nadine Kadzura,Functional,Showed my friend the app si she could also get it. Now I can't do my workout since it's saying one workout a day.,3.0
Charlotte Larcom,Functional,Really good first 28 days then what happens??? Seems to be the same workouts even though i find them easy now? Then saw challenges being more costs? So you pay 30 a month for basic package and have ti add on 9 a month for challenges?? Im leaving . Was a great stsrt but loose customers once in and con them at start saying its 15 a month amd half way through it chamges to 30!,3.0
Libby Carter,Functional,"Was a decent app to use, but I canceled (or thought I had) the subscription per the directions and was still charged double the initial price. When I got to digging and try and figure out how I was automatically charged per the email. You have to go online to cancel the subscription requested a refund with no hope of that happening. Just be aware you have to go through 3 different instructions to actually get the app canceled.",3.0
Phil Hulett,Functional,"The fitness program is good but there are WAY too many upsells. One absolutely necessary update is a 5 second video demonstration of each exercise BEFORE the timer starts. The way it is now, by the time you figure out what to do and start doing it, you've already missed 3 or 4 reps. It's more than annoying.",3.0
Theo Tate,Functional,"It is OK, but even after I paid, I am still hit with multiple advertisements for more money. As for the workouts, there isn't any time for transitioning from one exercise to the next. Also, you can't pause the workout to catch up, so it is near impossible to do the total amount of time for each exercise. For a plus, I do like the variety of exercises.",3.0
M J,Functional,"Great concept but confusing delivery. I purchased two workout plans. The wall pilates and bubble butt. Wall pilates is great.

Ian Thompson-Villeneuve,Functional,Without having a way to cast this to my TV I'm hanging on to my phone while trying to do these exercises. I would give this a higher rating but that is a little ridiculous.,3.0
Attila S.,Functional,"In the application my plan has disappeared, instead I have a workout plan that I did not even setup. On the webpage I still have my plan, so not sure what happened with the application. Is it because of the latest update?",3.0
Jackie Phillips,Functional,"Would be better with audio motivation, explanation on techniques and what I should be feeling in the muscles being exercised.",3.0
Shaleah Newman,Functional,Today was just day one. It was short and sweet. Not to hard. The warm up and cool down were a great addition to the work out. Will keep you guys updated,3.0
Kailah Chineth-Couch,Functional,"The app is free, that's it. I'm limited on funds, so I'm looking for an all free app and was recommended this online. After you take the survey, you have to pay to get your plan.",3.0
Yolanda Lewis,Functional,These issues have nothing to do with my weight. I'm not emotionally eating. I'm a single mom who has children and work and sometimes it's easier to grab what's quick. Don't have a lot of time for self.,3.0
Kevin Patton,Functional,It was more challenging than I anticipated. Still imagine myself being able to do things I used to.,3.0
Donna Parks,Functional,I'm not a sweet eater but I had to answer something on the last question here because I was supposed to I guess.,3.0
catwab,Functional,"After the first day I noticed the exercises run continuously with no pause. There is no time for preparation. In a 20 second exercise, that wastes a lot of time in my opinion.",3.0
Gina Kohl,Functional,"I got this app to try the wall pilates. It hasn't yet given me ANY options. Other than some great examples of a calm, stablized, metatative, way of life due to our ""general"" thinking. It's (Better Me app) going in pretty good detail of how we talk to ourselves is how/why we use self talk to sabotage our very own abilities & strengths; subconsciously. The power of thought is incredible. But I'd like to get to the wall pilates- reason I downloaded this! THANKS BETTER BEE Will report back soon",3.0
sandra payne,Functional,The app is great the only issue that I have is that my steps on the app don't add up to my Samsung watch...it's about a 4000 step difference.,3.0
Evelyn Ellis,Functional,Some music would be good. A countdown time of which workout exercise next would be helpful as it just goes straight into the next exercise leaving insufficient time to do each exercise,3.0
Jennifer Pantone,Functional,"I was notified by my bank of an unfamiliar transaction from BetterMe. I did not sign up for a paid subscription and have not been able to locate in my Google play account of any BetterMe trial subscription. I am requesting a refund. I'm not saying it was a fraud charge, but when I'm trying to cancel a free trial and there is nothing showing in my account to cancel, yet I'm still charged, that sounds a little scammy. As far as the actual app itself, it's a 3 star for me. Could be better.",3.0
yvonne chan,Functional,"This app truly has potential, love that the developer added the music and audio instructions in the wall pilates, would be great if they can do the same in the daily workout video too. Also I cannot find unit oz to g option in the meal plan, it's so inconvenient that I had to look for unit conversion in google and then go back to the app to type the right number.",3.0
Stella Chen,Functional,"Confusing app. Paid for the year, and suddenly saing meal plan is not available need to pay extra. Also as app updating, wall plate work out became not challenging enough. Too much of stretching not much strength training.",3.0
Jen C,Functional,Food tracker does not allow to track in Cups or tsp's. Etc. Only ounces / grams Very inconvenient. Cannot plan ahead entering meals for next day,3.0
Angelica McDonough,Functional,Review subject to change! (2 week trial period) I am on a journey of self improvement as a 27yo woman. so far I am enjoying the app after a few days. the list format for daily activities is great for me and each task is fairly easy to complete. I'm liking the water and food tracker. I have NEVER counted calories or watched how much I ate but this app makes that easy and fun too since I can scan the barcode of my foods.,3.0
ZanÃ© Van Wyk,Functional,"Still new to the idea, but liking it thus far. Will really like it if I see results",3.0
Naida Marin,Functional,"I don't mind the workouts, but I do mind that they don't give you time to change positions. The whole app is silent minus when the timer gets to 5 seconds. The price is crazy for what the app offers.",3.0
Aaron Lessels,Functional,Have only just started but can feel the stretching of muscles that obviously don't get worked in my line of work or lifestyle. So am looking forward to being more flexible and strengthening my weak areas.,3.0
LAURA LUET,Functional,App with great potential. I would recommend paying extra attention when subscribing to the app to understand the price of the app and adds on. I got confused there but the support team was really helpful to give me extra information and help me review my subscription.,3.0
Jane Horton,Functional,Would be great if I could put this on my TV using chromecast. The move from one activity to the next is very fast when you don't know what's coming and I'm just looking at a little phone. Might get easier to transition when I have done it a few times.,3.0
Cindy Jeffords,Functional,"The coach only comminicates via app and is in a time zone around the world. Hoping they male updates based on my feedback given, could only post a pic of food not type and for someone who is new to all this it is easy to forget. Also could not go in and post missed info from day before for tracking. Meal planning had some recipes I could not find in store and I only tried a couple excercises which seemed okay.",3.0
Maddie Bryant,Functional,"The workouts are great and help me feel more connected to my body. The app is only allows you one somatic exercise set per day, which has its pros and cons. It's good for not feeling overwhelmed. However, I like staying up late and doing the somatic exercises before I go to sleep, sometimes around midnight. But then I can't access the next day's workout until past midnight on the next day. It would be great to access the workouts whenever I want.",4.0
Vanessa Ratliff,Functional,"Id give a 5 but the bugs. My big issue is it not refreshing the daily exercise from my personal plan. Ive had one workout stuck for two days. I did it the first day and it showed it was been saved but still two days later, its still the same one. Usually id get stuck on the walking exercise but this time it's a regular one. I try to skip through and save it but not sure how to fix now. Other than that, great app with amazing options.",4.0
Zlatan Jurinovic,Functional,It's a good app. I wish they would give you alternative food plan options for when you don't have all the ingredients. The videos do start off pretty fast and you can rewind which is kinda stupid. It also doesn't tell you what the next exercise is so you lose a few seconds for each workout cause your trying to figure what what to do. Overall it's okay,4.0
da.misterfister aka tX3d0b0xXr,Functional,"App has so much potential, but there needs to be more time in between exercises!! Some ideas could be to add a 3, 5 or 10 second timer in between with a preview of what the next workout is (can be an option in the settings for a timer or to just have it paused in general with a clip preview of what the workout is). Having the workout start immediately, especially when we dont know what is next, not only interrupts the flow of our workout but takes up more time!! Im sure yall get these a lot!",4.0
Shane Riggie,Functional,"Good app with good exercises. Would be nice if there was a 10 second or so pause between workouts to show what the next exercise is and give a chance to set up. When it jumps from standing to laying down or laying on your stomach then switching to back, it takes a moment and by the time you've checked your phone to see what you're doing, you've missed the first 10 seconds of that exercises.",4.0
Gwen Maurello,Functional,"Updated: oh this app is so much better with the new update. It now gives directions for each exercise with transition time in between. It did reset my account back to day 1 prior to the update, so hoping that won't happen again. Definitely much easier to use and I really enjoy the simple but great exercises. There's also so many easy options to add on based on what I need. Thank you for listening and making some great changes!",4.0
Graceful Space,Functional,"I liked the Wall Pilates exercises. The verbal instructions + video were pretty easy to follow, EXCEPT: 1. From the camera angle used, you couldn't tell how close to the wall the model's butt was for each exercise. 2. The verbal instructions didn't always match what the model was doing. 3. During the cool-down the model didn't move at all, so there was no visual demonstration of the verbal instructions. 4. The cool-down only used one side of the body without repeating it for the other side.",4.0
Gilbert Perez,Functional,"As the workouts continue, I noticed there is no minor pause for you to switch to the next position. Once that position is done, it automatically changes, and the timer starts. I believe it should change, & wait a couple to a few seconds for the switch pose. There is no pause button if in case you need it.",4.0
A Ro,Functional,"My original post was 2 stars. I finally spoke with a person about my concerns. The app has drastically improved. There is a review of the steps prior for wall pilates. The band doesn't take you to the coach, but in your plan, you have to message a coach via the black chat bubble on the top right side. I like the challenges titles and stuff but find it hard to pay $10+/ each month for one. I don't buy coffee every day, so it isn't just a budget move thing.",4.0
Kelly Benedetti,Functional,"I'm only on day 3 of the trial period, but I'm not only NOT disappointed with a wellness app, I'm actually impressed! Quick workouts, easy and delicious meal recipes, psychology hacks, fasting tracker, and helpful reminders. I figured I'd quit before the trial ended, but I might just keep it! I just wish the challenges were included, or at least cheaper, since the app itself isn't cheap.",4.0
Michelle Fox,Functional,"I'd I could give a 4 1/2 stars I would. There's a lot of great workout options. The wall palates is the reason I got it, and I love it. They seem to be updating/improving the videos to address customer concerns. I've been using around 2+ mths. I've had a handful of peoplebask if I lost weight. I haven't, but I have toned up my middle section, which was my goal.",4.0
swanson20,Functional,"This app is easy to use. Other reviews stated that there was not enough transition time between each exercise, but I found that you can pause the video. My only request would be to have the option to rewind and start from the beginning of the timer once I'm in position and have a full understanding of the move. Or maybe include a preview video between each exercise that shows how to do it while we get into position.",4.0
Monica S,Functional,"The transitions in the videos are not great, there is no time to reset and they constantly go from standing to sitting to standing to sitting without time to get into position. Otherwise, I really enjoy the exercises, there are a lot of different ones available that focus on different areas. I also like the food tab with the different healthy suggestions and calories. There is also an intermittent fasting guide that is good.",4.0
Ruth Hansen,Functional,"I've liked the app for the most part. I like all the different things that are included besides just the walk pilates. Two Changes that would be extremely helpful. On the wall pilotes, Having transition time between the different exercises. Even 5 seconds to get your body in position for the next move. Audible instructions naming the next exercise as well as basic how to instructions. Sometimes by the time I figure out what I'm supposed to be doing the timer is half gone.",4.0
Debbie Valloni,Functional,"I like the whole concept of this app. I have some of the same issues as well. I do like that now you have changed up the videos with timers to get into position before the next exercise starts and verbal instruction. So Much Better! The problem though was when that update happened, it took me back to day one and I had to start all over again. That part not so good. Still milling around with the other options but overall I like it.",4.0
Jana Soroski,Functional,I'm new but so far pleasantly surprised. I kept seeing the ads on my social media and thought I'd give it a try. The workouts feel great and are customized to my profile survey. Only complaint is there is no tutorial to learn the moves that I have been able to find on the app and there is no break to change position from standing to floor work. I just hit pause to get set up and move the phone.,4.0
Randi Lu,Functional,"So this is day #2 with the app but my first day using it. So far, I have just done the stretches but it irritated me that the exercises weren't consistently on the ground or standing up. One would have you standing, the next would have you lying down, the next standing, the next lying down, etc etc. And there is no option to rewind that I can see and they don't give you time to get on the ground or stand so I am constantly scurrying to pause to try and get into position. Otherwise, awesome.",4.0
Tina Rosenbaum,Functional,I like that it has a certain set of exercises to do without having to figure it for myself. However I wish that it had sound & talked you through on what to do without having to try and look at my phone while trying to quickly get in position and already starting it late and maybe a play button or pause at least so as to have time to get in position for the next exercise. I'm thinking/hoping it'll motivate me to do daily but not what I expected thus far.,4.0
Drew Moore,Functional,Like the app so far only a few things I would add or change. 1. There should be a grocery list option that easily takes the suggested meal plans and creates the list. Going through every meal and writing down the list is too much work for something that could be achieved easily thru the app. 2. The workout section. This may just be me but I can't seem to find an option to change the suggested workouts from home workouts to gym workouts.,4.0
Monica â€œSaraiahâ€,Functional,"it is useful! but having the ad on the front as you enter the app everytime is really annoying. the app doesnt seem to flow if that makes any sense... it has great information but the design just feels outdated and non-interactive. exercises have no tips about form. so unless you have had some previous fitness experience, please be careful following some of these moves.",4.0
Gdess 2001,Functional,I'm having a ton of technical issues with the site. It will work then it won't. It crashes often. The customer service has been very helpful but I wish the app worked better especially since I'm paying for it. 7/23 edit. After the technical issues were resolved I can honestly say I'm really enjoying this app now. I love the meal plan aspect I really enjoy all the workouts (there's even dance workouts) the 'add food' tab is a bit limited but overall I'm really loving the app now. I might renew.,4.0
Wendy Fanucchi,Functional,"I just completed day 1. I have enough exercise experience to have been able to follow even though it was slightly unfamiliar. There is no transition time given between exercises, which is tricky, especially with moving from floor to standing. There are no explanations and no talking through. You can pause as you go, so keep your phone or device near you. TBD. It got me moving, which I needed.",4.0
Emily Lindauer,Functional,"I think the monthly fee is a bit high, luckily I was able to get a deal for a yearly amount. Otherwise, I would've deleted the app. Also, you have to pay to participate in challenges?? This is over and above your monthly subscription, that just says greed to me. Might as well pay and go to a regular gym for all the fees. I just downloaded it also so, I may change this review at a later date.",4.0
Andrew Tuipelehake,Functional,"The app is pretty useful. I like the fasting tracker, the workout tracker, and the workout plans for at home and in the gym. The only things I would want changed is an automatic start and stop to the fasting tracker, bc I forget to restart it but i see that i can edit the time and date if i need to, and I would want the meal plan to be apart of the subscription. Even though you get a basic meal plan, It seems you have to pay for it separately if you want the full functionality of the plan.",4.0
Veronica Farone,Functional,"I love this app and how it goes into the psychology of weight loss, and the exercise is perfect for me. The only frustrating part is the menu. I can't view previous days' food intake, and I can't save certain meals that I eat daily. It would also be helpful if the measurements were in cups instead of ounces. Otherwise, I highly recommend it!",4.0
Susan Moore,Functional,"So far, so good. Only 4 stars because there is no verbal guidance during the exercises. Leads to guesswork. If that changes, or if the feature is easier to find, will gladly rethink to upgrade to the 5 stars. Also: Hard sell on the fitness bands. Only app requiring location to log workputs on google fit. Please change that. Costly enough- $210 / year. Yet, still selling new features and challenges by the month -that adds up. Better marketing strategy, and I would buy!",4.0
Tiffany Thomsen,Functional,Nice for accountability though there are some issues. Exercises/workout are just challenging enough and paced well. I find the calorie tracker definately needs improvement. Everything is listed in ounces and I don't measure much of the food I eat that way. I use cups and tablespoons much more frequently. When you scan the barcode it is always messed up for serving size and calories associated. I have been using another calorie tracking app and just loading for total calories manually.,4.0
Karen Knudson,Functional,"I really love that the exercises are explained so you can read them before actually doing the workout. I also love that they workouts aren't an hour long. My only critique is that there needs to be 5 to 10 seconds in-between to get set up for the next exercise. I have to grab my phone, pause it, then resume when I'm set up. Other than that, it's great!",4.0
Samantha G,Functional,"Unfortunately, I just downloaded the app and paid for the trial subscription, but the wall workouts are not working. I'm having the same issue that others are mentioning about how the app tells you you don't have access to the internet or that you need to try again later ðŸ˜£ I can still use the other features of the app though. Edit: I re-downloaded the app a few days later and the Wall Pilates showed up (didn't work the day of). Excited to jump in and will reach out to support with any Qs. Thnx!",4.0
Draven the Leo,Functional,"I downloaded and paid for a subscription thanks to an Instagram Ad. I didn't think that these workouts would be difficult at all until I got on the floor. I'm down 2.7 pounds since I started a few days ago. I'm happy with the app, it's easy to navigate and very simple instructions. I am starting to feel all the weight I've been carrying around with the beginner movements, but it's all about progress. You can do this! (4 stars because I didn't buy the 1 on 1 coaching...can't say it's perfect yet.",4.0
Brittany Jenco,Functional,"The app has some hiccups but the tech team worked to resolve my issue and even gave me a month free subscription. Often I would open it and it would start me back on day 1. To resolve this I would need to close the app down completely and then reopen it. After this, it would open to where I left off. I do think the app is too pricey for what it offers",4.0
inna grinko,Functional,"Too early to tell but one thing I was going to mention about wall exsersises. When trying to look at the phone and change position facing the wall 20 seconds, than completely opposite of facing the fall, then back to facing the wall, it's not user friendly. Have you tried putting all exsersises in one direction and then when done do opposite direction, because it's too much changing, rotating 160 degrees for every excersise and also trying to see the exsersise and do it within alloted time.",4.0
Leilani M,Functional,"The app is pretty good, but I don't have time to make most of the recipies and there's no way to find recipies that are faster to make without scrolling through the entire weeks of meal plans. You also can't add a different meal if you chose one different than what is listed for the time slot. I.e. avocado toast instead of oatmeal. I have no idea how much calories are in avocado toast and there are WAY too many options when you enter it manually. (One said 7,000 kcal for one meal!)",4.0
Alexander Rode,Functional,"I believe the app is great BUT when it comes to starting the next exercise. There should be a 3-5 second timer before it actually starts instead of starting immediately and losing 3-5 seconds on the workout because you're still getting into position. If they make that change, the app would be perfect",4.0
Frank Selby,Functional,This was my first workout today so in on day 1. I have a 4 star because I think there should be a heads up of what the next exercise is coming instead of just jumping right to the next one. Especially for individuals not in shape or beginners having difficulty transitioning from exercise to exercise. That's loosing time in between.. overall I like it though!,4.0
Sandra Roarty,Functional,"First, I prefer other measurements options for food....I can't weigh what I eat. And I hope the food database is constantly added to. That's one thing about MFP....you could find most ANY food on there. But this is a good start for a way to monitor your food as well as behaviors. I took a chance and paid for a year. I look forward to more improvements.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love the water tracking because unlike other apps it allows you to choose different ounces without changing the settings. The exercise routine is amazing and you can see an illustration that moves real time. I didnt give it 5 stars because the calorie counting feature does not have a database as extensive as other apps, so you may not find some brands. Also, the steps count is based on your phone. I have a smart watch, the app doesnt allow you to edit the steps and not sure I can link them.",4.0
Heather,Functional,"I'm a new user, but so far I really like it! There is one thing that I have found that could be adjusted IMO. During the timed exercises, there is little to no pause between the current exercise and the next one. Especially as a new user, I find it difficult to anticipate exactly what position I need to be in, which way I should be facing, standing up/on the floor, etc. I try to pause it quickly when one ends and the next begins, but it's a bit of a hassle on my phone app. Otherwise, it's great",4.0
christy d,Functional,"Just started program. What I don't like is requirement to sync your walking activity to Google fit with no option to manually enter your steps if you use another platform. But I do like the other features of food and water tracking. The workouts give step by step visuals. Should be a good program for that. I'm not interested in purchasing the tracker the app promotes, I already have a fitbit. There's a lot of different programs and features that require additional fees.",4.0
Kelly Dempsey,Functional,"Generally, I really like this app. However there is some glitchiness. The workout I did today got stuck right before the cool down. It counted down the rest period and then was stuck. Nothing I clicked worked, so I backed out and it didn't save it or show any if the time I spent working out. Which is slightly defeating. Being able to see that checked off, and track your progress is super motivating.",4.0
Nicole Val,Functional,"The app is good, but on the 8th day for the second time there is no chapter to read. I uninstalled it the first time it happened and the chapters started over again. I had an answer about a week later. Regardless, it is helping me in a lot of aspects and the readings, though only 7, are excellent. Counting calories forces me to eat very healthy but I can also indulge when I want to. Exercises don't have a rest period but there's a lot of routines in the library and recipes for every diet.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I enjoy the variety of exercises and the meal suggestions. However, there are two reasons that I cannot give it five stars. 1. The workout program is not adaptive. If a workout is consistently marked as very hard, modifications should be offered. Also, there are no suggestions for combining workouts. Does it make sense to combine arms and back, or would flat stomach and back work better, etc.",4.0
Chas Saxon,Functional,"I had problems at first, after purchasing a subscription the purchase wouldnt appy. The company couldnt fix it and I asked for a refund. They offered me a discount to try again and the last time it finally worked. I'm glad, I do like not having to plan meals and work outs or find them on my own, I like the water and calorie tracker. The fasting tracker I wish had the time countdown for it and that it displayed the the time you can break the fast, I am still learning to use it but it is handy.",4.0
Ashley Castle,Functional,This is only my first day but the exercises feel geared towards the level I indicated but there is a lot of up and down without a break in between to switch between. There is a pause button but it would be a million times easier if I didn't have to hit it every single time between exercises.... A 10 second delay between exercises would go a long way.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really love this app. I love that they tons of vegetarian options in the menu. The meals are delicous. I have gone outside of my comfort zone to try a few of them, and they have all been great. I love that you can add the items to your grocery list and check off items as you purchase them for each recipe. The app could be imporved if there was a way to save the recipes that you liked, that way you could easily go back to them. I also wish there was a way to see all the recipes in the database because there was one I saw that I can't find after I reinstalled the app. I also like the workouts. I feel like they are great, challenging enough to produce results, but not too challenging where I feel too intimidated to try. I did have an issue with the workouts, where I was unable to view the instructions because it would say I was not connected to the internet. This is why I reinstalled the app and lost some of the recipes I saved previously. This also did not fix the issue. I did reach out for support and they did address my concern, however there was no soultion to fix the issue. This is a really great app, but there is some room for improvement. The recipes alone are a reason for me to enjoy the app, not to mention the workouts. I think once these issues are addressed the app would be perfect.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I only have the free version, so no food tracking. If i wasn't on a strict budget i'd probably go a head and pay for the full version. Free version is good but as with any free app they're constantly trying to sell you the full version; at times they make it seem that certain functions are only available with purchace but the majority of the time, just decline the offer and it will continue to the function you selected.",4.0
Amanda sparks,Functional,Love it! I feel good not too over worked. I have some back problems and it goes easy for my back. The only thing I would say is to maybe have a few seconds between work outs to figure it out. I waste like 10 sec trying to get it right. Also tje fasting portion would be nice to put it in manually how many hours I've fasted. Other than that I love this app sticking with it. Feel good so far had it for about a month,4.0
Veronica Rosqvist,Functional,"I'm going to start with the 'newbie' exercises, then I'll rate the app. I have been getting reminders to drink water, exercise and chart meals. I like that. I haven't put meals in because it's difficult to get the right amount of what I've eaten. When I think I've done it right there are more calories than I get on my net diary. I will get started with the newbie exercises for now. Did the newbies - it was good to get moving again.",4.0
RUSTY DIXON,Functional,"Customer service is very attentive, polite, and most of all helpful. I was never able to find out how to start a free trial (as the website touts) so I figured I would try it out anyway. I realized this app/system is not for me as I like some of the other ones better. Overall it's a decent app/system with a good start. I think if they continue to listen to user/customer feedback, this will develop really well. This would have replaced not only fitness tracking apps, but dietary as well.",4.0
Kristie Masemer,Functional,"I like it and I'm going to keep doing it because I have goals and made the purchase/commitment for 3 months. However, the workouts could make more sense. They go from a mat being parallel to the wall to being vertical constantly so you make a decision to keep the mat to the benefit of you for the majority of the time which is vertically. They go from up to down workouts constantly with no flow. I lose time doing each move because I need to watch what shes doing then reposition myself completely.",4.0
Robin Mead,Functional,"I really like this app! There are a few things that need improvement though. When entering foods eaten to keep track of calories, there isn't much of a database to choose from and the barcode scanner doesn't always recognize the barcodes. It just makes it hard to accurately keep track of calories. Also I think it would be helpful if you could change the units to something other than oz.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"i love the workout animations, the reminders are great and I really feel like I get a good burn going when I do them. I don't like the meal plans, they are limited and a little too many ingredients are needed everyday to follow so it can get really expensive and possibly wasteful. The subscription price is pretty hefty too but I was willing to consider it until I saw what all the meal plans looked like. Healthy options just not a realistic grocery list, and not enough customization, like vegan.",4.0
Angel Carmona,Functional,"Here's the thing; nothing you do with this app, you can't simply do on your own, BUT, because this app has everything, (reminders, meal ideas, exercises, etc...), it has been a great motivator. It's weird, I've tried intermittent fasting in the past and the best I'd do, was while asleep. When I set this app to turn on my fasting time, I stick to it and then some, like a challenge. I'm reminded about water intake and to eat well while in my eating window. Little things like that are ðŸ‘",4.0
Lisamarie,Functional,"Edit 1/5/23 this is very much like Noom. Almost exactly, but without a coach and with the added benefit of workout options. They do need a way to go back and restart the exercise I don't see a way to do that. Also I'm screencasting this on my TV but it certainly would also be amazing if this app was available on the smart TV so that you could just do the workout without screen casting",4.0
A Google user,Functional,I saw an ad on pinterest and thought I would give it a try since I have been struggling with finding meals to easily make. I have been trying to cut out meat and this app gives you an option for vegetarian which is great. you can track your weight and how much water you are drinking each day. it's helped me get on a good track. the only problem i have is that it looks like it gives you the same meal plan every week.so.I'll probably delete it soon. I can't eat the same thing every week ðŸ˜–,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's been great to keep me on track and get a good full body work out. I wish the app could generate a grocery list depending on my meal plan. I want to keep up with eating good but it's hard when I have to go through n look at every meal from eveyday to see what I need to pick up. Maybe customize it to where the person can pick out a day of the week for a reminder to pick of what is needed. Other than that, it's a really great app.",4.0
Sree Ray,Functional,"It's a pretty good app to use for a quick workout before or after work. There are a variety of exercises to keep it interesting. A suggestion that I would like to give is a ""Next Exercise"" notification during each of the exercises. Either that or a few seconds to read and set up after each exercise. Since some of the exercises are less than 30 seconds, there is not much time to read the next exercise and transition to it.",4.0
Claire Whorton,Functional,"It's tracking is pretty good (water, food when you follow their plan, weight, etc.) and has a good interface to understand your stats. Also decent food ideas even for the laziest like me, but my grievance is with the workout portion. It's definitely made for someone who has intense goals (even the goal chart shows my ""goal"" is advanced fitness guru in 4 months), wanting me to crunch out some hardcore work. I'm chronically ill, so that wasn't my plan and you can't change it. Just not for me.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I like the concept and it functions well so far. I shop weekly and I would like to be able to access the ingredients that I will need for the week to ensure I can prep the meal options given or modify for allergies. I also like that you can customize food preferences but would like to see a way to indicate specific allergies. Other than that, I think this will be a useful resource to my weightloss goals.",4.0
Julie Guerin,Functional,"I like the reminders telling you to work out, start/stop fasting etc. The light reading they provide isn't too complicated or insightful but it does help keep your mind on track. As someone just starting off, it would be nice if they gave you any sort of guidance during the workouts- they just move from one exercise to the next, and the countdown starts immediately. You don't have time to transiston, and there's no instructions on how your body should be- just the computer instructor to watch",4.0
Bethany Batton,Functional,"I somehow signed up twice and dealt with some frustrations from that, but the BetterMe team helped to get that sorted out and offered a great solution for me! I enjoy the app, and the workouts are easy to fit into my busy schedule. I like that you can preview the individual parts of the workout before starting it, so you can be prepared with everything you'll need! I do the shorter 15-20 minute workouts, and I can feel that they're working!",4.0
ã‚·á´˜á´,Functional,"Good workouts but... I really enjoy the workouts this app has to offer. I really see and feel the difference in my body after every workout. However, I think that a 10-15 second interval in between each workout to switch into the next workout starting position would greatly improve the app. It would allow the user to get the full extent of the workout instead of pausing right before the workout starts to adjust their body to the next exercise. Hope you take this constructive criticism to heart!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Pretty good. I like how you can track your water intake, the exercises are simple & quick. Everyone complaining about the cost obviously didn't fully read the payment options. I chose the monthly payment option of $9.99 so I didn't have to pay the price up front which IS stated on the app. It's broken down to how much it cost a month but it DOES say you will be charged the full $60 upfront. You can cancel anytime by pulling up at the app in the Play Store. Overall good app, just read carefully.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I really like the app but for the cost it should provide more. You can't go back to the previous week to look at meals and menus. It should give the nutritional content of the meals. It should give more workout options. Incorporate weights, HIIT, etc. A template for measurements would be nice too.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I started using this app as the trial but I will continue using it after my subscription. love keto option. Would be nice to customize your food choices esp if you don't like something, this app chooses meal plans for you.. for example radishesðŸ¤¢, would be nice to skip that meal and choose another one in its place. Generally, I would just pick something from another meal on a different day of the week, but it would be nice to have the skip option and have it replaced with another meal.",4.0
Wdoc155,Functional,"The app as a while Is fine. I dont even mind paying. However, the only workouts it allows you to input are the ones on the app. Also, all the food is measured starting ar 3.55 something ounces. You adjust with a slide scale which makes it difficult to be accurate. Overall, I like it and will continue to use it.",4.0
Sh0t Dead,Functional,Really like it so far! The meal plan takes the last minute panic out of figuring out what to eat throughout the week. I've only done a few days so far so my only complaint at the moment is that the wall pilates exercises aren't voiced and the instructor doesn't demo the exercise at all before the timer starts. With or without voice I'd prefer to have a chance to watch the move before the timer starts.,4.0
Robert Lease,Functional,"For my first time using your app (and because I am very out of shape and have neuropathy in my feet), I had some difficulty keeping up with the app, which seemed to change from one exercise to another too quickly, esp. since I had to figure out a way to either hold my phone or keep it in sight so that I could SEE the video examples, since there was no sound to the videos AND since many of the exercises require you to hold onto the chair, move around the chair, AND use your other arm, as well.",4.0
Rosalind Kopinski,Functional,I like that the workouts are in a challenge type form(ticking off daily) it helps with my Audhd brain to have a routine but also a game type challenge to stay interested. The wall pilates is silent which feels a bit strange but the exercises are effective. I feel that the actual challenges should be free (or less expensive) since you pay for the app. Overall I am enjoying this app especially just getting back into working out after yrs out of it. I will probably cancel after discount time tho.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,I love the workouts and the water tracker. The food part seems to assume I have a limitless pool of money. It would be nice if it would give either variants to the plan or maybe more just generalized food programs. Having said that I do however like that they include an ingredient list and a how to make it guide. For those who either have a very well stocked fridge or a good bit of spendable cash laying around with some free time to boot...it's a great thing. :),4.0
Joslynn Garcia,Functional,I like the positivity this apps brings. I like the customized meal plans. The only thing I would change about this app is that it would give me different options for each meal & not just one because if I don't like it or an allergic to it I'm not going to eat it. But overall I think its a great app & great way to get to where you want to be! Very motivating!,4.0
Kim Fitzpatrick,Functional,"So far excellent, easy for set up, data entry, and tracking. Preset/ commercial food choices seen a little limited but that may be more me than the app. Exercise part is short and realistic, most can be done anywhere and sets are timed not counted. Haven't used it long but I find the overall design makes it very likely that I will continue and follow through.",4.0
Kamil Hameed,Functional,"The app per say looks decent with everything that you need to be fit under your finger tips. To be honest I have not used it for ever so I'm a bit skeptical. But from what I see it looks promising. It has diat plans, exercise routines and it keeps you on the tow always which is great. No nonsense adds too for what I expirienced. So all and all good. Hope it won't suck down the journey ðŸ˜‰. And I hope the customer service is up to par, not that I needed them but just in case.",4.0
Nichoelle DeBrouse,Functional,"You need to make sure to read purchase requirements etc, I had a small issue with that not knowing some of the services are purchased separately. It was quickly and respectfully resolved though. It's clear the company is interested in improving the app. It tracks water intake provides meals to your liking as recipes my favorite feature is that you can add recipes to your shopping list and it will arrange the ingredients and amounts. Wish all features were more affordable.",4.0
Rita Stafford,Functional,Edited: This app didn't work at all. I have a subscription and access to the website but the only thing I could do on the app was access and edit my profile. The company's suggestion to uninstall/reinstall fixed that issue. I like the variety of exercise routines and there seems to be enough to never get bored as well as to have new challenges as my fitness improves.,4.0
Danielle Duncan,Functional,"Great app, easy to use. Lots of challenges and daily tracking of food, water, calories, walking and exercise. Drwback is most the workout plans and challenges cost extra and I can't add extra exercises or walking to my total. only adds walking if I have my phone on me and only adds the exercise program that is included. But 2 days now and I'm actually using it. That's never happened.",4.0
Sarah McGrath,Functional,"I started using the Better ME app about a month ago and really feel like it is working for me. This is the first time I have tried intermittent fasting but it has really helped me control my snacking. I have lost 4 pounds just from the structure of only eating during an 8 hour period each day. I've tried the workouts and they could use some work. Each exercise is to be performed for about 20 seconds, but they move from standing to floor without any consistency. They are awkward.",4.0
Andre Gale,Functional,Great app! A few things i wish would change: - when doing a program providing a bit more time to set up between workouts (like 3-5 seconds) would be great. You never know what the next exercise is. - i had 28 day calisthenics program but i didnt complete it and i was hoping to find it again but was unable to. So making programs easier to search would be great I like the programs as i dont have to think about what im going to do the next day. I just follow what it says.,4.0
Jane Wynne,Functional,Well done for listening to all the feedback! ðŸ‘,4.0
Robert Webb,Functional,"Great app for the most part! I only wish there was a way to manually adjust some goals such as daily calories, as I was prescribed by a weight loss physican a specific number to aim for, and the app instead calculates it's own. The daily calorie and food logging also needs work, with no way I can find to look back on previous days to review and copy data over, and limited information when searching foods. Improvment of this system would make this a true all in one app. Other than that, amazin",4.0
Katarina Pupavac,Functional,"The app is ok, but I didn't like that you basically need a wall that is at least 3mx3m empty (no pictures hanging, no forniture nearby, etc). I live in a small flat, so I basically needed to move my paintings and rearrange my chest of drawers to be able to do excercises. Also, there is an excercise where you need to put ur feet on the wall, and stand on your hands- ofc I couldn't do so, and there was no option to mark this particular excercise as difficult (so it was repeating often).",4.0
Chris Tiffen,Functional,"Finding the app easy to use and a couple of good updates recently with timing between exercises etc. The one annoying thing is not being able to see what the following day's workout involves, I got caught by surprise yesterday needing a pull-up bar! I don't have one setup",4.0
Chantal Ferreira,Functional,"I'm still very new to this app, but it has some good features. One thing that would be awesome, though, is to be able to substitute certain ingredients in the recipes offered (not everyone can afford salmon, for example). Another thing that would be a great feature, is to have more strength training (meal plans and exercises). This app is better for beginners, but it's also great for if you need to ease back into things after an operation.",4.0
Andre Mazanek,Functional,Great app with creative and safe exercises for all body parts and situations. I would like to see a feature that previews the next exercise coming up in the series so I don't have to guess and scramble when the timer for the current exercise is up.,4.0
Sandra Da Silva-Creasey,Functional,Good app but moves from exercise to exercise too quickly at times. A shame there is no background upbeat music to go with the exercises too I think it is personalised to a point but I seem to so the same easy exercises again and again but perhaps they are staples of the workout.,4.0
Dharmendra Parmar,Functional,It's good to have a range of workouts for all. GREAT COLLECTION ðŸ‘,4.0
Lola Granola,Functional,"Just got the app and wall pilates 28-day challenge, I'm on day 2 and so far so good. I got the 1-on-1 coaching option but I'm not sure if it was worth it, the coach is never available, only answers once a day, and hasn't really given me anything yet, just asking vague questions. But I'm only one second day, still want to give it a fair go before I get too judgemental.",4.0
Adele Mutiba,Functional,"App is great and exervises are awesome, however would be great if I could chromecast the workouts.

BoYtOy 760,Functional,"It has potential and needs work. I like that it's going to help me lose weight. The problem that I have with it is similar to others. There's absolutely no demonstration before the workout begins. Once you finally learn the move, you're halfway through the session. Also, I'm not sure, but I haven't found a way to link it to my big TV. I can only use it on my phone.",4.0
Rona S,Functional,"The APP is full of ways to encourage you to keep exercising and becoming better at making good choices. At 60, getting up and down to floor is exercise in itself. I love the feeling of my core strengthening throughout the day. Highly recommend it.",4.0
Lisette Garfio,Functional,"I like it so far, the food recipes are easy for me to make, the excercises and advice they give to follow are good. I think this app will work out for me to lose weight. It's all about being consistent and following weight loss goals.",4.0
Angela Beckum,Functional,"The first workout was nice & pleasant which I'd expect for it to get harder. Only thing I dislike is that when doing the floor workouts I don't Ike having to get up and down off the floor. Let floor workouts be more consistent together than separate. And stand up be with stand up. That's tiresome within itself, up down, up down. I don't like it.",4.0
D'Andrea Seabrook,Functional,this is a day 1 opinion but doing exercises is a little more challenging for me as a person recovering from a knee injury because they alternate floor and standing exercises instead of grouping them together however it was still doable. I like that the exercises ramp up as you go along and help condition you for future mobility.,4.0
Angela Taylor,Functional,"I was really enjoying this app until I was logged out and was unable to sign back in.

Leah Stevens,Functional,"Love it. Love the mindfulness @nd gentle stretches after a busy busy day.

I am plant based but would like to try vegan keto. No luck with customer service.",4.0
yvette danganan,Functional,"It's refreshing. I would like there to be a pause or show of next workout move (option).

A Google user,Functional,Please have an option to pre-download the videos or workouts and use them offline. (An example would be Spotify. They let users download the songs and use them offline). We dont have any wifi connection at the gym. :( OR please have an option to export the videos to a lower resolution so it is accessible even in mobile data.

A Google user,Functional,"I am 40 yrs old was diagnosed with MS late 2016. My muscles and strength suffer from time to time. All my research says exercise is helpful.

Long story short, I am glad I found Better Me, I have actually stuck with the daily challenges and look forward to completing my 28 day challenges.   This is my first completed week and I am already feeling more energized and less fatigue like I normally do.

The personalized meal plan and additional challenges do cost extra but those are completely optional and affordable!",5.0
**,Functional,"I've only used it a few times. It's a little different from traditional videos- no annoying voices, just a person doing the excercises.

I used to excercise a lot, then life and a few things like osteoporosis and stenosis set in. Before things ruin my body, I figured I better get moving. So far, so good! I'd definitely recommend it.",5.0
Keith G,Functional,"Bought 3 month plan. Weigh 320. Started exercising. Great workout. 16 minutes. Sweating profusely. When going from standing to floor exercises & vice versa would be nice if you had a few seconds in between for transition, especially for us obese folks. While sound not necessary, you have to keep looking at your screen to see when exercise ends. An optional countdown for last 3 to 5 secs would be helpful. The suggested meals I have scanned over look tasty. I like the layout of the app so far. Thx",5.0
Kantenga Jack,Functional,What a better experience for me is to add a start button for each move. Give your clients a few seconds to get into position to do each move at its given time increment. I found myself not actually doing the full workout cause I used up some of that time to reposition myself and the mat several times throughout the workout. I have really enjoyed the services.,5.0

Daniel CIUCA,Functional,"A very good work out online platform. Suggestion: for each exercise, start counting after several seconds, in order to give the user chance to understand how to take the next position and the necessary movements. After the exercise, when the counting stops, let 5-10 seconds before moving to the next, while the next exercise is already announced with a small picture about it. This, will give the user time to better prepare for what's next. I fully recommend the application.",5.0

Every visit to the dr, the app generates a message saying that that x number of new conditions were added and y number of new meds were added. The problem is that these ""new"" items are actually just a repeat of my previous conditions and meds. Also, I use it mostly for getting RXs refilled. You'd think on the home screen there would be a BIG button for that, but NO! You have to go about 3 levels down to get a refill. Also, the medical records on the app are NOT linked at all to the dr's medical records system, so: 1) if the dr changes a condition, it won't show up on the app and 2) you can remove any condition or med on the app at your discretion. Awful system design, poorly executed. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1.0

In MyChart I may not get a reply from who I messaged and many so called medical professionals and most of them don't read the vital information and most is ignored. I wish I knew how to download all my important information in this app in my cellphone and take it to a law firm.,2.0

A Google user,Functional,The two is because I can't get it to work on my tablet. Works on my phone and my computer. Many of the Play store apps don't work on my tablet I don't understand why developers wouldn't want apps to work on tablets when so many people have iPads and Galaxy tablets.

Diane Esbeck- Nichols,Functional,"Maybe drs can get in, I can't.

A Google user,Functional,Its helpful to get a hold of the doctor using emails and also having all your info in 1 spot. Unfortunately there is no way to delete an old provider in the system.

I didn't find out there was a ""delivery failure"" until hours later. Very unhelpful. Tried getting in touch with support - nothing. While this isn't an emergency, it is time sensitive and it is easier to send a message directly as opposed to calling the office and having someone transcribing the problem for me.

Thomas Lunsford,Functional,"This app could be good, but user experience has not at all been considered. For example, I had to click through a dozen different log entries to find my labs info, and the labs are a blob of table text, not organized into any sort of data set. And the app still shows my old preferred pharmacy a year after I changed to a new one, the one my doctor knows; the app does let me change it, but I don't dare change a thing in the app that's already working at the doc.

The text in the results from labs gets all jumbled up because the font size vs display space is not calculated correctly which leaves you with charts that are impossible to read.",2.0
Aaron Lathrop,Functional,"Significantly lower rating because the making appointments feature never seems to do anything.

Shirley Smajd,Functional,"Can't look back further than a couple months in results history. After you scroll so far, it constantly refreshes and bounces you back to the beginning, just as you've found what you're looking for.

I now have to call my doctor's office for something that is on the app, I just can't get to it. There is no new data, so STOP the arbitrary refresh.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app is easy to use and navigate but needs some minor changes to make it more user friendly. The action center notifications need to be fixed to reflect actual needs and the patient needs to have the ability to delete these items if they don't apply/or are done. I don't like that all medical info is grouped by category and not doctor. All meds,conditions,allergies,ect. are all grouped as one. It should be under each doctor for easy access. This is why I keep seeing duplicates of all things.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,easy to use and navigation is clear. the two stars are the penalty for occasional glitches that bring the whole program down. not a problem unless you depend on it. that's 1.5 stars because it's happened a few inconvenient times. the other .5 is for provider responsiveness. some are better than others.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's still a great tool to have. But the new update shows less information than before.

Personally, that was one of my favorite features.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app is just okay. I could be so much more though. First, I think your office visits should be listed in date order according to newest on top, so you are viewing the most current. I have to weed out my last visit somewhere in the middle of the list.

I was looking for one appointment in February with my pcp, I believe to check the time and it wasn't listed, luckily you called with a reminder.",3.0
Vim T,Functional,"Update: The app its self is ok, some of the information around results is clunky like some users you can not mark all read at once you have to go into each result and it's a lot.

Original post: 4/5 so far so good, easy to use very convenient",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Not well organized, I think the most disappointing part about it is sometimes new and old items don't get marked properly so you'll open it and you can't tell if an item is new or not. There's no way to organize it at all. You can't change house listed or anything. It seems like it was a very quickly thrown together and barely better than calling the secretary and asking her directly.",3.0
Bethany Duquette,Functional,Needs more options. I really like the idea of the app but its missing stuff. There should be a way to pay bills within the app with your credit card and view all of your bills due. Instead I have to depend on my mailed bills and figure out if I have paid it or not and then it transfers you to the hospital website. I think you would get more payments if it was better utilized for billing.,3.0
Angie Quinby,Functional,"I have to uninstall and reinstall far too many times in order to have the most recent info. Messages to doctor are hit and miss; sometimes they just disappear.

Merlene Peay,Functional,I liked the old one better. It gave more information. I broke some ribs in the first part of June yet it tells you to click on the number to see the x-rays that has never came through. The information from the revere instacare is not on there. A while back they had to update my file because a whole lot of stuff was not there,3.0
Monica Brand - Arroyo,Functional,Would be very helpful if us patients could leave a message for MD or staff AND it would equally helpful if we could request an appointment.,3.0

Brian Meagher,Functional,App is now buggy. Throwing errors when trying to read messages. Android 11. Update 12/16/22: I've been using it more lately due to surgery. Still a little wonky and is telling me it can't gather data from my two providers. So I can only see one provider at a time. I'm adding one star to make it three. It works okay.,3.0
Ben Owen,Functional,"It works, but I find the appointment and messaging systems to be less than stellar. For the messages, it's not possible to reply to a specific message from your doctor's office directly. Rather, you have to send a general message to your physician and hope the same person reads it. Works, but feels less reliable. As for appointments, it doesn't let you give availability when you request one. It's either first available or 1+ weeks out. A slight tweak to allow for more granularity would be great.",3.0
Tara DiD,Functional,You're faster than menDent mobile. Your messages are good. Your layout isn't horrible for the main page. I'm always confused on should I send feedback to you or the hospital. Cener health shows blood work results much better. If there's something wrong you can see and read you can click on it and see all the past reading maybe steal that. There's site wants access to my phone and it doesn't give me the option to say only when I'm using you that's creepy I don't think you do that.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Like the ability to communicate with my physician and love access to my test results.

A Google user,Functional,"It's ok, I tend to get alot of alerts that are odd. It will have my diagnosis one second and then they'll all be listed as new again.

Thomas Ruwart,Functional,"Intuitive to use. However, when I went to Upload a File, it asked if I wanted to upload a ""File"" or an ""Image"". I clicked on ""File"" because I wanted to upload a PDF.

OneEyed Jack,Functional,"Ive had nothing but problems since the last update. My pharmacy keep getting inactivated and shown as no longer available, even though the state website says it is. I can not make appointments, without the app closing out and returning to the log in screen . I keep getting the run around, with tech support telling me that it's my provider making the changes, while my provider says it's a site support issue .",3.0
Wenzel Ablola,Functional,I like how the app can provide a lot of details from your provider and setting up appointments. The only piece I believe it lacks is the ability to reply to your doctor's message. There is no way to reply to the same message. You would need to create a new message that can have a high risks of losing previous conversations on the same topic. Please add feature to be able to reply to original message without creating a new message.,3.0
Samantha Kelly,Functional,"Great way to keep up to date with appointments, last weight, blood pressure, results and wellness reports. Unfortunately the messaging fails a lot. Doesn't load and I can't update the app again there's no new update. Only app I have issues with. Shuts out on me.",3.0
nicole morris,Functional,"Have used app for a few years and it works relatively well.

A Google user,Functional,"Very unhappy with the issue of looking for something, finding it. Then it hangs up with the neverending circle... there is no easy way of refreshing. You have to close out, wait 5 or 10 minutes then come back and stay over again Extremely frustrating!!",3.0
Jen Kinkead,Functional,Overall it's been olay but I've been unable to receive the emails that my provider has sent me for the past couple of weeks (it says I have 2 unread messages) and my mailbox folders won't load. I've tried reinstalling the app and support doesn't provide any help with this issue. Help!!,3.0
Philip Oeffler,Functional,It's a nice app informative just wish it had a better way to clean it up I just opened it for the first time and there's hundreds of stuff I have to go through..... You're not understanding it had years of information prior to me downloading and using the app that's a lot of information to go through and have to remove one-by-one instead of having some type of system where we can group everything together and delete information that's unwanted and unnecessary,3.0
Juanita Reyes-Burke,Functional,"This is mediocre at best, would love to be able to print lab results on one page and there is no access to the app via webpage. If there is its elusive to me!

Robert Barry,Functional,"I found it lacking with respect to any type of orientation. I finally stumbled onto several ways I could use it (after a year), I would like to see some easy to decipher seamless statement of one's health condition(s) page. It would be 'self updating'.",3.0
James Schran,Functional,What was a great app has been slipping from a patient user standpoint. More and more it is harder to see current updates with all the historical info given.

A Google user,Functional,"It's a good idea, but if the various doctors and providers don't utilize it, it's worthless. Now that Trump and his MAGAts have completely overthrown ACA, nobody will use this. So, overall this app is really good, in theory. You will just have to try it in your area to see if your providers are on it. I had to give it 3 stars based on the fact that it was only able to turn up 4 providers within 100 mile radius of me. And there is no feature to allow you to request your physician to utilize it.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I think the app and the program are awesome, BUT, when you post numbers from blood tests and other types of tests, instead of just listing test numbers in black or red, you should also list the acceptable ranges so we could see how bad or how good the numbers actually are.",3.0
Jane Meyers,Functional,It provides an easy method to send/receive messages between your orthopedic doctor and staff. It gives the patient an organized easy to access complete record of every appointment and results of all imaging and physical therapy treatments that are printable. I wish though that there was patient education concerning condition and behavior modification tips available to on the portal for patients to refer to between appointments.,3.0
Jessica McCann,Functional,"This app is ok. I wish it was more like Epic, which Cleveland clinic uses. Yu can't search your test results for a specific test,instead you have to scroll through all of them. Also, you can't compare the same test to others you've had. Everything else is ok. I like being able to message my Dr directly. I can't remember of you canakr an appointment directly from app but that would be good too",3.0
Rich McCarty,Functional,"I am impressed by the leap forward in progress and communication with all my providers. You must inform your provider that you are using this app. The instructions are meant to be user friendly but some frustration should be expected. You search for all your SIU providers, send request. There will be emails and phone text messages that you will need to sign up, register, and log in. DO NOT TRY TO LOG IN FROM YOUR EMAIL LINK! Use Chrome or another secure web browser and store your PW in browser",3.0
Kenneth Herron,Functional,"The app is great for corresponding with my doctor or nurse and it's great to be able to read the results of my diagnostic tests. However, I've started getting the message, ""Your session has expired....."" Before I even get logged in. And I'm unable to login using the same username and password that I've used before, so I'm unable to use my real email address to login. There needs to be a way to reset my login info so that I can use the same login info as before. I am unable to fix it.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's nice to be able to see my some of my papers, appointments and what not. The two issues I have are: 1. I want to pay online but the portal never works, not app related but the app has the link to take you to a page that does not exist. 2. It shows me as a female. No medical record, civilian or military has ever shown me as female. So I cant for the life of me figure this one out.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great app. Keeps you connected to all of your providers. Keeps you up to date on all of your results, appointments, tests, prescriptions and clinical items. The only thing I would suggest is to not duplicate the clinical items and prescriptions. Every prescription an clinical item is input by each provider which increases the number of records in the lists. Prescriptions should be set to just the prescribing provider. Clinical items should only be connected to provider completing the diagnosis.",3.0
Marcie C,Functional,I find that it could have better features to show all health information and could include more info about past appointments. I would like to view the doctor notes and info recorded for my appointments. It also needs a user friendly update.,3.0
Rita Knull,Functional,"The app works great but I'm not able to attach any forms, photos, or documents to the email. This makes sending forms such as FMLA or photos impossible. This would eliminate the need to fax the documents. Please fix this issue.",3.0
Amber Marie,Functional,Great convenient app I use to contact doctor's get test results etc. but functionality not so great has a hard time signing me in a lot. Lately won't open to a lot of the areas in the app.. just spins. Could be a great app but kind of falls short,3.0
Susan Sackett,Functional,"Recent updates have jammed up my record. And i get a ""new clinical info"" notice every day, when there isnt any. The only unread data are three year old lab reports. However, I can't get to them because the ap will no longer let me scroll down that far. Also, the last time I could, I read all the available results.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"overall good, the inability to reschedule online yourself and waiting for a call back to actually do it seems like it defeats the purpose. I think if it's 24hr before appt you should be able to reschedule online, if said appt is being rescheduled within 24hrs than I can see why you need them to do it. They give opt to msg providers, which is nice. It's great for checking on what you've already done and whats to come as for appt and times.",3.0
Mixedcolors,Functional,This app is annoying but useful. Im always getting alerts thats there new updated documents or messages in my profile when its just infomation thats already been there for a long time. It keeps showing me the same results.,3.0

Darlene Jackson,Functional,I like everything except not being able to see the drs detailed notes or information as to results of my visits. Its confusing & I pretty well understand my health.

Robin Pajarita Wood,Functional,"it's great normally, but sometimes I go to sign in and over and over until it locks me out it takes me back to signing up like I'm not even in there, in other words redoing the application.

Ronda Stapleton,Functional,"It's good for keeping track of my past doctor visits and their results, weight, BP, and other things I track.

A Google user,Functional,I like that I can get updated test results right away. What I don't like is I'm reminded everytime I log in I have an unpaid doctor's bill. I called the doctor and they said no balance is due. I wish someone could remove that pesky reminder. Other than that I'm satisfied with this app.,3.0
Alex Banx,Functional,6/30/22: crashing after login. 4/22/22: there are lot of weak points to this app but my review right now is regarding the one-way messaging. would be nice if we could reply to the messages received. nobody answers their phones or the person who does answer has no idea what's going on.,3.0

Aradhana Das,Functional,"Easy to find my appointments and my ongoing health records. Only problem can not communicate with doctores. One dept can not send message to another dept.

Joan Donahue Shanosk,Functional,"I have noted it is a work in progress with EPGI, and I am even happier when I see more progress on providing me with ALL of my records and being sure my Primary Care Physician gets everything as well since EPGI is affiliated with hospital system but not completely on the patient level on the hospital/patient portal.

A Google user,Functional,Hard to direct reply to emails through this app. Thank you for your response. It works just fine on my wife's iPhone but not on my Samsung S10 plus.

James Schran,Functional,What was a great app has been slipping from a patient user standpoint. More and more it is harder to see current updates with all the historical info given.

Frontrunner,Functional,Update: I figured out finnaly why I could not log in after the most recent update. My original password had a special character at the end (As Requested ~) It was allowed for years. It was not allowed after the update. There is something wrong with the app now.

Carmen Merriam,Functional,"The app works well, is easy to use and my information has never been hacked. It is helpful to get test results prior to seeing my doctor so I can write down questions.

A Google user,Functional,"This app makes it easy to to keep track of appointments, medications - everything I used to have to plow through a stack of paper to find.

A Google user,Functional,This app is great. Having the ability to view your lab results as they arrive is great. The ability to communicate securely with your caregiver is a winner.

Ã—You can only have information from one provider. Ã—There's no desktop version.,4.0
Alfonso Rubio,Functional,"The app can be a tad intimidating but once you figure it out, it's very easy to navigate! I enjoy the notes made.. and the ability to reach out to your care providers..

scott stuart,Functional,"This app is awesome!! Easy, direct messaging/questions to my doctor or his staff when needed. I'm also able to renew my prescriptions from this app, which has my pharmacy, insurance provider, and meds all in one place. I gave it 4 stars because there's a pop-up message that does not go away.

A Google user,Functional,"Serves it's purpose for a mobile app. The only thing is when I am on the lab/test results page and click on a lab for further information and then return to the lab page showing all results, it doesn't stay where I left off on the page. instead it scrolls all the way up to the begining, which is annoying when going through older labs or if you are like me and have a lot of test results.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,I have used this app for years. I love that my main doctors office uses this so everything from there is at my fingertip when I need it. My only issues are that its so super slow. I can watch that circle go round my screen for what seems to be an eternity and if I try to back out... Yeah.. I must close out the app and start over.

A Google user,Functional,"This is handy and convenient. You can't do as many things with the app as with the web version. I haven't fully tested out the 9.14 version yet, but the basics are there.

I think that would be great! Very convienent.",4.0
Robert Kuhl,Functional,"Good & bad: very useful for messaging my doctor for appointment requests and prescription renewals. However the portion with documentation such as results is too wildly.

P.S. the sign in my on my mobile works fine but if I want to compare my test results side by side I do it on seperate screens on my computer. Otherwise the app works great. I can get my refills sent through the app in seconds",4.0
M Chad Horner,Functional,It works great!!! My only upgrade would be that you could send images. With Covid19 and a lot of Televisits it would be nice to be able to send images (example showing pitting edema) I understand major issues need to be seen but there are times I thought it could be useful.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The design of the app is meh. Not what I'd call intuitive. Much of the ""health information"" serves no practical purpose. I give it 4 stars for one glorious reason: Online, all-hours, no-fuss prescription refill requests. I don't really care about any other functions! I only wish the app showed an ""in progess"" status of the refill request (currently, it only gives an immediate confirmation message, then nothing). But I still love it. SO much better waiting to call during business hours.",4.0
Kellie Reveille,Functional,"This is an excellent app. I'm more informed with my medical information, prescriptions, diagnosis, test results, and all vitals taken each appts.

I highly recommend taking advantage of this resource if it's available.",4.0
Jeanie G Sies,Functional,This app has saved my anxiety alot! Being able to look at my entire file at our clinic helps save time and can eliminate confusion by emailing my providers and their nurses directly. No more waiting on hold or constant busy signal.,4.0
Brenda Creech,Functional,Patient at Bethany Medical in Kernersville I am always treated with the utmost respect at appointments and on the phone.

Fred Wampler,Functional,Very handy. Everything at my fingers tips. I just love this app. In the latest version an error was fixed so no work around is n now required.

WHY? All I see is my meds, allergies& diagnoses &no summary of visit. Not always able 2reply 2an email.I have 2copy & paste the prev msg &it limits what I can write in my response to Provider. I believe it's the settings used by the writer when they send or reply to a message? Overall good tool to communicate with Docs.",4.0

Meg LaRock,Functional,"Great keep in touch with primary and other specialist. You meds, see your blood work, even a journal to write what via going on. My only wish that you x-rays and carscans were uploaded. Not just the reports. So you yourself can see what they are talking about",4.0

John White,Functional,My clinic uses this application. I've found it very useful when talking with physicians and need to let them know what medications I take and I can just pull up that information in the app and show them.

George Wheeler (Wheelercub),Functional,"Pretty go so far. I like the option of contacting my doctor directly through the app, being able to choose prescriptions that I'm referencing, and streamline our communication. What I think can be improved? It would be nice to have an option to Reply to a doctor's response without having to send a whole new message. If it's already an option in the app, it certainly isn't easy to find.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app is almost perfect. It is really convenient, and easy to use. Scheduling appointments, checking your appointments, looking at personal medical records, tracking medical goals, are all so convenient. I just wish that I got billing notifications. If that gets fixed, this app is 5 stars easy.",4.0
Egg Tooth,Functional,"I have not used this app enough to be completely comfortable and educated enough as to everything it can offer but I have been really pleased with it so far. I have had a few issues but I quickly navigated to the proper location for my needs. I am extremely tech savvy and I don't find this app difficult at all but I can see room for improvement for users who may not be aware of even the basics of apps and tech. If you are a novice, don't shy away, it's a great app and it is quite easy to use.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I like this app for keeping track of my health visits and receiving notifications of upcoming appointments.

Like any other app, there could be improvements, but overall a nice way to track health records.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Surprisingly good! haven't used it long enough to give it 5 stars. but looks like complete, orderly access to my health data including results. The first time you use it, everything will have ""New"" flags. Clearing them 1 by 1 took a while, but it's only a few minutes really.",4.0
Susan Colla,Functional,Sometimes navigating to new information is difficult. Depending on where it is located going down through all the history to find new input can be frustrating. Maybe highlighting newer input would make this more convenient.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Rarely impressed with an app as I have been with this one. The ONLY thing I might improve would be creating hyperlinks to credible sources for information. For example a specific blood test results (BUN/creatinine), even with range are relatively meaningless unless the patient has knowledge of what those are. Having a link to the mayo clinic site would be very helpful!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,Great app. Only issue I've found is in checking normal ranges for test results. When you go back into the list of your results it throws you back to the beginning of the list making you scroll forward to where you were. Frustrating.,4.0
Carolyn Kissinger-Elkins,Functional,"The interface could be more user friendly especially for those of us that are older or have poor eyesight.

Improve the layout and I would give it five â",4.0
Susan â€œSusan L. Princeâ€,Functional,"This is a good app and I use it a lot to communicate with my doctors and keep up with test results and everything. I find the navigation a little confusing because it is not always easy to figure out what category to go to for the records I'm looking for, but that is because thankfully I'm somewhat healthy and don't have to use this app often. If I used it more than once every six months, I'd probably get around on it easier.",4.0
kiara,Functional,"It's easy to navigate, though at times, it's a little confusing when they say you have an update, but there is nothing new on the app",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app has been a great tool for accessing my lab results. It posts reminders of upcoming appointments and allows me to communicate with my providers. The phone support is not as stellar and occasionally I will receive a notice that there something new added to my chart, but I'm not able to find it.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,Fast and easy to use. Very well designed and loaded with info and useful features. Edit: I will add that the thing I don't like is the implementation and I can't fault the makers but my Healthcare Provider has made participation by the individual services (offices/depts) completely optional so if a Dr or a Dept doesn't feel like dealing with it they just have to opt out. As a result I have to find out about appointments by making calls/sit on hold and have zero communication with the physician.,4.0
StankyLeg McStinker,Functional,"I like the range of info available on the site. It has been broader for a longer period of time than the MyChart platform. It would be good to be able to upload documentation on this chart system. That is a glaring lack of function at this time. overall, this implementation has been one of the best I've seen in the past few years to this point. 4 stars is as high as I've rated any kind of health care portal, or any professional service portals.",4.0
Megan Yancey,Functional,"My son has had a lot of Dr. Appointments over the past 3 yrs especially with trying to diagnose his growth hormone deficiency and autism we had to do a lot of testing and evaluating and scans , X- ray's so much stuff and this app definitely helps keep everything important in one place for me with easy access to all the information we need. I love this app",4.0
Catherine Suess,Functional,"Very helpful app. Good to have centralized location for medical records. Nice to be able to access test results. Just wish app had a section providing definitions for the many acronyms & medical terms used so you can understand some of your results better. App is user friendly. Having message center is good for setting appointments, prescription refills, notes to doctor, etc. Also nice that you can pay some medical bills thru app.",4.0
AUNT KEKKIE,Functional,"Good app.. The only thing I have issue with is the tiny text area when typing a message to my doctor. There's only 1 1/2 lines of text visible as you type. It's very difficult to edit misspellings, punctuation, etc... (for us older people who actually care about those things!)",4.0
Krissy R,Functional,I really like the app. I only gave 4 stars for a few reasons one i cant print from my phone my test results or documents. And 2 there are things we can utilize for the app that i think clinics prob have to pay extra for im guessing and so we cant use. I do like the feature where i can upload documents to dr from a different dr a report or such but they dont see it unless you send them a message and let them know you added a document and then i dont think it comes across right on their side.,4.0
Vickie B,Functional,"The app is great for the most part. However, at some point there was a change and the link to add a listed appointment to your calendar (Google, Outlook) is gone. I used it all the time to keep my schedules up to date and it would be great if that was an option again.",4.0
Arlen/Cheryl Mills,Functional,"I use this every day as a kidney transplant patient. It makes it easy for me to record my vitals and track my lab work, appointments and doctor's instructions.

A Google user,Functional,"After my last visit and my last review the app is working much better. I enjoy the ability to do a lot more through the app and not so much over the phone.

Jennifer Cash,Functional,"Extremely Helpful! One problem though, when I change my personal information and save it to the app, it never changes the info when I go back to check. I have tried several times over several months. However, this app helps me know what the results my tests. Sometimes I know before she knows.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I have not navigated app since recent update. The ""4 stars are for app prior to the new version.

App does give you option to get notifications of anything new.",4.0
Carl Swick,Functional,"I really like the concept of this app but I think it could use some further development to smooth out the experience. Also, I definitely DON'T like the 1,000 character limit that is imposed on emails to my doctor. That needs changed for sure. Other than that, great app.",4.0
Michael,Functional,"***UPDATE*** Well somehow my insurance was automatically added in correctly so I'll make it four stars.

A Google user,Functional,"Easy to use! Great for having info at my fingertips and being able to communicate with my Dr's office. They are able to send reminders to me and send info and test results. Nice app. Only downfall, it seems to freeze at times. Other than that...it's pretty awesome!",4.0

Jubin John,Functional,"Free plan: Fine for tracking calories and basic macros Variety of Indian meals. Good way to start out with weight loss. Smart plan: Pretty useless. Consultation with the ""experts"" didn't help as they're weirdly condescending and uninformed. Doesn't have many micronutrient tracking options (just 4 and no vitramins) even in the paid plan. No options for making custom recipes, paid or otherwise (FitnessPal provides this for free). You can add custom meals for easier logging (only 3 of those in free plan). Not enough to actually spend 2100 for one year (got a discount). EDIT: Was able to get a refund on complaining Fitness coaching: Unresponsive and unwilling to personalize service. Couldn't even get feedback on form on a timely basis (Some claim they generally respond in 2 hours but can take more than 2 days). Flaky with phone appointments",1.0

Deepu Dillip,Functional,Absolutely horrible app to use. Would have rated less than 1 star had it been an option.

Ramya Parshi,Functional,I opted for paid service and it was horrible your diet coach always changes when you ask for refund they will not do it instead they suggest us to pause there service at the moment and continue later it is not worth paying thousands when you are not satisfied and when we ask for a refund it should be refunded I am not taking any of there services now since 6months but still I paid them ðŸ˜,1.0

INDIAN CONST CO Guj LTD â€œGUJâ€,Functional,Cheats......At the time of subscription the person on the phone explains that there you get a refund of the balance subscription plus the cost of smart scale but when you want to unsubscribe in middle they would say there is no documentation on it and thus not refundable.

Atri Bagchi,Functional,They are a bunch of money hungry wh***s. Every single useful feature makes a paid version button pop up. It's utterly disappointing to see that the basic version has literally become a gimmick. No point installing unless you have your credit card ready to go right beside you. Note to the developers - most reasonable people will pay for your premium version ONLY when they get value out of the basic version. Dropping your pants every other minute asking for money only makes users frustrated.,1.0
Sharon Singh,Functional,"Highly unethical company. They don't take their jobs or our health seriously after the payment is done. You will have to follow up for things and it takes them over a week to resolve escalations. If you ask for a refund, they will deduct a serious amount & inspite of that, you would've received absolutely 0 benefit out of the plan. I decided to go for a refund within 3 days of using the app. And its taken them more than a week to resolve it and they have unethically deducted my money! Disgusted!",1.0

Nanda Pandey,Functional,"Very disappointed with the intermittent fasting tracker recently introduced in the app. I am not able to edit the start and end time, it only considers the default valued user sets in first time login.

No notification",1.0
Sandeep Patel,Functional,This app is good for tracking food intake. But I don't advice to spend atleast a single rupee for any paid plans. It's of no use. They just keep running after you for plan upgrades and promotions & don't really give a worth of current plan with any focus of u.

Rohit Umrao,Functional,I have suggested healthifyme to one of my friend by looking at the social media. I thought it will be better place for someone who can be guided for weight loss. But unfortunately the call was more about buying the plan rather than listening the issues. They always attempt multiple calls even if you are ignoring it. Even if you see the reviews most of them is about how annoy these guys are. I was so lucky that i haven't booked any calls with them.,1.0
Vipul Agnihotri,Functional,Theives sitting behind.

The calorie tracker is the only good thing hence the one star,1.0
Subrat Gautam,Functional,"App is good in general, for people who have fixed routine. But if you happen to travel frequently, then don't subscribe to it, as their dieticians are from some lala land, who have no idea how to handle diet during travels. I took a premium service for a year and it was waste. However their follow ups are great. But, if your work doesn't allow you to have fixed routine. Then don't waste your money here.

Drishya Mohan,Functional,"The app is user-friendly and they have a great customer service. However, you could avail the same using the free version. DO NOT UPGRADE TO ANY PLANS. NOT WORTH.

No one will invest a penny without trying this app properly. Moreover if it is for Indian person then middle class will never pay more than rs 500 a month. I think Helthify should look into issues seriously to grab the marke,2.0
Bryan Tan,Functional,"Contacted support team about a year ago to suggest an activity which is quite popular. That is Golf Driving Range. But to date after uninstalling and reinstalling the app and contacted support team again, they're still giving the same reply ""Thank you for your suggestion"" but never any action. Will be uninstalling again due to the app developer not looking to improve but just for the sake of selling their fitness plans.",2.0
Sudhir Tandon,Functional,All responses are by the computer (pretend AI). If there is a tech glitch and your total calorie count is raised/ lowered all responses are messed up and wrong. Instead of losing weight I started gaining weight. For support you end up chatting with another computer and no sensible person available to correct the tech glitch,2.0
Neeva Kumawat / med,Functional,Using it since long time on and off it's no more fun in tracking anymore older versions in 2019 -20 were the best.. Too much purchase it purchase it purchase it content now really influencing bad on new people who try to use it they uninstall it instantly i recommend to at least 15-16 friends of mine only 1 person said he's still on the app all others uninstalled it due to constant pro benefits purchase adds calls and notifications I'd suggest you to bring you old version back to get more people,2.0

anjali singh,Functional,"App was good.. but now it's keep on vibrating whole mobile for like 30 -40 times a day for no reason, Only cuz of this reason I need to uninstall it.",2.0
Brighton Joel,Functional,This app's people seem to be too much money minded. There are subscription for almost every kind of feature and they are too costly. I am not saying they should not try to earn money at all but this is to the point where they can make a separate app where you can have only the free features,2.0
Alok Utsav,Functional,"Does well at tracking calories. Extremely pushy marketing tactics and nudges to upgrade. It takes anywhere between 5-10 taps to just start basic functionality and tracking. Very annoying to use, I wish they'd tone it down, I've complained to the customer service team a lot of times, but nothing. The user experience suffers because it makes it a chore to open the app to do anything.",2.0
Kamal Mehta,Functional,"This used to be an amazing App earlier. It's now loaded with pop-ups and marketing material, even if you are a paid user. I have a smart plan, yet, got to navigate through multiple pop-ups before getting to the basic need of tracking. The user experience has deteriorated multiple folds in the recent times. There are many ways to upsell, killing the user experience is not of them. I've lost interest in tracking even though have paid for it. It's sad how poor strategy kills a beautiful product!!",2.0
Aly,Functional,"I didn't like it. I'm rating it 2 stars because it won't even let me delete my account. I have to receive a code that never sends. I had to contact customer support, and after I stated that I simply want to delete my account, they responded with ""May I ask what are your fitness goals?""!? They said they would transfer me to someone else, and simply never responded again. They actually never read my last message. Now this app has access to my Google account and has done nothing but waste my time.",2.0
Ravi Teja,Functional,"Not the best app. Using the calorie tracker on the free account is better than buying a premium plan to track micronutrients. It shows only iron, magnesiolum, cholestrol and zinc. Doesn't show any other minerals and 0 vitamins. A waste of money if you want to track micros.",2.0
Justin John,Functional,It was good until they became hungry for money for calorie counting too. I am already paying for macronutrient calculation. From 4 to 2 star.,2.0
GLEN Colaco,Functional,Recently from past month smart scale is not working as expected it does not display the BMI data on the app it just show your weight!,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Tracking experience is good ,but every single time when I have to make an entry ,there are pop ups to buy premium or a diet or something or the other . It is very irritating,if I want to incorporate any of the suggestions , I would take it on my own . Looking for more options ,after that will uninstall .the suggestions are very annoying",2.0
Akshat Birla,Functional,Very pushy commercial app. Almost everything is paid and even the basic functionality of tracking calorie constituents is under a pay wall. It's a shame that they have created a very useful app but with a very commercial mindset and not with a user experience mind set. Definitely keep the paid options but don't hardsell these so much that people just decide to leave. Many of the free customers who are not ready at the moment may wnat to use your paid features at some point. Don't drive them away,2.0
Nagalakshmi K,Functional,"The step counter increases for 1000 steps then, it starts to go down by 100 - 500 steps and again starts to count from there until it reaches 1000 and again it decreases. I am facing this for the past one and half months. I tried calling the team, they assured it will get resolved.. but it's still the same. I would request the technical team to look into and help us to use the app in a smooth way. Thanks!!!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Just been under a day and it doesn't sync well to Google Fit, the troubleshooting options dont work. Can't give feedback. You need to switch off reminders otherwise its just a bombardment of notifications. You enter info once and then there's a constant ""7 day free trial"" reminder that you cant switch off. All this and its not been 24 hours. The good thing is the food database that's relevant to folks in India. Will update this review after a week of using it under the basic free plan.",2.0
Unnikrishnan G,Functional,Using a paid version now. It used to show a nice graph of the weight loss over the entire goal period. Now is shows only the tail end of the graph. Earlier versions used to revise your daily calorie intake if you were expending more calories. Currently the calorie intake is fixed. This leaves you short of calories on days that you work out more. Support team has asked me to respond with screenshot in the in app chat. That function doesn't work ðŸ˜ž and shows no images on the device,2.0
Rachna Sharma,Functional,"Even if I have logged food items before, it fails to show up on other days. This is something I struggle with daily. My protein shake from a particular brand is logged daily by me. But it does not show up. Some times I just out some other protein and log it. And same for some other food items. And why can't this be solved? I even have pro membership right now.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,Really disappointed with the unhelpful customer service. I was charged for the second month automatically when I didn't want to renew. I only use it to track my diet and don't use the smart plan. I got it by using the coupon code from CRED. They take mandatory sign in for Google and then automatically charged me for the second month without any authorization request. And now they tell me their system doesn't have the ability of refunds. This means I get to suffer for a shortfall in their system.,2.0
Divyanshu Tiwari,Functional,"I had created an account years ago and when I reinstalled the app now, I can't seem to find the goal changer? I want to check on what basis the calorie requirements are targeted and change them if they are not right. But I am not able to find the option to do so. UI is difficult to navigate for me. I would suggest that you create a separate app for calorie counting where you only keep the relevant features. I don't want a coach or workout routine. I simply want to track my calories.",2.0
Abhivyakti Srivastava,Functional,"Great app, one of the best calorie counters for an Indian user, but the only major issue that i face is the user interface is horrible. Its overwhelming, loaded with information one doesn't necessarily need right in their faces. I liked the layout of the previous version, where it only showed the calorie counter, steps etc on its main page. Please work on your user interface and clear the clutter!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I just downloaded this for their Indian food log. Their repeated reminders saying. ""Congratulations, you've got a free trial for a week"" pop up is irritating now. That trial is just permission for their trainers to push for the premium version, not actually a trial. Great app and if I can stop the pop-ups entirely, I'd raise it to 4 stars. Till then, it stays at 2",2.0
Ab,Functional,"Very messy app for what should be a straightforward process from a good database. For instance, selecting yesterday's food just default enters the same quantity and you have to go back in and edit it!! Also kinda annoying that I can't just enter my own custom calories and macros for a particular food that is unavailable, and instead have to create new food by choosing from the existing database. Easier to use it as a reference and track on Google sheets or Excel.",2.0
Ajita Sharma,Functional,"I love this app but recently have encountered certain challenges, here they are .. * I can't add the food items that I have taken. * I can't filter out my booked sessions in studio, if I tap ""back"" button to get back to the list it shows me the list from very 1st session. * UX wise I struggle to access certain options. Like if I have to browse certain recipe, I get confused and keep on searching to find this option. *The loading time is too much.",2.0
Tukesh Ranjan,Functional,"The overall healthilyme services are fine but the app itself needs improvements (it's very frustrating to face these issues as a customer) - One can't see the option of booking a counselling session at one's convenience, even though one has subscribed for healthifyme sense. There is just a banner which isn't available all the time. - There is no option of browsing/selecting multiple services, which one wants to use. e.g. as a premium subscriber of a health plan, I also want to use Ria services",2.0
Sutapa Mishra,Functional,1. Even if requested to put on dnd one still gets call and inapp notification for plan purchase which is very annoying. 2. Bugs - the back button in moat of the screens (say sleep) doesn't work and results in minimising of app. You have to close the app and the start again to traverse to other screens. 3. If after setting up a weight reminder it never buzz for me. Seems testing team needs to focus a little more.,2.0
Sagar Reddy,Functional,"Need to provide flexible diet options, keto etc. Option to customise macros would be useful. Option to have reminders during our own eating windows rather than traditional eating windows. The recipes need a lot of clean up as there are duplicates and it is confusing. Option to add our own food item with its nutritional information would be useful not just building a recipe with your ingredients.",2.0
Apoorva Ashu,Functional,"Good for tracking calories but really pushy with all the notifcations and the UI experience is also not good with so much clutter even things like basic calorie tracking becomes a task. Also, there's no option to customise your macros and it's a dealbraker for me and must be for most people I guess. Have not tried the expert plan or the sorts do cannot comment on that. Overall bad experience, app needs to imporve a lot.",2.0
Abhik D.,Functional,"Was working fine untill I deleted my account to start afresh (had not opened for some months because of exams). Now when I fire up the app it opens the starting screen (where you are asked why you are visiting healthify) and just freezes. After 15s or so it just crashes. I've tried everything I possibly could : clear cache, force stop, uninstall, reinstall but the problem is persistent. Maybe you can guide me?",2.0
Aliza Aslam,Functional,It was an ok experience. I bought the diet plan only as I was not interested in fitness plan. 1) they still keep advertising and urging you to keep buying the more expensive one or the other plans. 2)the diet coach has abysmal part in the diet and just keeps messaging about promotions. I would recommend people to buy the tracker only as thats the only remotely useful thing. These have helped me loose weight and they would help anyone out so thats the only part I would recommend.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,I like the old versions. The new updates underestimates calories in most food items. There are often great disparities between the weight and calories written on sachet and this app. Please fix these things in next update. And please give suggestions regarding cholesterol and other micronutrient intake. Otherwise you guys are doing a great job.,2.0
Prithvi Raj Deshmukh,Functional,"Good to count calories. Very pushy ads. Don't you guys sync the calorie intake with Google Fit? Right the data sync appears to be one way - from Google fit to HealthifyMe. It should be a two way data sync. Also don't get too pushy to sell premium features to everyone, i don't use it but after using the free version for quite some time recommended this to one my relatives who bought a premium membership. So please be mindful of selling in a subtle manner.",2.0
avinash verma,Functional,"Good for tracking but the UX is horrible. It's so confusing to do anything, more than half of options are an effort to convert the user to a paid plan. While I appreciate the free features, it's not easy at all to use the app unless you have a subscription.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"there is some problem in the app. yesterday my calorie count for the day was different and now today when i am seeing the data for the previous day it is showing some different figure. Also after setting the targets the budget for calories i got should be same for all days but it keeps on changing, sometimes 2 or 3 times a day. please look into these issues.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,HealthifyMe was pretty good initially. Well made with proper functionality. Some good motivational stories as well. Coaches did not honor the appointment twice which was a big put off since I had to wake at 6am for both. Another issue was that the calorie count changed from 1500 to 2050 to 1400 to 2220 in a span of two days. Will be skipping this app.,2.0
Nikhil Yadav,Functional,"This app sets random alarm in my pixel. And when the alarm time comes, then it sets another alarm. I've checked my clock app and I've researched on the internet that some apps are causing this issue on pixels. Pausing or force closing the app removes the alarm and the alarm does not show in the lockscreen anymore.",2.0
Divyanshu Chavhan,Functional,Use to be much better earlier. I just want to log food intake and nothing else. But the app constantly takes to the screen where it assigns a dietician and all other paid or trial plans. There is no way getting around. Quite irritating at some times.,2.0
raja sekhar,Functional,"Not really a great experience... The smart plan which includes a work out regime based on the users preferences is completely lopsided. For example, I only get excercises on Core and lower body on the automatic recommendations page and not a balanced set of work outs involving all body parts. Goes on to prove that it's smart plan is indeed not so smart. Despite adding weights as my preference, I don't get any workouts involving weights which is another irony.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,I had to delete this app after a few days of use due to an unnecessarily complicated interface. It got to a ridiculous point where any time I opened it it had a different starting page. Also the constant full screen reminders to purchase a full version were annoying.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Too many pop-ups, and the interface isn't smooth even for someone who has been using similar apps. What I'm looking for when I key in the foods apart from watching what I eat is to have a daily summary of the plusses and minuses- it seemed here the feature is automatically affected on the basal metabolic rate, it's ok for me as I kinda get it ; but imagine those who are not. The serving portion should also be varied- not everyone in the world uses Katori, you know. Pedometer not working.",2.0
apmapple,Functional,"OLD HABITS DIE HARD This app used to give a lot of in app pop ups which they removed due to 1*s stating pop ups as the reason. I also changed my rating from 1* to 4* But now I'm changing it back to 2* because, They're subtly bringing those pop ups back. Here & there, you can see the pop ups which can't be muted. Some times a video, about that new stupid scale or classic buy premium 1000% discount. Pls Stop!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"The UI is incoherent. Chatbot appears all of sudden.

Finally uninstalled the app.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I used this app a year ago and it helped me a lot with my tracking of calorie intake, workouts and weight loss.

chakshina gupta,Functional,"The app is the only thing they have invested, tracking meals is fine but taking a coach is pathetic experience here. They keep changing the coaches or the coaches keep leaving on their own. Previous one doesn't bother to give the client history to new ones and new one doesn't bother to find out also. They charge huge and coaches are just some youngsters with minimal knowledge of diet and issues. No experienced dieticians.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,The app is buggy. While selecting food items for my diet as soon as I plugged in the charger to charge my phone the app undid all my selections and jumped on the previous page. I had to select all the items again. It wasted a lot of my time and energy.,2.0
Mohit Chandak,Functional,"There is no easy way to track calories. I simply need a two click workflow to track my calories, I cant do that by simply scanning a barcode. Even to add custom food I have to always search a food and I am not able to add foods with barcode. And stop pushing so much for pro plan. Literally every first accessible thing in app is workflow to purachse pro plan You've failed in UX for a simple calorie counter usecase",2.0
Mayank Kumar,Functional,I found this app really helpful in matter of calorie counting of Indian food. I can't get the info of all my food nutrients unless I opt for an premium plan which cost 400/- a month of or nearly 2000/- a year. This amount is ok I want all the premium feature but for just full food tracking this amount is too much. Please introduce a cheaper plan with only food insights. I would definitely subscribe for that planðŸ™‚,2.0
Athul C. Arun,Functional,"There are too much advertisement inside the app about features of the app itself and about further upgrade options that...

At first i was delighted because every food is there in this. but using this app made me gain weight cz it kept reminding me about food (to enter) and the calories shown are very less compared to actual calories. i verified that with packet products per gram and entire packet. they want us to buy their coaching. very bad experience. examples - nescafe coffee sachet, cup noodles, snickers chocolate",2.0

It doesn't account for different types of cuisines very well (didn't say not at all) or the variety one has in fruits and vegetables in one region itself. And that matters quite a lot.

Harikrishnan R,Functional,They don't offer a trial period. Took a chance and bought a plan but now regret doing so as it doesn't suit my needs.

A Google user,Functional,There is some bug with the app it deletes all the favourite contacts from my call log. Do fix. Previous versions had a simple suggestive diet which didnt come with the cost of premium membership. Wish you could bring that back.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,I did loved this app and would have given 5 stars but I'm very disappointed that it doesn't support to scan barcode on any food products. It does can snap pics of foods but sometimes it's not that accurate. Barcode scanner are more accurate. Still fine.,2.0
Nikhil Thomas,Functional,"Honest opinion-. This thing was good and I was a regular user of their premium plan. But the amount of calls you get drove me nuts, both from the gym coach and diet coach. If I want a consultation I will book the slot right. Beginning it was great, but then they irritated me with calls without me asking for any. Every meeting I attend I get their calls. Uninstalled the moment my one year plan expired.",2.0

Sudhir Tandon,Functional,All responses are by the computer (pretend AI). If there is a tech glitch and your total calorie count is raised/ lowered all responses are messed up and wrong. Instead of losing weight I started gaining weight. For support you end up chatting with another computer and no sensible person available to correct the tech glitch,2.0
Adviti Dhatrak,Functional,The tracking is not seamless at all. No matter how many times I refresh it. It takes very long to update the steps. Also the new feature of clicking pics for tracking is very confusing and long.,2.0
Bryan Tan,Functional,"Contacted support team about a year ago to suggest an activity which is quite popular. That is Golf Driving Range. But to date after uninstalling and reinstalling the app and contacted support team again, they're still giving the same reply ""Thank you for your suggestion"" but never any action. Will be uninstalling again due to the app developer not looking to improve but just for the sake of selling their fitness plans.",2.0
Neeva Kumawat / med,Functional,Using it since long time on and off it's no more fun in tracking anymore older versions in 2019 -20 were the best.. Too much purchase it purchase it purchase it content now really influencing bad on new people who try to use it they uninstall it instantly i recommend to at least 15-16 friends of mine only 1 person said he's still on the app all others uninstalled it due to constant pro benefits purchase adds calls and notifications I'd suggest you to bring you old version back to get more people,2.0
Jose Mario Paul,Functional,Google Fit data (steps and calories) are not syncing anymore. Tried disconnecting and reconnecting the Fit account multiple times but to no avail,2.0
Amrit Pal,Functional,it seems better. The missing part is that the trial period is only for three days. it should be at least one month as if one is able to use this app continuosly for 21 days only then he will use it forever. second there is no monthly plans for subscription which is pathetic. No one will invest a penny without trying this app properly. Moreover if it is for Indian person then middle class will never pay more than rs 500 a month. I think Helthify should look into issues seriously to grab the marke,2.0
Mihir Athale,Functional,I've used the app few year back. It was much better. Now everything is behind the subscription model. A simple plan change to intermittent fasting is behind a subscription model with most of useless things I do not need. You guys can definitely think of one time payment option for certain small features where people really don't require over the top features. Just tracking is enough.,2.0
Somanahalli Raju,Functional,It's a great app for tracking your food habits. But what's the annoying part is the marketing gimmicks and pushouts to sell out their premium plans. Let the customer decide what he wants . There are numerous calls and messages which is really very disturbing and annoying. The app only guides but finally the work has to be done by an individual so let the person decide what he wants .,2.0

More than a month passed by., When things didn't work out for me, they are reluctant for refund also. Whereas it was clearly mentioned, refund will be given if we are not satisfied. But, getting money back is highly impossible. If you fell on this well, you cannot come out, your money is also gone. Highly insecured in terms of money.",2.0
Ravi Teja,Functional,"Not the best app. Using the calorie tracker on the free account is better than buying a premium plan to track micronutrients.

Mohita Mudaliar,Functional,"I don't know what's wrong with the app. Whenever I click on need help button.. it takes me to a blank page and a msg pops up saying ""something went wrong"" I was doing so to take a plan from your app but don't think so I should proceed now cuz neither the toll free number works nor the app!",2.0
Aly,Functional,"I didn't like it. I'm rating it 2 stars because it won't even let me delete my account. I have to receive a code that never sends. I had to contact customer support, and after I stated that I simply want to delete my account, they responded with ""May I ask what are your fitness goals?""!? They said they would transfer me to someone else, and simply never responded again. They actually never read my last message.

Varsha M,Functional,"Food tracking and remainders are pretty good. They lack in communication when I tried scheduling a call with dietician.

They do offer many diet plans which might be efficient but without proper guidance provided, customers cannot simply buy a plan. Hope they would improve on customer service.",2.0
Deepti Malvadkar,Functional,The step calorie burnt showing very wrong information. 740 steps showing 919 cal burnt. It cannot be more than 30-40cal burnt for such small movement. Else we will not need any movement and just burn more calories than we walk. How can calories burnt be more than steps Walked? Misleading app. Not reliable data. Lost confidence in other measurements too on this app after this. Don't recommend this app for health measurements.,2.0
Mohit Chandak,Functional,"There is no easy way to track calories. I simply need a two click workflow to track my calories, I cant do that by simply scanning a barcode. Even to add custom food I have to always search a food and I am not able to add foods with barcode. And stop pushing so much for pro plan. Literally every first accessible thing in app is workflow to purachse pro plan You've failed in UX for a simple calorie counter usecase",2.0

The person didn't call at the selected time nor did inform me beforehand about the delay, which is a basic courtesy. What a waste of time!

jiya choudhary,Functional,"So, I have taken the smart plan for a year and the customization they provided there is repetetive, infact it was same for all the days.I have no choice but to mention that in reviews and twitter that the company does not follow fair policies. What they promise to deliver they don't after getting paid and exploiting its own customers. I only used for 6 days and they are charging 800 for 6 days is a very hefty cancellation fees without even delivering anything promised before the billing.",2.0

A Google user,Functional,"I am not sure if this is a bug, but why in the hell does this enable the alarm icon on my phone, on the top right status bar? Sure, you can send alerts and notifications for all things you do with the app, but altering the phone's functionality with alarm icon is seriously not recommended! All that does is confuse the user as to why the alarm icon appears when they have not set any alarm in any of the apps they use!!",3.0
Revati Ramesan,Functional,"I have paid for the app and I will tell you my honest experience. The dashboard is so clouded with promotions of the photo snap tracker, the messages from coaches, the healthify store, I just get overwhelmed.

The plan I have taken, Smart AI plan, is really great and helpful. Even the gym exercises and food items mentioned are really helpful.",3.0
Shriharsha KL,Functional,"The ""smart"" plan doesn't really include anything that's not already available for free online, like basic meals with recipes and calorie information, calorie counting and logging, etc. I didn't find it helpful. It just seems like a gimmick to get people to upgrade to a more expensive plan.",3.0
Tara Thomas,Functional,"There is so much hype around this app but using it even just to track meals is painful. For one, I can't enter the exact amount of Calories even if they are clearly mentioned on the product I'm eating. Also, saving a new meal backfires as every single ingredient in it is listed out when I add it to my daily plan, what's the point of saving it as a single new meal then? Constant upsell ads without a smooth freemium experience. Disappointing.",3.0
Aman Tomar,Functional,The app works great......I just use it to count my calories and macros and have been using the app for a long time now. But since the last update the insight section has been glitching. Even after i delete or modify a meal the insight section would remove those foods from its calculations and instead would just just add the new added meals and give the total calories. This very annoying i would like for it to resolve as soon as possible. Thanks,3.0
Mohit Bhadra,Functional,"Great work by the team but app needs improvements. If you go back from an active workout or kill the app by mistake , it does doesn't count the calories you burnt till that point. If you go back on exercise number 20 out of 25 and start again from 21 , it only counts the last 5 i.e only that session. This is very frustrating. Please make it so that it registers all sets/reps separately",3.0
Manasi Shrotriya,Functional,"I'm having some issues with the app. The main screen shows the exact amount of calories consumed today, that is, 856, but the insights are showing 1005 no matter what.

Kajal Karn,Functional,"Over all a good app. But there are some flaws in the diet plan. Once you change preferences it still suggest the same cuisines.

It's a paid feature, I expect it to work better than this.",3.0
Ranjan Kumar Hasda,Functional,I don't why when connecting with Google Fit it ask permission for location and fitness activity. All it has to do is exchange data from Google Fit that's it.,3.0
Sushma R Huddar,Functional,The app is good for Strength training. But trust me Strength training kind of induces some anxiety...so i switched to yoga. The app features are pathetic for yoga. One has to switch between YouTube and healthifyme app and wait for the ads on YouTube to get over. This is not a good sign for a peaceful yoga practice. Also one has to chase the nutritionist repeatedly to get information on diet ! Not much comes out of them voluntarily! They copy paste replies from chatgpt ! Nothing else,3.0
Divyendu R,Functional,"It's a great app for fitness enthusiasts. Well trained coaches and dietitians to enhance one's physical and mental health. To the developers: The only issue I have is the limitation of fitness watch/bands. Google fit is highly inaccurate which is highly used for devices not mentioned in the list. Kindly add apps like ZEPP/MI or any others smartwatch and fitness band, so that there is accurate tracking of steps, calorie burnt, fitness activities.",3.0
Amey Hindlekar,Functional,"Could have been better with a plant based option in dietary preferences. Also, wanting to maintain the current weight based is not even an option.

Jumana Abdul Majeed,Functional,"Poor customer service. Have to explain the entire story to each new customer care representative that speaks to you for a single issue And poor experience with fitness trainers.

Karan Karnik,Functional,"The best app out there for calorie tracking. The food database is huge and I hardly ever came across anything that wasn't available to track. What annoys me, however, is the constant notifications. They constantly try to push you to purchase the paid plans. As someone who is just looking for basic self-tracking, it's very irritating to constantly swipe away the notifications to purchase the paid plan.",3.0
The Unknown,Functional,Free plan does not show a progress against goals as a summary. You have to go one day at a time. Also calorie estimates feels very very low. My daily intake even without restriction comes to less than 1400. So I am over estimating everything I put there to be more realistic .,3.0
Ginisha Goel,Functional,Hi Team. Thanks for the response. But the app provides for manually setting up 'step goal' and not the actual walked steps. Please provide an update with the same.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"As a product manager, I was very impressed with the idea of integrating professional coaching into the app and have it to compliment the tracking and the planning. The reason why I stopped using it was, there are just too many features, and the e app does not allow you to create custom dishes where you add your own nutrients instead, it ask you to suggest it to the developer. Again, great concept and best of luck!",3.0
Umrao Krishna Singh,Functional,"Used to love the app. But now it is way too agressive in promoting the premium version. It would be fine if there was just one prompt every time I login or one banner at one screen as it was earlier. But now it's very aggressive, even full screen promotion! Multiple of those in succession! Just makes my experience horrible, I might just shift to some other app.",3.0
K. P,Functional,"Every single time I open the app, I receive a notification that I have won a 7 day free trial which is obviously a method to encourage customers to purchase the trial. I get it. The company needs money. But I've already refused this feature over ten times and it's still popping up. Other than that, the app is good for those who want to record local food options. That's it but the ad experience was too intrusive for my taste. It could have been 4 stars due to the ease of use and clean UI.",3.0
Simran Choudhary,Functional,"I don't know why but this app automatically sets alarm in my phone which doesn't ring but is postponed to few hours later. It's a bit annoying to see an alarm set when I didn't set it. I had used this app before but past a year or so this problem is there so I uninstalled (1 year ago i think). After that, there are no unnecessary alarms. Today I saw this app again in store thought the problem have been solved but no. It would be good if you people could fix this. It's a very good app.",3.0
Richa Tyagi,Functional,App is really good in general but I kept on getting reminders on getting a paid version and now when I paid for smart plan version there is no special change. But they way they advertise that I will get personalised workout plan etc is not even true. Its as good as free version of any excercise app. I really liked the free version of app but now I just feel cheated and dont feel like using it.,3.0
Sumithra Krishnan,Functional,"It's a good app to count calories and keep it in check.The one problem I have with the app is that it doesn't allow me to track my next day's meal in advance. I am sure there would be a lot of people like me here, who plan their next day's main meals in advance. It becomes quite irritating when we don't have such a flexibility- to check the calories of our planned diet for the next day in advance. Enabling the option would also help in reducing food wastage.",3.0
Sungmin Aegyo,Functional,"Dear developer, this app is good. It has a lot of database for Malaysian food compared to other calorie counter apps. I also like the fact that its easy to change the serving size to metric system, instead of just one vague serving. I want to suggest something. Please make it easier for me to put the weight of food I'm eating. Instead of having problem with scrolling down the numbers and adding up to complete the weight of food I'm eating. Eg: 122 grams ect.",3.0
Nawal Singal,Functional,Much improvements needed. Sync with Samsung watch except step count doesn't work even with health connect/ gogle fit. Optional meals except fixed 5 should be there like morning tea or optional random snack. You have to cram every thing in one meal. Good but can be way more better. Stick to free one as premium is no better. App is just a vague calorie counter. Suggestions are not upto the mark.,3.0
Sailee Angane,Functional,"This app is too good to track all my intakes. The only problem I found is that if I want to add a new food item I need add the ingredients of it.

A Google user,Functional,"I downloaded this app because it has a list of Indian foods which i couldn't find on my other app. But I've noticed features that are not in app that i wish were there and it's become a bit annoying. 1.

It doesn't let me set how fast i want to lose wt. The only opt available is easy. Rest are not recommended so one can't even choose them",3.0
Gaurav Singh,Functional,"I am on a pro program and I am using it for past 1 year. Current update of adding time with meal tracker is annoying. I don't add everytime I just finish a meal. Also the minute dial is waste. Scrolling to go back 30 min is hectic. As a design also, time dial is one more step that reduces tracking. As a user I have two options : 1. Don't care about time, just click done. But time is good asset just minute dial is too hectic interface.(Change is to input or have shortcut of 15 minute)",3.0
Shobha Rao,Functional,"I installed this app with great expectations, and it actually delivered. I was happy to use it to track my food and water intake. But this app drains my battery very fast.

If it was only for water, it would be better. I had to unfirtunately take the decision to uninstall the app.",3.0
Durgesh Kshirsagar,Functional,"Too many notifications. App gives continuous notifications and recommendations which is quite annoying. Before even using it for once they try to promote premium membership. So much bloatware content in app which draws your focus. I think they must cut down app in different sections and stop recommending lot of unnecessary things. Else app has a good potential to excel. The amount of time, efforts and funds they used for marketing can be used to polish and simplify the app.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,App is great. It works really fine n all features are great. But y do healthify associates keep calling and bug us ??? I dont want a dietician. I just want an app to keep track of food i m eating. Nothing more. Everyday i get 2 to 3 calls. I m seriously irritated to the extent that i want to uninstall the app. Thats y minus 2 stars.

A Google user,Functional,"The food database for Indian foods seems good. However, when I open this app, music playing in background just gets paused.

A Google user,Functional,"The app is very helpful is maintaining a fit life by helping you track your foods and exercises. You can set your fitness goals and it will give you the course to achieving it. I myself have benefited from this app. The problem that I have with the app is that the search results for the food are very slow to load. The fact that you have to track your foods throughout the day, calls for fast search results. Otherwise the task becomes time consuming. That is why the 3-stars.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The best thing and the only good thing about this app is that it has a vast catalogue of Indian food. So, if you need a way to track your daily calorie intake to a reasonable accuracy, this is a really good app. Everything else about this app I find quite annoying and useless.

Saravanan Punniyakotti,Functional,"Hi, this app looks good. But the home page too much crowded. The main icons (food tracker , workout routine) are tiny and discover is half the screen.

Niladri Das,Functional,"I find the calorie tracker and weight tracker to be quite efficient, except that the calorie tracker doesn't have net-tracking, and that most of the trackers only have either the metric scale or cm only (no inches). No imperial scale either. The most annoying thing to me is their ""marketing strategy"". Unlike Strava or Runstatic, they are heavily focused on agressively incentivised approach, conducting raffles to reward their users with materials. I personally find that a very greedy approach.",3.0
Al zain,Functional,"It's a good app as far as I observed but the only problem is 95 Percent of the options are paid and only you can access those options when you are paying ..

But without a trial I don't think so it's a good idea to gor for premium service.",3.0
Aditya Modak,Functional,"Nice app. Wide variety to track calories. However, please stop pushing for notifications and pitching for taking diet plans.

Avani Kamble,Functional,It's kind of annoying when the plan and advertises keep popping. If someone wants to they will approach a you can surely plan it for them.... they have downloaded app...which means they might as well think about it.

Sometimes Google fit doesn't sync the data all the workout and burnt cal doesn't get tracked. Its a hassle.",3.0
James,Functional,"I've tried 6 of the top rated calorie counting apps. This one is not the worst but it is annoyingly bloated. I don't want to talk to a coach every time I launch the app. I just want to track my meals without being nagged to upgrade. When I skip the chat with a coach, the app sometimes crashes. For me there's too much BS, I prefer a no-frills app like ""fatsecret"" , which has a premium option but doesn't harrass the user constantly.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"while i love healthifyme for this easy to use interface and huge database, there are 2 prime issues i face with this app. firstly if i have not set a weight loss goal, then the daily calorie intake it shows is very high. ideally it should be linked to my BMR and the activities done. however it shows almost 1.5 times of that. secondly the calories of food doesn't match with other apps. it is always lower in this which might lead to a wrong intake as i am undercalculating my calories.",3.0
Abhinand Nair,Functional,"Everything is good. If u want to use it for free.. you can do that too, for counting calories of what you eat, exercise, etc..

A Google user,Functional,Best out there. Really great on the food database too. It would be much better to have few improvements like 1. Showing the insight and each nutriton limit firsthand instead going through multiple pages. 2. Ability to adjust the nutrition limit in case we are following a specific kind of diet where carb should be much less in daily food intake,3.0
Umesh Mokal,Functional,"I'm using this app since last week and following what it is suggesting. But, tracking each day's meal and searching for the food items is little cumbersome.

Unable to adjust your macros budget per day as the protein, carbs, fats, fiber percentages are fixed. Weight log cannot be edited for previous days so if you forget to log it on a certain day, you can never go back unless you change your phone's date which then messes up syncing with your Fitbit app. Caution that the app recommends daily calorie intake of 1,200 which can be too low.",3.0
Pradeep Paladi,Functional,"I think there's a bug in the latest version of the app. Precisely, in the workout plan, after a workout gets completed, for the next workout I'm not seeing any video but i can hear the sound. I'm facing this issue after to the new version. Can you please check Otherwise, everything is worth!",3.0
AAIEL VORA,Functional,"All they are hungry for is......Money,money and money almost everything here on this app is paid you get just 1 or 2 chances to use them,the calorie counter tells feed ourselves more till we reach our budget but sometimes it's good to save something for later. The workouts are mostly paid. The most great thing here is just the calorie counter when we eat food.",3.0
MUKESH GURU,Functional,After using 12 long months as a premium user and as well as a pro user I could say that it's a good app if you do your part honestly and persistently. But the app still some improvements like the work out traking and in diet plan also there should be menu to view how many days one has followed the plans like in the form of graphs it would be very useful. And as always the steps syncing has always been the problem.,3.0
Nidhin P Koshy,Functional,"It was one of my best companion for weight loss but now its just gone worse. When I search for a food item, it just says slow or no internet connection and below saying searching. I should be very lucky to get any result from the search. Devs please look into it and fix it.. its ruining the whole experience.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,The app is good with just the food logging part. There should be an option where we can modify the calorie level set by the app. Set our own personal goals with respect to the diet we follow. There are also many more smart watches that this app doesn't support.,3.0
Ronit Srivastava,Functional,A lot of foods available to count calories from. Also tells nutrients. Perfect in all sense. Just a problem that the calories I burnt shows much amount more in my watch despite syncing it. Different exercises like running may have lesser step count but greater number of calories. So I think just like it takes my step count it should take my calories too.,3.0
Pragya Jha,Functional,I loved this app when it is about tracking food. But at the same timw it is miserable when I wabt to keep a track of drinking water. The app will never remind you about it. No one can actually keep watching phone as if the app may give notification like beep.... Drink water. It must have a sound so that a person actually gets a reminder to drink water. Hoping the developer team will take this suggestion if they really want to improve.,3.0
Huma Tahir,Functional,I have the HealthifySmart plan. Sometimes the total calories in the diet plan are within specified limits but the individual nutrients are in red zone. I tried to get over this problem by changing the quantity of the dish that I chose but it doesn't allow that. I have to change the entire food choice which I don't want to do.,3.0
Anubhooti Shrivastava,Functional,"Service is nice however there are some things which used to get critical for a person. Basically call ups in every week is okay but I think if a person is purchasing your plan he or she will take initiative to ask if there is any difficulty. Further plans are good and easy .They must consider some things further, innovating routine is okay but full innovation is not possible. plans are too costly. All over it is good app . But not compatible for persons who have busy routine.",3.0
Sindhuja Vijayaraghavan,Functional,"This is by far the best app to track calories and macros on an Indian diet, despite its constant ads and notifications. I would love it if there is a way to enter custom values eith calories and/or macros breakdown, since there are now takeaway places who provide their own calorie labels. Or a feature to scan them will also be nice.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Very pushy app. Too many pop ups that sell different plans. I have used similar apps in the past, none is as pushy as this one. The only reason I'm still using this one is that it's Indianized. The UI isn't the best, nor is it the worst. Doesn't sync with mi band. Doesn't allow you to edit step data, they should as sometimes the band's can be inaccurate.",3.0
Medha Sharma,Functional,"Unable to save reminder, Tried to save drinking water reminders for every hours. it shows the changes done, but after reopening app it goes to default setting to remind only thrice on tuesdays.

Not sure where to raise issue for 'Raise an issue' glitch..lol ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",3.0
Ann Jacob,Functional,"We cannot customise the default water intake. It is always 250 and this makes it difficult to track water intake. Everyone does not drink 250ml in one go every time and we cannot change the intake to 0.5 or 0.75 glasses either. Also, There is no integrated step counter. Hence, I end up downloading two more apps, one to track water intake accurately and another to track steps. Would be really helpful if this was all integrated in Healthify itself.",3.0
ASLESH KUMAR MOHAPATRA,Functional,"Reduce In-App Advertisements: The app aggressively promotes its premium services, bombarding users with multiple push notifications and banner ads as soon as they open the app. This intrusive advertising approach hinders the overall user experience, especially for those who only require the basic features for everyday tracking. It would be beneficial if the app developers could tone down the frequency of these push ads.",3.0

Ramya Singh,Functional,"I don't know what actually happened with this app... Previously it was working good but after recent update, sometimes it doesn't count calories.. example if I'm walking and at 2000 steps if it's showing 200calories burnt so even after walking 5000 steps it'll show the same 200 calories burnt. I tried refreshing it, restarting app, even my phone.. but it doesn't work.",3.0

Varun Joshi,Functional,"I have been using this app intermittently for over a year now. Suddenly they removed the free workouts with the AI coach (Ria) plan & drastically increased the other plans costs. Imagine, if one has no equipment and is also not in a state to invest either in equipment or choose a virtual coach based plan that costs you â‚¹1200+ a month. It is very disappointing if you think that, that customer base shouldn't be with your app. Anyways, uninstalling you folks - atleast that is free (lol)",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"App's functionality is awesome. Food database includes all type food. And also free version is enough for beginners. I used it for 15 days.

Hinaxi Patel,Functional,The app's really nice till it was running smooth but since couple of weeks it keeps crashing all the time and it doesn't let me open or do anything. 1-2 sec. and it gets crashed. Please suggest. I also have tried reinstalling but the the same issue persist.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,Good for tracking daily intakes. AI powered assistant is a good start. very nice concept and could be useful if the app was not so buggy. Too many functional issues with the app. diet plan is repetitive. only 2-3 options which keep rotating even on disliking. selected north Indian food but keeps showing south indian sambhar uttpam dosa. Not worth giving thousand bucks for such service.,3.0
Sriram Raja,Functional,"The onboarding plan asks for what you want to do, that's great. I choose calorie tracker and that is hidden in other trackers after I complete the sign up. It is hard to understand where to track what you ate.",3.0
Shashank Naidu,Functional,The calorie tracker is too good for Indian diets as everything about available Indian options is there. The only problem is that too much stress is given on buying a paid subscription. Most of the vital functions are locked. The app has a huge potential and can find different approach in revenue generation other than pestering users to shell out money.,3.0
Sankalp Rahi,Functional,"Been using the app since more than a 1 month. The healthifyme step counter is a hoax. It keeps its own step count irrespective of the source (mifit/googlefit). Moreover, it keeps changing the step count as well as the calories burnt. The calorie counter is useful but I doubt it's accuracy too. Long story short, basics of app are ok. But the calorie burnt part is extremely dodgy and confusing. When one is fasting and walking for hours in the day just to reach 10k steps, it is enthu sapping.",3.0
Sanika G,Functional,"Good for tracking calories, vast database of Indian food. However, the user should have the option to adjust the calories per meal. The default setting of the app is not always convenient, would like to set my own calorie budget for each meal as per my routine.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The draw back is in collection of data with external source and calculation. When u connect it with google fit and google fit to mi fit, the steps counts syncs but the calories burnt has huge variation. I raised a ticket and got some explanation which is not convincing. Healthify me collects steps count from google fit and calories burnt makes it own calculations which will add on calories from mi fit. Which means actual calculated calories by healthify plus mi calculated calories which makes no sense. Its resulting twice r thrice more of calories burnt than actual which misleads an user. I request to developers on this and to tweek their algorithm. Other than this healthify is at its best.",3.0
Ishan Pardesi,Functional,1. App freezes once you add your own food. 2. Trader joes food options (cereal) do not exist. 3. The diet plan is very difficult to follow. It is difficult to cook 3 types to sabjis/dishes on a daily basis. And it doesn't end there really. The amount of ingredients in recipe are not consistent with the serving size the diet plan suggests. This leads to either either food wastage or not enough food if the serving size is on the higher side. Dishes should be repeated next day in diet plan.,3.0
Ra,Functional,The app is fine. It gives calorie count of almost every food item. However user cannot decide which food to eat using this app. I wish there was way where user could filter out which food item has most/least colorie count. It would be so much easier to choose. I guess this will not be beneficial monetarily for you guys. But it would be a good to have feature.,3.0

I understand you need to push your paid program, that's how you make money, but I don't want it.

Siyanatullah khan,Functional,"The Good The app is awesome for calorie counting for sure. You think of an Indian food it is there . Kudos for this DB. The Bad There seems to be a lot going in the app. It is a bit overwhelming at first. Sometimes while fetching data the screen gets stuck in loading ( seems like thread went out of control ). The Ugly I understand the need to monetize , however the constant full screen upselling is a bit annoying for sure . An ad enabled option with low sub for removing ad would be great .",3.0
A Google user,Functional,One of the better apps to track your daily calorie intake. However i am sick of the adds and them trying to sell a diet plan. If they could give us an option to stop adds without join a plan. I would like to pay the developer for just letting me track my food!,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"it would be better if we can customize the amount of a glass of water like 330ml or so. The point is to reach the water consumption goal. Also, probably being able to input the count of skipping rope ourselves would be more effective to count the calories burnt.",3.0

Tara Thomas,Functional,"There is so much hype around this app but using it even just to track meals is painful. For one, I can't enter the exact amount of Calories even if they are clearly mentioned on the product I'm eating. Also, saving a new meal backfires as every single ingredient in it is listed out when I add it to my daily plan, what's the point of saving it as a single new meal then? Constant upsell ads without a smooth freemium experience. Disappointing.",3.0
Mohit Bhadra,Functional,"Great work by the team but app needs improvements. If you go back from an active workout or kill the app by mistake , it does doesn't count the calories you burnt till that point. If you go back on exercise number 20 out of 25 and start again from 21 , it only counts the last 5 i.e only that session. This is very frustrating. Please make it so that it registers all sets/reps separately",3.0
Sushma R Huddar,Functional,The app is good for Strength training. But trust me Strength training kind of induces some anxiety...so i switched to yoga. The app features are pathetic for yoga. One has to switch between YouTube and healthifyme app and wait for the ads on YouTube to get over. This is not a good sign for a peaceful yoga practice. Also one has to chase the nutritionist repeatedly to get information on diet ! Not much comes out of them voluntarily! They copy paste replies from chatgpt ! Nothing else,3.0
Aman Tomar,Functional,The app works great......I just use it to count my calories and macros and have been using the app for a long time now. But since the last update the insight section has been glitching.

This very annoying i would like for it to resolve as soon as possible. Thanks,3.0
Manasi Shrotriya,Functional,"I'm having some issues with the app. The main screen shows the exact amount of calories consumed today, that is, 856, but the insights are showing 1005 no matter what.

Kajal Karn,Functional,"Over all a good app. But there are some flaws in the diet plan. Once you change preferences it still suggest the same cuisines.

The Unknown,Functional,Free plan does not show a progress against goals as a summary. You have to go one day at a time. Also calorie estimates feels very very low.

Divyendu R,Functional,"It's a great app for fitness enthusiasts. Well trained coaches and dietitians to enhance one's physical and mental health. To the developers: The only issue I have is the limitation of fitness watch/bands. Google fit is highly inaccurate which is highly used for devices not mentioned in the list.

I had to switch off the notifications overall. Except for the pushiness when it comes to notifications, I recommend the app.",4.0
Stephen Samuel,Functional,"Excellent app. Pros: 1. great workout plans. 2. great diet plan. 3. Great Studio experience. - It gives a wonderful balance between choosing strength and cardio, or yoga, which many apps may not give. 4. Polite coaching system. Addresses coaching related queries promptly, and up to their ability. Cons: 1. Toll free number does not work for any technical issues. 2. Raising a concern or issue was not also working 3. If you're slightly late for your studio work-outs due to technical issues or just for joining late due to fast-paced tight schedules at work, beyond 5 minutes, you are prevented from entering, and this I personally feel is wrong. This is a serious issue and needs to be rectified. All users who have booked the session have to be allowed to enter the studio work out sessions irrespective of being late or not. 4. Scheduling a call, is a wonderful system to let your coaches know when your will be free to receive their call, however there are times when the coaches call you directly. I never minded it, however there are other users who felt it to be annoying, as they might be in the middle of a class or some important meeting. I guess, all calls must be mutually agreed upon. This system also needs pruning to make the users comfortable. After all, this is a great app, but needs a lot of improvement.",4.0
Felix MÃ¼ller,Functional,"Love the app. Helps a lot to track your calorie intake and the different contents are nice to stay motivated. Only downside I am facing is that, when you want to ""update your goal"" it still take the previous to reach the targeted weight loss and if you want to ""change the goal"" it deletes all the previous data. It should keep the previous data shown but just change the goal.",4.0
Aditya G,Functional,"The interface could be more simplified or it could be just me as I'm more towards minimalism. That being said, i found the plans to be pricy and limited to a month.

Every time i try to refresh the sync, it shows error and that the sync timed out. Highly dissatisfied and disappointed.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The features are very good and the app is practical no doubt. One suggestion I would like to make, instead of just providing with the information in macros provide the user with the amount of micro nutrients too.

Need to fix this issue.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This is a great app. I absolutely love the 'insights' section of meals. It is a great way to know if you've had sufficient amount of everything like fiber and fat and carbs and proteins. I also love how Indian food is available in the database, which is often updated. But I'm not sure how much to rely upon the value parameters of those food items. A simple example which leads me to judging the correctness of the values is the difference between the nutrition values for 'Subway Salad' and the nutrition values if I enter individual elements of that salad separately. I would have loved it more if there was a separate section to just find out the details about a particular food item instead of having to check it by inserting it in one of my meals. Overall I am just an avid user of the application!",4.0
Shahbaz Waraich,Functional,"I love the app but after the recent updates, it has been impacted by a bug.

Shankar Hosagoudar,Functional,"From an Indian perspective, this is the best CICO app. The best thing about is the variety of Indian dishes which can be added easily with more than 90% accuracy in calories.

priyanna noeline,Functional,The app is good. It helps me track my daily food intake and the calories. It makes me be conscious about my food consumption and it really makes me feel good.

Kindly change the same.,4.0
Subhadarshini Mullick,Functional,4 stars because the app needs improvement. It needs to be even more user friendly. Undoubtedly the app is excellent for achieving health goals. Only improvement required is on the technical side. A person will often look for customer care calls if in need of something. I think the minimum should be there in the app.,4.0
Truffle Gallow,Functional,I would have give this app a full 5 â,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great local food database! A suggestion for future update (hopefully soon), please include a sync option for body composition (weight, body fat, muscle mass etc.) from other apps such as Mi Fit because it is quite tedious to manually update the entry everytime. A sync option with other apps for calories eaten would be nice as well. A nice addition would also be options for goal progress. A goal could be not just about weight, but could also be about body fat or muscle mass percentages.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This is a fantastic app for anyone who wants to manage his health and particularly his weight. However there is one problem and that is annoying me very much. The problem is that whenever I open the app a pop up opens and ask me to allow access to my Google Accounts and then it keeps on opening again and again, no matter how many times I refuse, by clicking the cancel hyperlink. Hey, developers, don't you understand that one time no is no, why are you annoying your users.",4.0
Krishna Pareek,Functional,I have been using the smart plan for almost 2 months now and it's so convenient to track calories and start beginner workout. A couple of updates would be nice in terms of changing calorie intake as per one's need and also having the option of adding specific quantity of the food intake. It's a good plan for a beginner :),4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Although the app is very good & using it for about a year but there's a bug in the latest version. It is overridding the alarm clock of the system & keeping the alarm on all the time. It is auto setting the alarm time even when the alarm is kept off (tried in different phones). After uninstalling the app, the alarm clock works normally. Please fix this bug.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The App is great. I mostly used it for counting daily calories. After using it for a month, I was able to keep estimate count of my calories w/o using the app. I think it will be more helpful if you have a smart watch/band to sync with and track the steps and burnt calories. Personal coach are available. They have excellent in-house organic products like their tea and coffee, if you are really into it. Since I don't have a smart band, I am uninstalling until I get one.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,Paid experince with nutritionist is bad. they had only four nutrition specialists. they are not available at most times. i was sold a plan stating that could have as many calls.. but i could hardly speak once a month. the app is good otherwise. And the fitness trainers are good. but the nutrition training is bad do not opt for it if you are buying a plan,4.0
saketh vydyula,Functional,"I had few problems with this App and when I pointed them out here, the service team was quick and considerate to resolve the issue very immediately. Very kind to even help me get the most preferable option. I am thankful for that. However, the App and it's services is subject to improvement. Kudos to the back-end and service team. 4 stars FOR SERVICE and not for the product.",4.0
suraj s,Functional,"I liked the availability of a wide variety of Indian dishes. It was very useful. One feature I would suggest is the subtraction of calories spent via exercise from total calories eaten. It would help us in the long term while we look at the bar graph. As of now the graph just displays the calories eaten so even if we are in deficit due to working out , the app does not account for that.",4.0
Shriti Sinha,Functional,I have been using this app since a couple of months and it really good. I have lot 4 kgs already without having to eat only salads. The coaches -Zeeshan and Mahereen have been extremely nice and helpful. The studio experience is really good and slots are available even at odd hours. The only thing I would want to change is that have some sessions which are for 30 mins.. this would help when we don't have lot of time and still dont want to miss out on working out.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's one of the best apps to track Indian meals. It offers insightful data into nutrition and helpful tips to improve lifestyle. The app interface is clean and easy to use. The customer support has been great so far. Syncs with Google fit. Took one star off because it doesn't let me sync my nutrition and water log data to my Fitbit app. Or instead, the app should let me add my Fitbit Charge 3 device so I can track fitness data directly in this app and have all data in one place.",4.0
PNandi,Functional,The calorie and exercise tracking is good. But the only reason I did not give 5 stars is because there's no option to set a calorie budget. The app suggests 1100cals to me which honestly is extremely low for an adult. I really hope you can enable the option for a person to set their own calorie budget or change the budget based on a person's activity level in a week or their requirement. If I'm bulking then 1100cals wouldn't be enough. I would like a more realistic number.,4.0
Daniel Fenech,Functional,"Looks like a one of a kind app, exactly what I'm looking for. This is a recommended app for those who want to ""healthify"" themselves by adjusting their meal plans as well as daily exercise. It would really help if this app also connected to MiFit, rather than just Google Fit. Since I can't find a way to send suggestions, I'm adding one here. It would also be nice to track water by ml instead of 250ml glasses (if this is possible, I can't find it).",4.0
Kevin N,Functional,"Editing my previous review from 5 stars to 4 stars. The app is amazing. It has so many awesome features, however, the foods that are given don't always have the correct amount of calories or macros. An option to manually track it calories and macros suited to the products we consume would be a great feature. Other than that, no problems",4.0
Abhishek,Functional,"This is the Best calorie counting and tracking app for Indian food with an easy to use interface and a prompt team to help you out in case of any queries. There are also daily blog posts some of which are very informative but not with its share of minor errors. Depending on individuals one can opt to be part of conversation going on in the forum section of the app or one Can use it only for tracking calories, however one pleases. Overall, I am happy to have found this app.",4.0
Saurav Kedia,Functional,"Good app for tracking calories I am very bad at accounting my calorie intake but this app is very easy and convenient . Every food that I can eat has a calorie count in the app. Updated and we'll maintained. I do have one recommendation that of possible include a trend in the app. By trend I mean like for a week any person can check how much they have eaten , worked out ..,etc . The thing with trend is its gives the users a better picture of overall lifestyle . But overall a must have app",4.0
Srujana Kalluru,Functional,Your food database is the best among all other apps I have tried. My only concerns are: 1. It is not possible to use other Bluetooth based fitness and nutrition scales with HealthifyMe app. This means that I cannot use this app without buying your scales which I don't want to because I had already have other scales that I purchased long ago. 2. The food log doesn't sync to fitbit. All my other parameters are being tracked by fitbit and I don't want to manually enter twice in both the app,4.0
Manu Kartha,Functional,"Overall a well thought out app, motivates you to keep track of your diet by certain nudges... Tracking each manually can get boring after some time ..i would love to see a feature that lets you scan the plate and auto fetch the contents.. i am sure the technology is out there to do this..Google lens , image scan , artificial intelligence..all the best",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app is good to read the intake of our faily food consumption. walk sync and cal burnt is good. I have few suggestions, 1. Notes in tracking meals. - it would be better if we have option to take notes for every meal time. 2. Setting time. - if we have add time option while adding our different proportions of meals intake will be better to calculate the next time interval. i don't know whether these can be useful to all. this is just my consideration.",4.0
astha jindal,Functional,"I love this app and track my diet and water intake in it frequently, as well as how much effect it has on my waist circumference. Just one little hiccup. It no longer tracks my steps. I have linked it to Google fit. I have tried syncing them, restarting the app, restarting the phone, but the steps are just no longer counted",4.0
Mohit Sethi,Functional,"Everything is good, I was happy about samsung health integration, but it only works for steps and nothing else. I want to sync my sleep and calories burned from the samsung health app. Edit: bumped up from 3 to 4 star, thank you for considering the advice. PS: Samsung just invested in healthifyme i read on samsung next article, so I think it may increase the chances of better integration of the samsung ecosystem in the app.",4.0
Sudipta Ghosal,Functional,"I really liked the studio session but I personally felt that the smart plan is not at all useful and it's a waste of money. However the studio session is really really good. The coaches are very interactive, correct the posture immediately and give good motivation to push ourself",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Everything is good but option to add your own food with defining micro nutrients is missing. If I eat something with is not in list ""exactly"" as per components and I can't add it, my daily tracking goes for a toll. Bar code scanning option for food should be added. It is available in many health apps. API can be used for this scanning option. Please add that option to make it words best app.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app is overall good. I dont find anything bad in it but I'd suggest you to add a column with ""number of hours slept"" if the goal is to stay fitter. I realised that because I've veen using this app for a while and everything is going great, except for the sleeping part. I'd like to have a column monitoring that too. I guess it'll help me. Thanks.",4.0
The Mubbi,Functional,App is really helpful. I've found it really interesting. But I can't edit my goals. I'm trying to edit my goals but there's no way to edit. When I click to reduce calories goals it says you'll soon be able to edit your calories intake. And app will notify when this option will be available. I'm waiting for more than 3 months still can't edit. Please it is request to update the setting so that individuals can edit their goals. Bundle of thanks,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Update: There was an issue with not able to search food items and had to reinstall app. Thank you for pointing out it is issue with Vivo devices. I checked the setting for Vivo app store and disabled the auto update setting that was enabled by default. Haven't faced the issue with Healthify app since then. It seems even if we install app from Google play, Vivo app store was updating the app automatically. Not giving 5 rating because of taking out meal suggestion feature from free version",4.0
Punarnava Mehta,Functional,Its a great app. Only flaw that I can't set macros. Not even at premium. So that's disappointing. Which means I can't change to keto of atouphagy. I wish they would make it more flexible. It not about calories anymore it is important what the calories consist of.,4.0
suraj maharana,Functional,"Diet plan could be improved for more customization. When it suggest a meal(ex Lunch) there is no option to replace more items individually. U like few items in the suggested menu, but few not, so instead of it if you choose your preference it will be good.",4.0
Nidhi Madugonda,Functional,"This app is amazing. I've been using it for a really long time now. But one thing that I'm disappointed in is, it doesn't provide accurate calories for some south Indian dishes. For example I typed neer dosa calories and it showed 30 calories in the app but the actual calories for 1 neer dosa is about 110 calories. Could you please fix this.",4.0
Tanmayi Veeramachaneni,Functional,"This app is pretty useful. A good feature would be to have the option to track a fraction of a recipe. For example, if I make a dish which serves 4 people and save it as a recipe, there is no option to track one-fourth of the dish for my meal. This feature would be very useful.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app is really amazing, specially the calorie tracker with a large set of Indian as well as Continental dishes.....but some technical issues are still there, calorie burnt tracker is not working properly, specially at the time of editing any data....so, I'm requesting the technical team to fix these issues....",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I use this App for food tracking. It is a really good option for Indians. But, they should add an additional log for early morning regime like eating nuts, flex seeds etc as they don't form a part of our breakfast. And also of detox water. Also, I am also confused who inputs the calorie of each food and how come calorie requirement for breakfast and lunch is exactly same?",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"What I like about it: 1) Has calorie details for Indian foods. Suggestions: 2) Sync more data with Google Fit - heart rate, exercise details. Or maybe tie up with either Xiaomi or Mi Band Tools app team to sync heart rate data. 3) Include a premium feature that unlocks all the non-human interaction features such as the AI nutrition and the nutrition details (calcium, etc). Not everyone is looking for the personal coach aspect. The calorie counter section is really nice and having an option (paid) which unlocks everything there would be really helpful.",4.0
Vaishali Gupta,Functional,"It has wide range of foodstuffs and workouts to be entered as your record for those who always try keeping tracked their calories. Also if some thing is missing from the list they have the option for suggesting new foods, workout etc in their database, hence their data is strong in this matter. Its good.",4.0
Prachi Tiwari,Functional,"Being an Indian Vegetarian, it was very hard to find the local dishes in any other app. I found almost all cuisines here. Friendly UI. Only suggestion is please minimize the premium pop-ups. Sometimes the measurements are not accurate as per the dish.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,Option of alarming for diet and water is added which is very good but it just gives a small notification as a reminder. A little longer alarm can be the better option. While uploading workout there should be options like reps performed with amount of weight in each set differently.,4.0
lavisha valecha,Functional,"The app is great, but I think you should bring the feature to enter the amount of ingredients present in it so that the calories and nutrients can be more balanced and you should also add for us to customize the size of individual items for example roti. I think all this will alow this app to calculate the calories and nutrients more accurately and also a default size and ingredients option so that someone who doesn't know the quantity of ingredients or size doesn't face inconvenience. Thanks !!",4.0
RITASHREE GOSWAMI,Functional,Everything is well and good with this app. And it is very useful and beneficial. Coaches are very caring and response quickly. The only thing I would suggest is introduce syncing with mi fit bands. It will be very easier to sync the steps.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app is good for tracking your daily calorie intake, and even helps you to curb your eating habits to a great extent. I personally liked the wide range of foods you could search through the database, but push ads for premium could be reduced. Also, please add an option to track workouts with MiFit in future updates.....",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Very useful to track everything, especially a balanced calorie intake. Easy interface. Helped me to lose almost 20 kgs. Some data duplication found and few bugs where calories don't show up and have to be refteshed many times. More items can be updated. Also try their advisory plans. Thanks",4.0
Rashmi kashyap,Functional,It's a great app to record calories especially if you are indian has a wide range of food items in the database. Few are not there but major things are available. The only issue is too much ads and calls from the marketing team but I gues thats how it work all in all a good app.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,it's a very good app for tracking your exercise meal and water intake . it helped me during my weight loss journey and still using it daily to monitor. various food options are there to find the exact calories for food you ate. one star less as it removed the option to connect to my activity tracking app,4.0
Wndering Wnderer,Functional,"I like the app. It contains Indian foods which other apps don't get right and the tips are informative. The customer service team is responsive, though you have to give them some time to respond to you (it's not a chat-bot, unlike other apps). Wish-list: I'd like a widget to show info like Calories Consumed/Water Consumed, so that one doesn't need to open the app to check where they stand. Thank you for the app.",4.0
Ashwin Kumar,Functional,"A wonderful way to keep accurate track of your calorie intake. The app also keeps you motivated enough for the day. The database caters to almost all kinds of diets and food products. One small point to improve is the database for ideal weight category as per Height, age and sex is on the stricter side. The app should follow ICMR guidelines.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,It's a fantastic app...have used it a number of times in the past 2 years to achieve goals....however there is just one issue...you cannot change your daily calorie intake as per your wish....please allow us to change that as per our requirement!,4.0
A Google user,Functional,Its one of the best app that I have came across in many years ..everything is good but your app interface is almost same as it was from a long time ...with time people expect some new interface for the app ...One last thing is that I find that hiring a coach seems to be a bit more expensive ..!,4.0
El Sh,Functional,so many features available that do not require any payment. Additional paid options like potential nutrient gaps. Can create meals so in the future you can choose meal instead of putting in individual ingredients every time. Still to check out all features but is an impressive app for anyone looking for a thoroughly comprehensive starting point. This app is highly customisable and can tailor build for future ease. Definitely worth getting for sure.,4.0
Alankrit,Functional,"The app is amazing, we can use every other features which other apps gives us for subscription. Though it would be very good if we can add our calories goals on our own not by the app based calorie goal. Do include this feature though it's a great app for fitness!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"As they say the more you count, the less you eat!! HealthifyMe is a great tool to keep a tab on your calorie intake. It also recommends food items which are balanced in micro and macro nutrients and are required to fuel your fitness goals. It also motivates you to follow your diet plan and calorie intake.",4.0
Muahammad Nizar Hazmi Noor Ikhsan,Functional,"Really love it! At first, I only download it for the calorie tracker but it can do much more! And I also want to suggest a feature where the nutrients is displayed in a chart, ie: pie chart... Most calorie tracker app have it",4.0
A Google user,Functional,The coaches and supporting team are very helpful. The plans are flexible according to our need. The calorie burnt feature of the app sometimes show technical errors. Other than that I am satisfied with the app.,4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Great start off. I would like to see where this app goes! I love the exercise inside of the app, as well as many other nice options. However, my Withings/Health Mate scale cannot update automatically. There is no quick calorie update if what you've eaten isn't measurable or in database.",4.0
Kamal Kumar,Functional,"Great app.. the food database is so vast compared to other apps I've used like FatSecret & Loseit and this app provides much more details on micronutrients as well.. a few thing that can be improved is that you can't see nutrients on weekly or monthly basis, hopefully they'll add the same soon! And if they can also add dark theme in the app, that'd be great!",4.0
Nirmal Dennis,Functional,All things are excellent except one thing. The one thing is that you need to provide an option to make a workout routine and save it as in myfitnesspal. It could really come in handy when tracking daily and regular workouts.,4.0
Sireesha Repaka,Functional,The app is good enough. But I have few more suggestions which helps the users a lot. If there is a bar line for every food item we eat which indicates how healthy it is will make the users aware of it. Eating any food item counts the calorie But what's important here is eating Healthy food. If a person eats pakora then the bar should indicate a low Healthy food rating as it contains more trans fat. So the person understands that he should try to avoid eating pakora.,4.0
YoBlaze 9,Functional,"The app has good options. Suggestion: The calorie tracker should have option to log time also, when food was taken. This can help plan calories for next meal, based on BMR and workout plan. It is still not a complete health tracker, there is scope for improvement with enabling connect weight scales or related app support.",4.0
Alakesh Sarma,Functional,"My experience was awesome the features in the appare really practical and useful but there are some problems to I was using this app from nearly 6 months there is no way for trial for their smart diet, workout plan anyway I have taken a 12 months plan but there are some errors to the app keeps crashing even my phone's RAM is 8gb there were no such problems accept the trial one before the update I request the team healthifyMe to solve the as soon as possible.Thank You.",4.0
Abhishek Maheshwari,Functional,"I liked the app more when i didn't buy the premium. I bought a subscription for 12 months. The diet plans are pretty good but why dont you have specific day wise workout routines. You just have a list of workout which are not even muscle specific just upper lower body splits or HIIT. I had the above issue and they said it will be resolved. So 2 stars for diet, 2 stars for the customer care support. I'll add 1 star when my issue is fixed.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app makes tracking foods and creating diet plans super easy. It helps develop fitness habits over a period of time.

Kamlesh Solanki,Functional,"All of the Tracking features are fantastic, but my favorite is the Foodbank recipe and workout choices that can be synchronized to my Samsung mobile.

Sachin Gupta,Functional,Fantastic learning with this app ! All my myths and my thoughts about food have changed !

Kunal Ghedia,Functional,"I had used this app when it had lunched... It made me achive my weight goal ..and then I lost the touch with it.. I can track calories and they have mamoth list of items, so it was easy to track it . i could count the needy calories and toss the extras.

pushpa sanap,Functional,This is the first app for which I am giving rating. This app is so much awesome that can't be express in words. Once you purchase premium plan then the coaches guide us to meet our goal. If u want lose weight then this is the perfect app to use. The coaches are so much humble and fantastic which we can't get anywhere.

A Google user,Functional,the way it tracks nutrients for foods we enter is good. the UI is inviting. only thing is that it tracks only 4 major nutrients and does not show cholestrol intake. for whatever item i enter it shows cholesterol is good. so i feel it must be false reading. otherwise the app is very motivating and help you keep going with its prompts. great job.,5.0

Prateek Mishra,Functional,"The micronutrient tracker on the free version says upgrade to unlock all nutrients. It would be fair to assume that vitamins and minerals would be tracked. I upgraded, to find that only 5 micronutrients are tracked. On trying to complain and request a refund, I was simply met with a ""feedback will be passed to the team"". Edit: I have been issued a refund, a fair and commendable action on their part. It's rare that feedback actually gets passed on.",5.0

A Google user,Functional,"It is an amazing app that carries out our daily calorie chart, what we need or what we seek in order to keep our health balanced, the type of foods available and also the kinds of ratings given, they all help alot, and its an amaizng app for the ones who go to gym, as they require a check on their calorie intake",5.0
Sudipto Majumdar,Functional,"I mainly use it to track calorie intake. A large food database (specially cooked Indian foods). Calories of most foods stated seem to be as per USDA. It's best if you get a low cost kitchen weighing machine to track precise weights as not all glasses, cups, bowls, fruits, veggies are same size.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,It's a pretty good app. The ads are a little annoying from time to time but I'm not gonna complain cause it's a really useful food/weight tracker. It has almost all Indian food and I'm mainly recommending it for that reason.,5.0
Ramesh R,Functional,just downloaded it to track calories. It is very useful. I will try out their other features which i am confident will be as awesome as the calorie tracker. A day/week wise menu planner option will add value,5.0

Natia M,Functional,"I have loved this app, and I do pay for the subscription. In recent months, there have been quite a few glitches recording my heart rate and syncing from my watch as well as syncing activities from Google Fit. I contacted Support, and while they provided various suggestions, all of which I tried, the excuse is now the ""third-party apps."" Sorry, I expect more from a paid app, and if you can't deliver what you advertise, then don't charge for it.",1.0
Sandra Rodriquez,Functional,"I just downloaded the app 1 hour ago and signed up for the yearly subscription. I tried getting on the app on my phone, and I got the following error: There was an error starting Cardiogram. I closed and re- opened the app numerous times. I read through the reviews and found that most people were having the same problem. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before downloading and signing up for the yearly subscription.",1.0
Chris Kueppers,Functional,Stopped logging heart rate. Up until recently the app stopped charting your daily heart rate. Now it just shows it blank where it would previously show it on the daily graph. It shows the data above it like resting HR and such but not on the chart/graph. On my watch in the cardiogram app it shows the heart rate. All permissions are correct. I sent an email about it on the contact us page but just an auto reply was received.,1.0
A Google user,Functional,"I paid for the annual subscription during their flash sale in December. The features lasted maybe a month, then disappeared. I tried to contact their support and have heard nothing back since I sent the request two weeks ago. If you use this app, never upgrade, you won't get any of the extra features they advertise and no one will help if you have issues.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Not that useful if you already use a health monitoring app. It takes a while for the data to load, whereas I can see it all automatically on my Fitbit app. Also, it doesn't load all the data from my Fitbit watch & app, like sleep data. And I didn't even try to plug my birthdate in because it wants you to scroll back one month at a time from today!!! Why wouldn't they make an option to just TYPE it in?! Not very functional & very redundant.",1.0
Keith Sanders,Functional,"During the installation process, I sync'd with my WearOS watch, then the app on the phone wouldn't progress past a screen that demanded that I subscribe to one of two options via an in-app purchase, even though I clicked the ""Try for Free"" button on the preceding screen. I wasn't able to use the app at all, so I killed it and removed it. Seems like false advertising.",1.0
Jessica Honea,Functional,"Just.... No. Installed it on my watch, installed it on my phone, tried to sync them. The minute you hit decline on the ""give me money now"" page it dumps you back to the sign up page. I even tried to log in thinking maybe it was done. But nope. There is no x to close out of it. You hit decline, and it completely deletes any progress you've made towards signing up. Will be deleting the app off of both devices and never downloading again",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"I contacted their support the day I signed up for the premium trial and never heard back. Now that the trial is over and I'm signed up for a full year, the app is even less functional. It will not sync with my fitbit. I can't get up to date information. And clicking on any of the ""premium"" features simply pulls up a popup message asking if I want to sign up for the premium version. I AM SIGNED UP FOR THE PREMIUM VERSION. And I STILL haven't heard back from your support team.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Every time I try to update to the Premium Package at the current sale price, the app won't let me. I get a message: ERROR Your order is processing, your item will be available in a few minutes. When I hit OK it says ""An error occurred please try again. I've tried 6 times and the same thing. The only reason I wanted this app is for the premium package. I had gone thru the whole order before and entered my credit card etc. but nothing showed on the account and the premium package wasn't activated. WHAT'S UP??? I'd rate my experience with 0 stars if that was an option. It looks like they don't want my money.",1.0
Ann N,Functional,"Second review - The cardiogram began working again as it should. It lasted for 6 days this time. last night it stopped monitoring my rate every 3 minutes as scheduled, did not record my rate on the graph, or monitor my sleep. It isn't the watch. It's this app. It is inconsistent and not reliable. I have tried resetting the app, unfortunately that wasn't helpful either. You do not need a premium account in order for this to function properly. Please advise on how this issue can be fixed.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Worked great up until 2 days ago. Timeline won't show any new graphs beyond 2 days ago. Was this a free trial type app? Update- It had now been a week and the app still won't work. I can still get current HR through the companion app on the watch, but the phone app will not show that it is connected or getting data. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but nothing is working. i really liked this app for the few days it worked. Oh well.",1.0
Charisa H,Functional,"I tried setting up an account. When I decline subscribing for the paid version it kicks me out and I have to sign back in and go through putting my DOB, gender, etc. only to be kicked out again once I declined subscribing to a paid version.

Jennifer,Functional,"I can't even use the app, it prompts me to sign up for an annual subscription. When I decline, it logs me out.

It will not let me get past the login screen.",1.0
Chris Carnevale,Functional,"Worked great year one. Since August 2023, App does not track unless manually pushed to do so and only records for that moment.

Amy McMullen,Functional,"Used to be free, then offer basic being able to view heart rate, now only options are paid. Can't even get passed the subscription page to view past results.

April A,Functional,"Despite paying for the subscription I am locked out. I've been using this app for over a year. It has recently become very inaccurate. Definitely not a service I feel is worth paying for. I've waited 6 months for a doctor's appointment with a socialist who agreed to see me on a weekend. I wasn't able to show him ANY of my data yesterday and wasted $400 to see him, because a glitch in this app that wanted me to pay AGAIN to access my data. There are much better alternatives to use.",1.0
Brianne Crumley,Functional,I have used thus app for years to help track my heart rate for my chronic illness. Until today I was able to use without a subscription and now it won't let me log in. I've paid for a yearly one before but it's not in the budget right now and it is important for me to track my heart rate to see if I need to take more meds to help keep it stable. Now I am unable to do so. Thank you.,1.0
Pavan Luhar,Functional,You literally can't use the app without paying for the subscription... I have Fossil Gen 6 and that requires this app for some reason so only reason I have it is because of my watch and my watch keeps track of everything on its own so this app is literally not necessary. I don't understand why they don't give you ANY features without paying for it. I'd be fine if only thing I saw was heartrate and history that I already have access on my watch. Smh.,1.0
nqobile ndlovu,Functional,"Cannot get past the fact that I've never used it, and they want me to sign up to pay without having worked through the app. App is giving scam vibes to sign up for the 30-day free trial, you need to register your payment method???

Amanda Farricker,Functional,Became a give me the money app and a useless app. Lost all of my progress of 2 years and insistently kept bringing me back to the sign up page if I declined a subscription. No thanks. Thanks for becoming a useless app. Not all of us have the money to pay for this especially people like myself who have chronic illness. Stop parading around as a free app when you're clearly not. Deleted and done. Have fun ripping people off.,1.0
Todd Webb,Functional,"A paid app to access a very basic function of a smartwatch. It's a shame that after purchasing high end item they still expect you to continue to pay for each feature. No thanks, other brands know how to do it correctly.",1.0
Tony M,Functional,"Completely logs you out if you don't pay. Lake another viewer said, as soon as you click that you don't want to pay now, it logs you out. No pass go, no message, no nada.

Sven,Functional,"Phew. - Instantly tries to connect to Facebook on first startup (edit for clarification: that's a network connection, not an account connection) - Account creation mandatory (already bad practice for health-related apps) - Account creation *only* possible via Google account (even worse) So yeah, three red flags before I even get to see the app in action?

Mal,Functional,"You went paid only?? I don't want your module. Just wanted to track my heart rate for POTS. Nevermind. Not paying for this. Goodbye, after a year. You already quit the continuous measurement sync .. why bother using it anymore if it's forced to be paid now",1.0

Marie G,Functional,There is no more free feature. I loved this app. I had 5 stars in it. I don't want to pay for the app. What I got for free was sufficient enough just to give me my heart rate and monitor my sleep. Everyone needs money these days. Subscriptions are so stupid.,1.0
Amanda VandeWalle,Functional,Paid for the plan and it still won't sync properly for alerting to heart rate zones. Fitbit already tracks my heart rate. That was the only thing I wanted the app for.,1.0

A Google user,Functional,I signed up to premium free trial. All I wanted it to do was to alert me if my heartbeat went above or below a certain number. Heart rate stayed on the same number even though I kept pressing the synchronise button.

A Google user,Functional,"it offers subscription therefore it should be punctual, highly configurable with a lot function and clear interface and it is NOT, not even close. I have to say somehow it's successfully built against itself since watch version is syncing heart rate to other apps just fine so it's not wearable issue and same data won't show up on this corresponding app what is ridiculous.

P Fernando S,Functional,"Misleading app. The report scores me a 0.8. Doctor shows otherwise... Also the fact that this app uses your heart data to feed their databases but at the same time will keep your data history behind a paywall is predatory.

Zafar Hussaini,Functional,"Deceitful developer. As others have noted, the developer hooks you into this from an app preinstalled (on my Samsung Watch 5 that I just purchased). Unless you pay right after installing it, you're thrown out. There is no free trial period as the developer claims in replies to comments here. Nor is this true that it ""doesnt come preloaded"" as claimed in a reply posted in March. Do not support scamming developers. I am sure there is a better app from an honest developer.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app has not connected to Fitbit since last week. Unfortunately, this was not the first time that the connection to Fitbit broke, the previous time lasting about 2 weeks.

Baylee Bailey,Functional,I got a notification today that my heart rate was below 40. I looked at it was a random blip in the middle of high 60s/low 70s. This happened the other day when I took off my watch and it said 32 but I never got a notification. I've been trying to communicate with support about the glitches I've had. And they no longer respond. So support is out the window. I'm trying to find out if these blips of random lows or highs could be because of the reader or if cardiogram glitches at all.,1.0
A Google user,Functional,Does not collect the correct data from the Fitbit app. So data accuracy is a big question mark as far as this app is concern. And the bigger concern is that this inaccurate data is going to be used for research. My suggestion to all is that if you feel data points are incorrect by cardiogram app then disconnect you fitnesss app and uninstall the app.,1.0
Bruce Michael,Functional,"Do not buy premium. Do not download unless you are using the basic functions of this app ,that still messes up your data every month or two.

Wendyy Tgytg Zinn,Functional,"Loved it until recently. October 29 was the last time it actually worked. I open the app and although all permissions were given, there are only a few measurements.

A Google user,Functional,"Had this app on my phone for a while, gave permissions for Fitbit access. Absolutely nothing recorded. Cardiogram may be reaping my data, but I am getting nothing in return. My advice is to revoke cardiogram fitbit access via the fitbit web page if you are not getting added value from the web to stop them reaping your data.",1.0
Phil Bennison,Functional,At first it looks great but as it can't send data to Google fit and for some reason it doesn't seem to record above 110bpm it's just no use to me. Using a TicWatch Pro and it doesn't have any problem getting regular readings but not going over 110 is a large issue when other heart rate apps don't have this problem for me.,1.0
Yoon Kimn,Functional,"It worked for a couple of months, and then all of a sudden, when I try to open it, it says ""There was an error opening Cardiogram.

A Google user,Functional,"As many other users said, this could be a very good app if it would work properly. Even though I set it to measure my HR every 5 minute, usually it measures only a few times a day (or at least it syncs with my OnePlus 7T Pro this many measurements). Having only 4-5 measurement for most days, it is completely useless to use it and drain your smartwatch's battery.",1.0

A Google user,Functional,"Edit: I'm using a Ticwatch E with Android Wear 2.1. Phone Android version 8.1.0. The issue is still happening. The apps Heart Rate Plus and Heart Trace are both able to auto-monitor and detect heart rates above 140 and below 50. I was excited to find this app finally working (for a long time it wouldn't open on Android 8), but it seems that the heart rate measurements are capped between 50 and 140. Every day my highest heart rate is exactly 140 and my lowest is exactly 50. I know for sure that my heart rate goes higher and lower than that daily (I have a medical condition, and see drops into the 30s and spikes into 180s and above very frequently) and other apps that can do continuous monitoring on my Android Wear watch have no trouble capturing that. So I'm not sure that this app is going to be useful for helping me to monitor my heart rate after all. It's a shame because I do like the way the info is laid out and I was looking forward to finally using it.",1.0

Thomas St. Pierre,Functional,This app seems to work in spurts. It will take measurements reliably for a few days and then skip a few days for no reason I can discern. Most times when I check the app I find it has taken maybe 4 readings all day long. I also never get notified for high / low heart rates which is the entire reason I purchased the Fossil Gen 5 so I could use this app in the first place. Disappointed. UPDATE: This app is garbage. So frustrating. I'll be riding out the remainder of my subscription and cancelling.,1.0
Dusk Breaker,Functional,"The pricing policy is an absolute disgrace! The 30-day trial period can only be activated if you sign a subscription beforehand: reportedly for $49.99/year or $6.99/month.

Pavan Luhar,Functional,You literally can't use the app without paying for the subscription... I have Fossil Gen 6 and that requires this app for some reason so only reason I have it is because of my watch and my watch keeps track of everything on its own so this app is literally not necessary.

rsx,Functional,Developer is trying to use HR data to guess whether HRV is a marker for more severe cardiovascular conditions without even a consistency in how the data is collected.

Michaela Trelby,Functional,"I really want to love this app. It tracks my heart rate FAR more specifically than my Fitbit app does, which is so important for my needs. I can see every little spike and drop in my heart rate, even if it only lasts a minute. However, the app itself is glitchy, frequently will not open at all without restarting the app multiple times, and when I do get it open, there will be gaps in the data, as if I had taken my watch off, or it will refuse to refresh collected data.

A Google user,Functional,"Really like being able to set HR monitoring to the exact minute interval, but that's about all there is to like about this app right now. Skips random intervals throughout the day for minor data blackouts on the chart. The biggest failing of this app overall is accuracy. According to Cardiogram, my heart rate NEVER exceeds 110 bpm, even though Fit and even Mobvoi tell differently. Please fix this so you can even claim basic functionality for this app.",2.0
Rayven Burke,Functional,This app is great for being able to constantly measure your heart rate and put in tabs for workouts or panic attacks and see the timeline over the day and particular hours.

Alan Fidler,Functional,Not reliable. The biggest issue I have with this app is that it displays data on my heart rate when the watch is not even being worn and is sat on a table top being charged up.

A Google user,Functional,"I appreciate the idea, but the implementation is flawed. Apart from a confusing UI, it failed to read data consistently from my smart watch.

Alan Fidler,Functional,Not reliable. The biggest issue I have with this app is that it displays data on my heart rate when the watch is not even being worn and is sat on a table top being charged up.

Justin Reese,Functional,Not a lot to it for how much it boasts to include. I was even on the premium free trial and thought that didn't have much going for it.

A Google user,Functional,Regarding resting heart rate. I earlier had fitbit and now i am using wear os (fossil sport). My resting heart rate in fitbit as well as google fit has always been between 45-55 bpm. But cardiogram always show 60. Never 59 never 61. It always shows 60 bpm as my resting heart rate even when for the same day google fit shows 45 or 47 or 50. The cardiogram resting heart rate never fluctuates. I feel the functionality is broken.,3.0

Bawa Jose,Functional,I personally like the app and even wanted to subscribe after exploring it along with my wear os watch. Later after few mins observed faster battery discharge on my watch. Charged the watch to its full at night and kept it aside to wear it for the morning walk. Woke up in the morning and noticed the watch just had 1% battery left. So uninstalled the app. Edit: In reply to the developer.. After all why should the app keep measuring the heart rate when the watch itself is not worn in hand? ðŸ¤”,3.0
Ali M,Functional,The cardiogram doesn't update quick enough to tag things . I keep trying to update it myself so I can tag what's going on during that time and see how my heart rate was as well but it's not updating for the current time etc . I hope I'm making sense . How do I fix this if I can ? If I'm having symptoms etc I'd like to tag them as soon as possible .... Also my sleep time is not accurate . My fitbit will say like 7 hours and cardiogram says 3 ? I like the app so far besides those part :/,3.0

A Google user,Functional,I updated this from a one-star. It's getting better. Fixed a lot of the problems it had at first. Still I'm trying to understand what benefit this app has for me.

A Google user,Functional,"3rd day update: No simple way to disable the background check. Pretty Annoying have green strobo every 5 minutes while sleeping. 2 days into it.  WEAR OS: Set the interval to 1 minutetime frame on a cheap excellent Ticwatch. I would estimate a 15% battery/hour or 6 hours to drain completely the watch. The default configuration is set to 5 minutes so probably drop to a 3/4% / hour. Configuration is nice but I still have to test the workout mode. Would be lovely have to have a couple of dedicated ""face"" (terrible name). Implementing those is trivial and much needed for real time apps like these. ANDROID OS: Very nice, No Ads, (I assume their business model revolve around the value of the informations they mine ala WAZE). Pretty impressive custom developed Timeline; love the personalized tags; not perfect , the zoom is a bit a pain and you never know the timescale. Would be lovely to be able to pin the Summary for the day always on top  Not sure why the Leaderboards are on the Timeline page. Still building up the metrics.

A Google user,Functional,"Major issue is the lack of Google Fit integration. Beyond that it works great but I find the metrics tab not interactive, and a couple of minor incovininces. I'd really prefer if graphs could be projected into a bigger size and the amount of days could be changed on the trends section. As for the sleep duration section, I wish we could manually add it, as the app never seems to capture it and there has been no explanation of how sleep duration can be/is taken into account. And please could you guys make the interval heart rate capture option available on the phone app as well, instead of just the smartwatch app, I find that to be the single most incovinient thing about this app.   Aside from that, specifically for me it glitches on the polar M600 if the setting is lower than 5 minute heart rate capture intervals. Majority of my friends haven't encountered this issue as they have samsung smart watches.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"It measures heart rate over the day but lacks integration features or offline support. So if my watch battery is low and I put it on airplane mode to save some juice, it stops tracking heart rate. Then once I sync it to my phone again, I have no data from that time frame.

The 5 minute heartrate background measurements does not sync over to the phone app that often for me. I see that the heartrate sensor goes off every 5 minutes on my watch, which sometimes it syncs over, but most of the time my data is blank and has nothing for hours. The background measurements have never taken any measurements while sleeping for some reason either, even though the watch and phone are on as normal (never even registered me as asleep). Not really sure how to fix this. Heart rate portion of the app is very fast and accurate, which tells me the measurements do work, there is just some error in transferring the data. Using a OnePlus 5T on Oreo and a Ticwatch E. Looking forward to continuing updates in this app to bring it to how it is on the iOS platform.

One thing i don't get is how we know if our account is linked to my google fit profile, i have tried to check on the web too, but couldn't find anything, so one question to the developer is is its even possible to link my account to Google Fit, and i it is, then what are the steps to do so. Please do help.",4.0
Scott Newsam,Functional,"Update 6/22/20- Customer service seems to have greatly improved. I have been in touch with them frequently over the last few days. Linda has been very helpful. She has given me more insight into the workings of the app. I now understand how it works. For the insight part, it requires more input/feedback from the user, ie, tagging at different intervals to gauge heart activity. I am giving this another try.",4.0
Chris Dack,Functional,this used to work but now I only record heart rate every hour or so... update:most recent update which is commented as relating to notifications after changing frequency seems to have improved things.Are you sure that was just a notification change? that and because of rapid contact increasing review to neutral 3/4 until we get this sorted? thanks,4.0

Wade Hampton,Functional,"It seems to be just what the doctor ordered. I have it running full time to detect A-fib. I've only been using the app for two weeks, so I'll check back in about a month from now. My first impressions are good. I'm learning the program, and I like what I'm finding.",5.0

Bruce Berry,Functional,"It works! Received a fossil watch for Christmas. Messing around, got the cardiogram app going. And forgot about it. January 2nd I had a very bad heart attack. ended up with a stent etc a few days in the hospital. Got home looked at the app and it had called it. The notifications were not on. If I had the notifications on I may have had a better warning. This app works!",5.0
Oscar Merlos,Functional,It was working very well for 10 days. On the eleventh day the phone app stopped syncing the measurements as often as before. I have it set to take one every 5 minutes. The WearOS app does get the BPMs but the phone app just won't show them. Did my trial end or something? Edit: It seems it was an issue on my side. After updating both the phone app and the WearOS app things started working again!,5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've been delaying this a few weeks until I was sure the app was working. There was a small hiccup between free and premium, which was resolved after a short delay. The positive - support did respond, and did solve the data flow issue (the same one I see others mentioning). Since then - the app has worked well. I like the app and would buy it again without hesitation. It's giving me the information I need and can't find anywhere else. My Fitbit is the Charge 3.",5.0

A Google user,Functional,"This is the first time I have written a review for an app but I was really excited about this one. With the condition I have, I found the HR graph on this extremely beneficial but unfortunately this didn't last long as the data has not synced in over a week. I did send an email last Wednesday but have yet ro hear back. Would really love to be able to utilize this app again as there I haven't found any other apps that provide me the data I need in such a way.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"This sleep tracker has a lot of data. It can be a little overwhelming to work through at first, but it becomes easier to read and gives you way more information than other sleep trackers. I'm very pleased with it and it's relative ease of use. Linking it to my fossil wear os made starting it very very easy. Love it.",5.0
Rick T,Functional,"So far, I like it, gives me more detail than fitbit, lol. Hope it continues. Would love to go with premium, $25 a year, is ok, but would not want to pay $100. That is way to steep. I understand it cost money to run these things, but my oh my, that is a lot of money. If I could lock in, say 5 years at $25, each year, then it would be more tempting.",5.0
mjritten,Functional,"This particular type of measurement method may not be 100% accurate yet, but it's certainly a proactive action in a correct direction. There's no doubt that any method of regular monitoring is better than none at all. As many people have noted, the irregularity in readings is a concern, but remember, a watch isn't a certified medical instrument, and should'nt be expected to perform as such. I have no doubt the accuracy of smartwatch readings, in the near future, will significantly improve.",5.0
SÅ‚awek ChrÃ³l,Functional,"I always approach such applications with caution. I did the same this time. However, the application works with Garmn Fenix sensational. Steps, sleep or pulse moves sensational. I think the app only reads data from a sports watch and its accuracy depends on the watch. I think about the Premium version, but it's a small problem to me- I can't try it out without registering. Generally for the idea, execution and amount of data - 5/5. If you add Polish, I will give you 6 stars.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Smooth UI on both Android and Wear OS. Easily start a workout, check heart rate, or configure the app to periodically check your heart rate (in one minute increments) from the Wear OS side. After you're set up there, launch the Android app to review a record of your heart rate, divided into a list of days, as well as step data pulled from Google fit (I believe), and helpful tips regarding the aforementioned sensor data. Wear app used surprisingly little battery even at 5 min scan intervals.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I like it, be carefull when you turn your phone from vertically position in horizontal as the app trying to adapt to the screen it will not detect your premium subscription this happen because the app actually restart everytime you do this and developers should fix it, if not I got a lot of info about my sleep resting etc heart.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Awesome app! Still in early phases of development, but has the potential to rival Fitbit and Google Fit! (And I think they're planning to!) This app is being developed fast, and I think they've worked out most of the bugs. Try it and consider leaving a positive review to help boost its progress!",5.0
Jason Mogollon,Functional,"Love the UI. Information about certain aspects of my health is easy to understand. in future updates, I would like the ability to email my doctor the results that the watch reads specified to the last two weeks for example.",5.0
Wendy Stafford,Functional,This is the most reliable app to track my arrhythmia! It syncs to my Fitbit Charge 2 watch. Very thorough with results! Highly recommend this app! Another thing I like is you can record your day and how you feel in a journal!,5.0
Ali Al-Sheikh,Functional,Very interesting and useful insights when you leave it collecting your data and come back to take a look in a few weeks. I was shocked to find that my sleeping quality is poor and needs improvement. I'm surely going to work on it!,5.0
Meredith M,Functional,I love this app! I prefer it over my Fitbit app 100% of the time. My favorite thing about it is the ease of adding tags to any heart rate spikes I see on the graph. The insights tab averages all tags of the same description so you can see your trends over the life of the app. I also like the metrics tab. I knew I had high heart rates but it's really interesting to see my hr is higher than 93% compared the all the other app users.,5.0
KruchÃ© Everdeen,Functional,Highly recommend. This app is amazing. I absolutely love the insight I get in the app. It is extremely user-friendly and of I have any questions the team are extremely helpful and respond quickly. Even with the free version I still get alot of information. In the 2 years about that I have been using the app I have had 0 problems. My cardiologist loves the app and information as well.,5.0
Cass Champion,Functional,"Cardiogram remains by my side when doctors have given up. Through the use of real time information, I have the power to properly manage my meds and regain quality of life.

A Google user,Functional,Downloaded to use with fitbit charge 3. Cons - unable to manually enter any calendar dates and when you are old it is a pain to scroll back. Been running fir three days No DATA! Problem with date input fixed. Easy to use now. thanks,5.0
Amy Hall,Functional,This app connects seamlessly with my fitbit. The visual heart rate change graph with colors makes it really easy to tell when my sinus tachycardia is acting up over the course of a day. Much better data than the fitbit app for tracking trends for heart rate.,5.0
Matthew Chaney-Williams,Functional,"Can't give any rating as the app (downloaded and using for the first time) simply says to close and restart the app after attempting to log in - have done this numerous times, un- and re-installed, and the app simply does not work - yet it's on my wearOS watch? ***UPDATE*** - Thanks Linda for getting back to me - it immediately logged me in and all worked wonderfully - thanks for sorting this out, and review reflects both the app and the service!",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Does everything well, only little thing I could possibly say that maybe the UI can look a little tiny bit more modern, also either include instructions or make the understood if who are in the competing groups easier.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"This thing is amazing. It has turned monitoring my heart into a daily activity, something that almost acts like a social media check in, for me and myself that no one else sees, every day. I can see exactly when things happened in my day, and track them. It has already influenced my daily behaviors in less than a month.",5.0
Kristen Carter,Functional,I have a very low heart rate and being able to set it to send me an alert if I drop below 40 gives me peace of mind. Whether it's during the day and I can do a few jumping jacks to get it kick started again or during the night when I can just wake up and take some deep breaths....it might be silly but it gives me a small sense of security that something is watching my heart rate when I can't.,5.0
Andrej ZupanÄ,Functional,"If you want to follow your heart rate and related health data, this app is quite good. Integration with Garmin smart watches (can't speak about other brands) works smoothly. It's definitely an app to try out and see if this is what you are looking for.",5.0

Sebastian,Functional,Love this app. Since download and I brought premium. Its nice to have cvs and my favorite to have your print out be requested to show dr.s! It's worth upgrading. I'm hoping getting the print outs will even keep track of heart rate up to 2 months or so! Love the fact that you can share a link so your dr. Or someone can view eanytime with the premium upgrade. Also you can have it to send you allarts for high heart rate.,5.0
Laura Dutton,Functional,At 72 I thought this would be good information to have. Having a reliable step count along with the heart rate then encouraged me to tabulate BMI....which needs a lot of work! That in turn got me to finally do intermittent fasting. my steps are up to 8500 a day and increase continually. I feel energized and like I am on the right track. Cardiogram got that all started! Thank you!,5.0
Crystel Squier,Functional,"I have been using this for about 20 months now. I use it to record the data from my Garmin watch (using Garmin connect) and to monitor heart rate, sleep and symptoms.

Phil Newton,Functional,fantastic app. the only app I can find that's better that Fitbit. 1 improvement could be to export the graphs into Excel to make it easier to spot trends,5.0
Bill Blonigan,Functional,"Excellent free app. Syncs flawlessly with Fitbit and provides extra insights that Fitbit does not, or would charge for, including sleeping and overall average heart rates, seven-day sleeping and overall average heart rates, comparison of your overall and sleeping heart rates to the user population, and seven-day sleep time average.

EDIT: I was refunded and provided a new subscription, but I Iost all motivation for this app as I slowly clicked off lessons trying to get back to where I was. Ended up cancelling. Back to square one.",1.0
Emma A.,Functional,"Got the free trial with all the extra premium stuff. Would end up costing me ~200$ after the week was up. I loved it and was ready to give them my money. I actually enjoyed the app and believed in it's premise. However, the app is glitchy as hell. It would glitch out and freeze when trying to message support. And I could never get the food database to work (kept saying could not load). How can I lose weight etc without access to or tracking the calories in my food?",1.0
Ben Saunders,Functional,I first had this app in 2021 and it still cannot sync my workouts and steps without going through several 3rd party apps. Super ghetto considering what they want you to pay for the full version and part of the reason why I let my original subscription run out. Redownloaded a few weeks ago and it's still not fixed. Running latest everything on an S21. All updates set to auto update. Don't know how they still haven't addressed this flaw.,1.0
Matthew Elliott,Functional,"Has lots of bugs in the app. It will randomly decide when it wants to sync with your phone for step tracking. And then also delete random steps already recorded from previous days. You can enter them in manually, but those randomly get deleted also. The noom coins don't work. You are supposed to complete daily tasks to earn one, but it will never record that I completed the daily lessons. When you message the coaches, you seem to get generic or automated responses. Really disappointing overall.",1.0
Jennifer Rhodes,Functional,"The program is great, the app unusable. I first got Noom 3 years ago. And spent a solid year using the app near daily w/o issue. I came back to it with a horrible exp b/c I cannot complete courses. The courses are locked stating I must complete the previous course and I can't get past it w/o a 30 min chat before its elevated and I get an email 2-3 days later saying it's resolved and then I have to do it all over again after I finish another days courses. Using Pixel Pro 6.",1.0
festley gaming,Functional,"I updated my review to one star because of serious, unresolved technical issues with the app and the changes made to the program over the last year. My curriculum stopped progressing. No daily articles/lessons. That's a major part of the program. I was told ""they're working on it. I've been waiting 8 weeks on another issue. The level of support that I initially signed up for no longer exists. There's an upcharge for individual coaching. Small groups and the coaches that facilitated are gone.",1.0
Cameron,Functional,"Terrible experience. The program was ok (though it is just a pricy calorie counter), but felt duped when they immediately charged a large lump sum (several hundred dollars) to prepay for months-long subscription. I was willing to pay, but the upfront charge for many months was not made clear. Despite their claims that they won't, they refunded and offered me a promo code. When I tried to use it, customer service hell, not resolved after a dozen emails back and forth. Will never try again.",1.0
Andrew Bjorklund,Functional,"Don't get me wrong, the program itself is great. An excellent long term way to lose weight and keep it off. What I don't like is the app. They recently updated the whole UI and functionality of the app. Ever since the update I have had trouble using the app. Lessons won't load and sometimes can't be completed. Food tracking is slow to load, and more clunky in the previous version. Some useful features seem to be gone as well such as seeing your color breakdown for the day. Fix your app!!",1.0
Jason F,Functional,"Seems pretty decent so far. The over the top positivity and encouragement can be a bit much, but I get it. Be careful with the barcode scanning when you log meals and snacks, as some of them bring up completely unrelated products. The app is very slow to sync with Garmin Connect, but it seems to get there by the end of the day. Edit: I would rather get nutritional information from encyclopedias and keep track of my calories with an abacus than use Noom.",1.0
Sarah Biondo,Functional,"The android app is clunky and you can't save recipes, you have to enter every ingredient separately. Reading the articles started to feel like a chore and got to be too time consuming when I was working overtime every day. They also get repeated after a while. The constant push notifications made me anxious and irritated and I started avoiding the app altogether. I lost a few pounds but gained it all back plus some. There are better apps for calorie counting and exercise tracking that are free.",1.0
Davis Wiker,Functional,"Background playback is so bad. The moment my phone's screen goes off while listening to a clip, it starts to stutter&break up. If I'm using Bluetooth it stops playing within a minute of turning the screen off. It's super impractical to save my screen on all the time whkle listening, and the app doesn't force the screen to stay on anyhow, so even if it were practical, I'd have to do the work of tapping the screen to keep it lit up. Please fix this, because I like the product, but this is bad.",1.0
Allison Youngblood,Functional,"Agree with all the comments about the new release. It's so glitchy and difficult to use that I have lost momentum with my coach, my group, tracking, and reading....that's pretty much the whole program! It is hard to add food that can't be found. You can't add exercise for an earlier day; it automatically goes on today and then you can't delete it. In addition the notification and communication has been poorly handled so its always some new (bad) surprise.",1.0
Teresa Volante,Functional,"I loved the program when I used it a few years ago, but the Android version of this app is way too glitchy and is missing a lot of functionality. It doesn't open unless I've just restarted my phone (and that's no guarantee). No individual recipe options. Can't edit exercise info once you've hit enter or put in exercise for a previous day. If you put in your weight for a previous day it messes up the graph. Total waste of money if you have an Android phone. I also wish they had a returnee program",1.0
sara webb,Functional,This new update is awful! I can't get to any of my articles and it's so frustrating!!!! I'd already had a massive setback. Other than a few glitches with it not loading and moving to the next article after I've completed the one before it I am enjoying my experience. It also does not sync with my smartwatch app which is very annoying. I've also had difficulty getting it to keep the recipes that I add so I'm constantly having to put in individual ingredients every time which seems a bit much.,1.0
Amanda Anderson,Functional,"The Noom program is pretty great. The app needs some work. It's not compatible with Samsung Health (or Samsung watches) and My Fitness Pal. You can't save your own recipes in the app. You have to list every ingredient, every time, which is a pain. The information regarding calories per serving isn't always accurate. Sometimes the barcode scanner doesn't pick up the information you're scanning and you have to scan it several times to get it to work, often having to back out and go back in.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Seems like a great idea but it is not at all user friendly. Steps that should be a simple 1 click, take 10 or more taps to get done what you want. It is way too complicated to link a Fitbit, the barcode scanner never focuses, and the homepage is not at all intuitive to what users are looking to do in the app.... gave it a try but going back to weight watchers.",1.0
Laura Saur,Functional,"This app is buggy and you have to go to settings and clear the cache sometimes. My real problem is with the design. If you're on Android your weight graph shows only a few days. You can't back up and see the overall graph like Apple OS users. The one on one coaching feels like it's scripted even though it's a real person. The group, I just ignore now because it's not a message board but a ""feed"" and you can't look up old info. You're stuck with the app, there's no desktop version. Inconvenient.",1.0
Brett Helwig,Functional,"The program is great, and it works. However, horrible app experience when switching platforms. I have had 2 very long technical support email chains going with Noom, and nobody has been able to figure out how to make it work on my new phone. If you're looking at getting a new phone soon, DO NOT start noom until after getting your new phone. (I have been trying to get the noom app to work for a month!)",1.0
Monica Hemingway,Functional,"The program itself is really well thought out - very happy with it. But the app is a complete disaster and ""support"" for tech issues is useless. It worked fine on my Android phone. But when I also installed it on my iPad (so it's easier to read the lessons), it reverted me back to lesson #1 and there's no way to ""fast forward"". It set my weekly weight loss goal at 23lbs, won't track steps or add exercise calories... I wasted hours trying to fix it. Talk about DEmotivating! Fix the tech issues!!",1.0
Bridget Canning,Functional,"I wish this app worked better. I really love how helpful the program has been, but my stats and goals keep resetting and it often doesn't load. You would think with how much they ask for the premium version the app would perform better. The constant crashes and technical issues have gotten in the way of my weight loss routines and I don't think I want to pay them anything until the app works. Very disappointed. Edit: I got a bargain on premium. Worse support and the coach is a bot. Don't pay!!!",1.0
Radiah Cameron,Functional,The app is easy to navigate & program has been great thus far. I've experienced definitely more highs than lows in my weight loss journey over the past month & a half. I highly recommend the program. I would however incorporate more audio options for people on the go. I was saddened at the discontinued audio after the 4th lesson. It slowed down my motivation. UPDATE: App no longer works & I have done everything to rectify the situation other than uninstalling it & losing data. I am in 3 section.,1.0
Erich O.,Functional,"Daily data points are gone as well as the line to show fluctuations from previous weigh ins. Dates at the bottom are not active. If you're going to keep the every 3 days at the bottom, you should be able to click on the day to show the weight for any of those dates. This is a horrible weight tracker now. Put the goal at the top and remove from the graph area. Change it back to show daily data points. You should also include and option for weekly, monthly, annual end of month data.",1.0
Matt Kennedy,Functional,"This is one of the buggiest apps I've ever used â€” it fails to connect with step counters, and freezes 8+ times per day. No trouble shooting has helped. I've contacted customer support 10+ times and while they do respond they never fix it. There's nothing here you can't track with other apps â€”most of which are free. I opted for the convenience of the bundle (calorie and step counter, weight graph), but it's not very convenient and actually causes anxiety. Not worth paying for.",1.0
yodi mutty,Functional,"The actual nutrition course is really nice and well put together. But all the other features are pretty bland and just worse versions of other apps. The food logger isn't particularly good, and there's no way to connect to a better one. Or more than 1 device. You can pretty much connect a watch and that's it. It gets advertised with some sort of assistance (coach?), but it's a bot that just breaks down the meal entries. If I could, I'd give them negative stars for customer service.",1.0
Ron Richardson,Functional,"I started using Noom in July of this year. I was very pleased with the app's aesthics, functionality, and was having great weight loss results. Suddenly everything changed. The app now looks different, and even worse, takes forever to load. Some days I just give up. I used to be a big Noom booster, but now it's just a frustrating disappointment. Quality control and feedback was obviously not a consideration in your revamping the app. Too bad.",1.0
Abby Crowe,Functional,"Buggy, and doesn't work. I pressed the wrong button, and now I'm paying $160 every 6 months for something I don't want. First thing I go to is Manage Subscriptions and try to cancel and surprise surprise, it doesn't work. I reinstall and restart the app multiple times and I can't type in my email and password to cancel this thing. Thanks a lot loom, instead of losing weight, I'm losing money. All I wanted was a free trial to test this dang app out. Edit: Right after posting, I am now paying 180",1.0
Katie Pugliese,Functional,"I like the program itself but the app has a lot of problems. The barcode scanner doesn't work well, calorie information is frequently wrong, the search algorithm doesn't recognize a lot of foods, and there's no way to quick add calories. I also don't like having to scroll through numbers to track a portion size instead of just typing the number in. I'm going to continue the program because I like the way it's structured but the app doesn't meet the standard of other calorie counting apps.",1.0
Eric Palinski,Functional,"App is terrible. I can't even update my goal weight. There's a slide bar with a weight, an ""x"" in the top right corner, and a bubble in the middle with the weight. Clicking the bubble with the newly adjusted weight does not update the weight. The support window isn't updating as the agent is sending me messages. I have to leave and reenter to see anything. If I could give this app zero stars, I would.",1.0
LaNette Urbin,Functional,"I literally hate this app. There are a lot of very basic things missing. For example, you cannot edit workouts after you've logged them (e.g., if you make a mistake). The food logging is a complete joke. Almost nothing I scan or look up is in the app, so what's the use of it? They do not classify foods as green, yellow, or red if you enter them manually. Overall, find a new program. Also the calorie budget without exercise is way too low it's not healthy.",1.0
Kevin Smith,Functional,"This app constantly freezes my phone. It's hard to stay consistent and log every activity, food, water, everything...when the app doesn't work when you need it. Every time I open the app everything locks up and I have to restart my phone, wasting several minutes, just to get my phone back to a usable state. I'm just about done with this app. The program is not cheap! And I can't even use it 90% of the time unless I go through the open app, freeze phone, reboot phone, repeat, cycle over & over!",1.0
Laura Narney,Functional,"Content is great. Some foods are listed multiple times and in different categories causing the plan to be inaccuracies. Update: After multiple attempts for help via the app support, I have learned if they can't fix it they will transfer to a ""specialist"" and just quit responding.

A Google user,Functional,"So far a terrible experience. Doesnt track my steps. Food calorie scanner doesn't work. Program is glitchy. first coach just gave ""canned"" messages just like the bot. Not helpful at all. Now my app is repeating everything I enter. I'm planning to uninstall and reinstall it. It has been a technical nightmare. Maybe program works for weight loss if I could ever get it to work right. Oh, AND you have to be on it for 3 weeks before you're assigned a group to chat with for support. NOT HELPFUL",1.0
Dawn Hill,Functional,"I have been using the android app for 2 years. Recently, it takes forever to open and then once it does, it takes a long time to update anything.

Cannot be synced to my watch. Have to manually update my steps all the time and today.. that isnt working ...again. I would quit the app, but have a lot in it.",1.0
Erica Wilmer,Functional,Why Won't You Let Me Love You? I wanted to love the app. It has everything I want/need. But the app itself is terrible! I have had to uninstall it twice. It won't properly track what I've read or done. It won't consistently sync with my fitbit. And I've reached out to the help service twice with no response.

June Brown,Functional,"I signed up for the service with the flexible meal plan add-on. Do NOT do this! It was advertised as something customized, but it clearly wasn't. I mean, I'm sure they took the pre-set survey questions into account, but they completely ignored my list of food allergies. As for the app itself, it (1) isn't user friendly, (2) doesn't adjust mealtime reminders to your sleep schedule, and (3) the food database is woefully inadequate. Stick to MyFitnessPal or something.",1.0
Xana Du,Functional,This is not very accessible to anyone with vision problems. The amount of reading on a cellphone is way too hard on my eyes and you cannot increase the size of the neverending onscreen text. 2 months in and i haven't been able to get thru all the preliminary info to actually start the program. It restarts if i have to exit the program or try to go back to review. I did better with weight watchers - thought this was similar but it really isn't. Total waste of money.,1.0
Karen Dawson,Functional,"My favorite feature is gone! For years I used it to record distance, elevation and map any bike ride, run and walk. It motivated me to get out and moving. I had success tracking my exercise and food. It pushed me to go farther on my walks. I thought upgrading to the full program would give it back, but still cannot find it. I cancelled the program and uninstalled the app. I now use two apps to map my exercise and track my diet.",1.0
Todd Parkins,Functional,"App funtionality on Android is not good. You open it and it just ""spins"". No option to log water intake. In a nutrition/diet app? Really? No ability to zoom on weight loss progress graph. Food database is severely lacking and not very accurate even when scanning. Needs a lot of work! Lots of other free apps like Myfitnesspal work a lot better and this program is far from free! I could go on, but I think that is enough for now.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"I think the program itself is probably good but there were just too many problems. I went though the trial twice and I never had a goal specialist follow thru with me enough to make goals. My subscription got cancelled because I used the word cancel in a message to my goal specialist. There were other little pains, too much to list here. It could be awesome if you had the patience, but my weight is a big enough burden and having to work to get the program to work was too much.",1.0
Laura Dubany,Functional,"Good program..new app is a nightmare . I've used the program before and it was awesome, I lost a bunch of weight and I was excited to sign up again when I had a good offer.

I'm hoping they fix this at some point so I can return :(",1.0
Justin,Functional,"The program itself is great, but the android version of the Noom app has fewer features than the version for Apple devices.

I have to force stop it multiple times a day in order to update meals, exercise, and to read the articles. It is using the phone as a pedometer, which would be great since I have it on me all day long, but seems to be very hit or miss as to actually recording any steps. Due to a crash the app recorded 2 exercise events. There is no way to delete the extra one, even though the in app help gives directions on how to do it, and the only thing that support said when I contacted them was that they were working on it.",1.0
Aaron Perry,Functional,"Interesting, and mostly helpful program, but the food logging is painful to use and frequently inaccurate.

This program is not worth the money for only the lessons and no personal feedback or food tracking.",1.0
RN,Functional,"The weight graph is way better on iOS than Android. It is more informative too. Why can't we get the same graph on both platforms? The weight input section of this app sucks.

Åžeyma Brooks,Functional,"Same as every other app but hysterically expensive! My fiance and I are losing a few pounds together.

We will keep loosing the weight, slowly and steadily, with the app we have and just do more searching for the right exercises and meals for us. Save your money!",1.0
Theresa Piotrowski,Functional,"I am super disappointed in the food database as a whole. The barcode option rarely works and I can never find anything.

Neal McBurnett,Functional,"Noom doesn't bother fixing bugs, and wastes our time by not acknowledging that they know of the problem when we report them.

I enjoy using the weight tracker & food log, but there are better (free) apps out there for that. The lessons are a chore to get through because of the choppy/cutesy way they're written. I was looking forward to working with a coach, but the experience hasn't felt personalized. Disappointed.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"The idea is good, price is awful. I never even filled in payment information and yet I'm out $160 during a pandemic! I force myself to use the app and it stresses me out. How do you jump from a two week trial to an 8 month subscription?!? That is a long commitment for anything, let alone something that hasn't even had a chance to work yet. There are tons of free apps that help with weight loss, step count or food tracking. This app attempts to do more but I still wish I would've never tried it",1.0
Sarah Kelley,Functional,"Go all the way through the initial questionnaire and it says there is an error and may not be connected to internet.

My coworker has had a success with the program and I really want to try but having difficulty with app.",1.0
Christy Henderson,Functional,"Misleading. I bought it for the calorie tracking, but there are too many inaccuracies for it to be truly helpful. Also, I don't agree with the color rating. Chips and cake are rated the same as healthy fats like nuts. Many same foods are listed in different color categories, that it is confusing when trying to meal plan. I skipped the trial because I wanted to ""be all in"", but I wish I had saved myself hundreds of dollars and just done the trial period first. 4+ weeks, zero pounds lost.",1.0
E,Functional,"It's not worth it. The classes are mediocre and even though you're paying for it, it sends a bunch of ""motivational popups"" when all I'm trying to do is log my weight/food/exercise. The calorie tracking portion of the app is also horrible. You can type in the amount of grams, you have scroll all the way through like an old 2nd gen iPod touch. I would also say about 60% of the calories listed are not correct, so I typically have manually enter the calories of an individual food with said dial. .",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Barely any outside device integrations, food entry is a mess, first sign up attempt crashed, this app doesn't even feel finished. If I had to guess I'd say they were advertising it to get enough of a user base so they can get second round financing and turn it into a working platform, but this iteration is alpha at best. Sorry, but I don't have time to be on your testing team. I'll try again in a year if you're still around.",1.0
Janet Poteau,Functional,Can't update exercise if you need to. Can't turn off step counting if you want to (it's eating up my battery usage). I don't need it as I bike 80 miles a week. Day 4 but the Noom app needs quite a bit of work. It's a shame b/c some parts of the program are exceptional but these issues are not acceptable in this day and age. AND you can't even download an app for your PC. It sounds like they've been around for a while. What is taking them so long to clean up their act? Used Carb Manager. Now that is a GREAT program (and costs much less),1.0
Julie Merrick,Functional,Edit: The app has so many inconsistencies! The calories are not accurate with the labels on packaged food. The app pedometer does not work at all and doesn't sync with samsung devices. The color labels for food is not accurate. Very expensive for inconsistencies I love the program but having an android phone it's hard to get accurate information to log my calories. I wish I was able to build a recipe and break down the calories per serving. I also wish it had a larger restaurant data base.,1.0
A Google user,Functional,"This is a very sloppily designed app. When attempting to sync with Google Fit, it displays more than double the amount of steps that Google Fit does. When using Noom's pedometer data source, it's less than half. When trying to get technical support, it says to fill out a form, for which there is no actual form available in the UI. All of this, coupled with other strange and dead-end UX flows indicate an extremely lazy development mindset - at least for Android. I'd be extremely embarrassed to be associated with such a team.",1.0
Joan Seamster,Functional,"I was happy with the app, the food tracking and the articles about changing behavior. Have been using it about a month. And my app crashed yesterday and deleted ALL my data, my food logging, my saved recipes etc.... I reported it and I was told to delete and re-install the app. Which did not bring back any of my previous data. Be aware that this can happen to you and plan accordingly. Fortunately I had take screen shots of some of my key data, so was able to keep that information. Have requested a monthâ€™s refund or extending my contract for an extra month and will see how they respond.",1.0

Thanks for teaching me so much not gonna pay for something i can't use! 2nd e it has worked for a while and i love the content, the coaches and my group, but the app is still pretty buggy. It's really frustrating that i can't save my own recipes. There's a lot of errors in the nutritional info (when you log foods). And there's a weird bug since the 9.0.0 update, where the home page takes 10+ minutes to load!",1.0
Mark Bedard,Functional,"The app is buggy and poorly designed. Hangs up when loading CONSTANTLY. For what you pay, I expected more customizable features and certainly more reliability from an app you are supposed to be using throughout the day.

Cassie Camerer,Functional,"This rating is purely for the latest version of the app released Dec 4 2021. The entire UI was changed, and not for the better IMO. The search field for entering food items now acts like a web form and google password fill pops up every time you attempt to enter something. This causes a major headache just in trying to do the most basic thing in the app. I have been forced to roll back to the previous version where this is not an issue. How this got released is beyond me.",1.0
Autumn Hobbs,Functional,"I love the concept and I am doing really well in this program but the app runs so poorly. The scanner is horrible. It takes forever to get it to work, if you even can.

I ha e to use MyFitnessPal to create a recipe and then transfer the nutritional information over. Again, VERY time consuming. Now the step and water tracker has stopped working. FRUSTRATING!",1.0
Ashley McClure,Functional,It's great when it works but too often it's glitchy to the point where I can't use it. Sometimes nothing loads and I only see the loading placeholder (the diamond image) with no ability to interact within the app. Sometimes when attempting to log a food the screen flashes between options and I'm not able to see what I'm selecting. I'll restart my phone and/or force close the app but that doesn't consistently fix it. Update 7/20/22: Changed my rating from a 2 star to 1 star. Keeps getting worse.,1.0

Support couldn't help me, they just told me to clear cache and uninstall/reinstall app. Guess what, didn't help",1.0
Sarah Gain,Functional,I wrote the below review in 2022. It's so much worse now. I couldn't even access the app after 2 attempts to install. The content of this app is amazing but I've come back to using it in the last few weeks and it's now unusable! Every time I try and log food it crashed. And I do mean every single time.

They say 14 day free trial, but it's a lie, they have you add your payment info before you even know what your buying, then hope you don't remember to cancel.

lewis wyatt,Functional,Was going well until 3 days ago when the app was updated and has made it totally unusable. I've got in contact via the coaches and email support and still no fix. This is very poor for something I've put alot of money (Â£120!) and effort into. The point of Noom is that you follow it religiously every day and that's how you lose the weight and get educated. Well how am I supposed to do that when I can't access it? Save your money and energy and download a free calorie tracker instead!,1.0
Linda Dunbrack,Functional,"I tried to cancel my renewal within 2 weeks of them charging my card. I contacted their customer support, and they were not helpful in resolving. Since I was set up for an annual renewal, it was a significant amount of money. The services also have declined since I first signed up. Instead of being assigned a coach, they have social groups. If you are interested in Noom, I recommend buying the book. There are free apps for habit tracking and calorie counting.",1.0

Cassandra OOC,Functional,"Honestly didn't get past the trial because the experience was so bad. If you are an average person, it's probably fine. If you have PCOS or any thing that means your requirements differ from average, this is NOT the app for you. The calorie recommendations are treated like one size fits all and way too high for PCOS. (Which extra sucks because I know they advertise to that crowd, but they are definitely not designed for it. Support did nothing but copy paste generic posts.",1.0
Salem Silo,Functional,Another total scam. They drain you of personal information for 10 Minutes and then say actually it's not free it's a few dollars the first week and then $200!!!

Les,Functional,"I'm happy with the program and the motivational aspect of Noom, however, this app is terrible. It's a pain to log food, find recipes, etc. I've used WW in the past and everything went much more smoothly so if you aren't used to that maybe you won't mind. Tons of glitches with the app and freezes constantly. I've had to reinstall several times. Steps don't sink up with Fitbit app even after getting help troubleshooting.",2.0
Kristen Bahl,Functional,"I've just started the program and have had nothing but issues with the app. I've uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared the cache, everything support has told me to do and nothing is fixed. Then I'm told that my issues were forward to various parties (tech, program support, etc.) Just to be told others have the same issue but no time frame on when things will be fixed. It would be nice to have a web version to use when the app is being a pain",2.0
Tanya Mysko,Functional,"I've never been a big fan of the Noom app. They did make UI recent changes which are nice. Tracking weight and exercise is easy; food is hit or miss. I stopped doing coursework - there's no back to the last page, so you have to start the course over. And a lot of the coursework is typing things in and ""sharing"" it, which is a screen shot. I can never recall where I've done something. But a recent update is really buggy and freezes. It's unusable and so frustrating. About to give up.",2.0
Abbe Karp,Functional,"So far, I'm enjoying the program. It provides motivation and behavior modification to analyze what, when, and why you eat. I really like the psychology training, articles, and quizzes, but the app itself really needs a lot of work. The food logging is not great. A lot of the calories are wrong, you have to scroll to change numbers, and you can't make a large recipe and log that you're eating a serving. You also can't go back to articles unless you flagged them when you were reading them.",2.0
Josette Keelor,Functional,"There are some great things about Noom -- the articles, the food diary, & the pedometer -- but the app makes this experience so much harder. Sounds like they still have to iron out bugs for the Android version. I tried the one-week trial, and by day three, the app was crashing, freezing, and just generally being slow to open. I uninstalled and reinstalled three times, but with no luck. I also don't like that exercise doesn't seem to affect your daily calorie allotment.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I like this app for the psychological aspects. The coach checking in is helpful. I used it for a few months, but it was not worth continuing. It needs a place where you can write down and even keep track of the goals as well as the other thinking and reflection processes. It would help to be able to go back to your own writing and goals and to check off. It needs to include meal and exercise plans, that connect to your goals. Less talking.....more doing.",2.0
Brad Lipovsky,Functional,"Really not a very good app. Integration with the smartwatch isn't very good. there are numerous technical bugs that make it difficult to use the app on my phone. The app often freezes in one section and I have to click around to get back to where I need to be. The weight loss plot has a very strange vertical axis that cannot be changed which makes it difficult to read your weight loss patterns. Top this all off with the fact that it's quite expensive, quite a bit more than My Fitness Pal!",2.0
Mandy Pandy,Functional,"I like the content and the concept. However, it doesn't allow me to add my own recipes which makes it difficult to log home cooked meals. Also it doesn't have an option to synch with my samsung watch and when I try to synch with Google fit it doesn't work. It's frustrating because the program isn't an accurate reflection of how hard I'm working. In addition to it not accurately monitoring my progress for the calorie counting aspect. All of this makes it unreliable for weight loss monitoring.",2.0
Andrew Rail,Functional,"I love the psychology and the group support, but the app is so clunky. It often is unable to capture my steps, Even though it clearly states my steps when I open the settings. Also you get past the second stage, the audio portion is just awful. And there comes a point where the audio portion is completely gone. I've tried to address this with the company, and they just say thanks for the feedback that's good to know. But no changes are made.",2.0
Audrey Sellepack,Functional,"Great program! Horrible app. I lost 30 lbs (and counting!) Since March, and I'm happy with the content I'm receiving. However, the android app is neglected compared to apple's app. You can't see the full weight loss graph zoomed out, the lessons glitch out causing your curriculum to fall out of order, and the calorie counts on some foods are just flat out wrong. I'm canceling my program after 7 months because the app is just frustrating, but I do appreciate the idea, and the program does work!",2.0
Brian O'Flannigan,Functional,"This app is definitely unique and very user friendly. With all the different features, it can be overwhelming. Sadly, with each update it seemed to do less and less. The ""coach"" feature is clearly just AI sending you auto-generated responses. The group support feature stopped working. Then the app started glitching out so I kept losing all my streaks. The nail in the coffin for me was when they charged a full 6 month subscription ($150) without telling me.",2.0
Michelle Martinez,Functional,"The program itself is perfect. But the app needs A LOT of work! I was using the app a year ago and never had any problems. After having a baby, I decided to rejoin and, if it wasn't for my past experience, I would have cancelled my membership. The app is ALWAYS crashing.. multiple times a day. It makes it difficult to even log my meals. Also, some of the recipes have the calories computed wrong, so I was taking in more calories than I was recording. Other than that, love the program!",2.0
Chanelle Minor,Functional,"Concept is awesome and I was loving the programming. Now the app constantly crashes if it even launches at all. It's hard to be motivated to use it if I'm continually having to force close the app. This ends up taking more time and leads to frustration. I know I'm not tracking things the way I want to because of this issue. Finally, the step tracking rarely works. Even when I would get thousands of steps over the goal, my goal was lowered the next day, then jump up the next. Not consistent",2.0
Crystal James,Functional,"The weight graph before this last update was much easier. Before, the graph listed daily entries. The slider moved by the day so I could go back to check my progress. Not now. Now there's a wavy line, without dates, to show progress. There are dates at the bottom of the screen that change by 3 days at a time but there is no way to connect the date to the line. I can't see yesterdays weight on the graph itself, I have to go to that days home page. Please change it back! It's NOT user friendly now",2.0
Megan Gwynne,Functional,The app keeps crashing when I try to log my meals. Very frustrating when you are trying to be dedicated to the program and unmotivating. I like the ability to listen to the articles each morning but wish you could rewind 10 seconds if you miss content vs having to start completely over. I also wish you could refer back to articles without having to flag each one. This is a great program with a lot of science behind it but the app doesn't align with the quality of the program. Usability issues,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Nice program, but the APP needs A TON of improvement. The food database is wrong nearly all of the time, either the calories, or the portion sizes almost always don't jive with the nutrition labels, the bar code scanner barely works at all, and takes forever to scan, and there are too many individual pages. It needs to be streamlined. That being said, the program is still good for beginners, and for now I'll stay, but they really need to get back to work on this app, oh my goodness.",2.0
Kaitlyn Chambers,Functional,"Pro: I really like this system for losing weight and making lifestyle changes. HOWEVER! Cons: the app is bad, often have to reinstall or force close and reopen, and doesn't auto update. Sometimes it ""forgets"" I have done my reading for the previous day, too. Also, Noom's pricing is completely opaque, difficult to understand, and downright dishonest. It's a great idea turned greedy cash grab (complete with poorly done app). If you can put up with all that though, you'll get results.",2.0
rhonda keister,Functional,"I have loved a lot of the reading, no question there has been a lot that I have processed and will always be of huge help in the future. Other than that I have struggled, I have never had any luck keeping the app connected to my walking device, I've struggled with the calorie charts because they need updated to the food calories on the packaging, the bar code rarely works. When I have reached out it's not been very helpful. Not certain if I plan to renew after 4 months previously paid.",2.0
Kathryn Christiansen,Functional,"The app doesn't save any choices or decisions, so you can't review what I have ""committed"" to (and if I can't remember it I am not going to wind up doing it). It feels pointless making choices or answering questions that are immediately forgotten by the app, and never brought up again in the courses. I had hopes that when I comitted to an exercise goal in one week, the next week the app or coach would help hold myself accountable, but it just moves on to new goals that quickly feel overwhelming.",2.0
Jamilex,Functional,"The service is great at providing a new way of thinking your habits with eating. Overall, there's a lot of helpful tips and advice, but that all gets ruined with how often this app crashes and freezes. Especially when trying to put in what you ate and even load the app. It's difficult to enjoy the app and progress when the app doesn't even function 70% of the time.",2.0
Beth Flynn,Functional,"I wanted to love this but found that I had to manually enter every food individually after weighing it to get an accurate calorie count. Their easy options were typically off by half, adding 40 calories to your budget rather than the 80 it actually is. Also, you can't change the number of servings for the recipes. Basically a recipe for disaster. Or maybe just a lesson in resisting temptation. Oh well. I did enjoy the free trial.",2.0
Kathryn Ball,Functional,"I'm really conflicted about this review. On one hand, I love the program. On the other hand the app is absolutely horrid for android. Despite paying the same amount as the apple app we have less features, support, and more issues. I missed weeks of group because their system didn't work right. I only knew about missing out when I looked on other sites. I find the experience extraordinarily frustrating, on top of the stress of losing weight.",2.0
Brett Hancox,Functional,"Downgraded experience in latest update. Weight loss chart is now unreadable - y axis no longer features any values, the trend line has no clickable data points, and there is no ability to rotate and view horizontally. This screen is just one of many that are downgraded. And no, I'm not sending notes to an email address, so please don't respond with that. You don't need my notes. Just get the feature list of the old version and put back in the stuff you dropped.",2.0
Eric Martin,Functional,"Buggy App! I've been using the app for months and it feels unfinished. Then yesterday the app stopped working. When I open the app, the Home screen just spins and spins.

Just trying to lose some weight folks.",2.0
Kiki,Functional,"The program is working, so far. It's been less than a week and I've already made huge, positive changes. The app really keeps you on track. However...the app itself, as others have mentioned, really needs work. I learned from a friend who has an iPhone that there is a slider option in the food log. I've searched and searched for this in my app and can't find it. I measure all my food out on my kitchen scale in grams, so 85 grams of something is a LOT of scrolling in the app. Why doesn't the Android app have the slider???? Also with measurements...there should ALWAYS be an option for grams, ml's, ounces, etc. For coffee, there's not even an option for ounces. Instead it says how many ""glasses"". Very imprecise. I always check the calorie count against MyFitnessPal because I've seen too many errors. In the recipe section, when they break down the ingredients' calorie count, the screen is smooshed and doesn't allow you to expand to see some of the ingredients. Very frustrating. Seems like they put all their effort into the lessons. They really need to work on making logging food easier and more accurate. I would also like a way to know how much protein (and other basic nutrition) I'm getting. This, also, forces me to use two apps instead of one.",2.0
WÄ™drowny SÅ‚owianin,Functional,"The Noom diet is great, lost and kept off a ton of weight, this is for the app. The good: The design is pretty intuitive, not much of a problem finding what you're looking for. The bad: Every single time I use it, I have to open the app, remove it from recents, then relaunch for it to work. I sometimes find exercises double-logged, especially frustrating given you can't delete exercises. For an app that doesn't work without an internet connection, it takes up a lot of space. Why an 811mb cache?",2.0
A Google user,Functional,Unreliable calories. Numerous times the calories in items is way too high. Tonight's meal it overshot by 90 calories. Other items have been hundreds of calories off.

Joe Naughton,Functional,"Everything has crashed since the last update. Stopped syncing steps from Google Fit, and none of the troubleshooting steps work.

Greg Baughman,Functional,"The program has been great and really helpful. The app is absolute garbage, a poorly optimized mess of crashes and unresponsiveness. You can do 1 trying when you open the app (read an article, track breakfast, check settings, etc.), but if you want to look at a different option, the app will freeze and you'll have to restart. Steps don't give back ANY calories, it stopped syncing with Fit or Fitbit (and doesn't natively support Samsung Health which is... an odd choice), and it always crashes.",2.0
Paula Gephart,Functional,"I like the articles in this app but that's pretty much it. The calorie counts are off on a number of items, the app can't communicate with fitbit even though it is a setup option. If I try to manually update my steps, it doesn't save the change. If you refresh the app it will lose track of your progress. Rarely hear from the coach. Group is ok. I've lost weight on Noom mostly because I'm being accountable and logging the meals not really worth the $$$",2.0
Elizabeth Norton,Functional,"Edit: I'm putting in a lower review just based on the new update. I have seen the other comments and I am also experiencing the same crash that they mention. I did the troubleshooting steps that the technical support provided and the homepage is still endlessly loading.

Otherwise, I've lost 35 lbs and the curriculum is good.",2.0
Todd Sayers,Functional,"So far, it's not been working for me. While i have gotten some benefit from it (e.g., they help you choose lower caloric density foods), i haven't lost weight.

I'll try something new. I'll give them a few months (it's been two). BAD: no links to peer reviewed research, cutesy language It's just calorie tracking.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Very disappointing, I did learn a few things and enjoyed it at first BUT in the long run I found I did not lose any weight. It also did not work well on my iPad, so was difficult for me to us. Agree with other reviews, they make it extremely difficult to cancel your subscription or turn off auto renew feature. Had not used the app for months but was still charged for a new year subscription. Will update review if/when I hear back from them.",2.0
Mary Michael,Functional,"The app is awesome, I've been using it almost ever since it was created and haven't found any other with such easy to use UI, buuuuut! Over the past couple of years, the app crashes when logging food (when pressing the ""close"" button after pressing done for a meal). I've tried updating it, reinstalling, and have tried it over different phones over the years, but it always crashes on this step, making it extremely hard to use. I hope this gets fixed in future updates...",2.0
Nicholas Thoryk,Functional,"At this time, the app does a lot to help you lose weight and the program works! It's overall pretty gamified which makes things easy for the most part. However, on iOS, you can easily import recipes whereas on Android, there's a 19-step process and there's very little flexibility (the entered recipe doesn't fit into the color coding that other foods do). If you cook a lot of your own food, do not get this app.",2.0
Jeremy Black,Functional,"The Good: If you follow it closely, the program works. Have lost 40+ pounds in 4.5 months. The OK: Some of the content is useful. All of it is corny. Every single lesson has at least one joke, most of which are awful. They become tiresome very quickly. The Awful: Every time I log something, the app freezes and I have to force stop it and open it back up to log another item. What used to take 2-3 minutes now takes 15-20. Reinstalling does not solve it. App has become unstable",2.0
Amy M,Functional,The app shuts down every time I use it. The program itself does not work for me. But I paid for it so may as well continue reading. Some things are a waist of time in the readings. For example when they try to be funny maybe by putting in a ditty. Also the program seems to recap often. It gives you the option to save articles so if I need to recap I can just go look thru saved articles. If I didn't save I can just ask a coach.,2.0
Heidi Riley,Functional,"I think the program is good but their app sucks. You go through all sorts of exercises and submit inputs - like your ultimate goal... and there is no way to see them again to review, revise, update, unless you write it all out externally. Also, currently if you make an error logging an exercise, you can't edit or delete. When logging food, many barcodes don't come up. There is no option to add a recipe.",2.0
ReAnna Adkins,Functional,"For an app that costs so much it's kind of Janky. When I scan bar codes it comes up with incorrect calories or color. Recipes have the wrong picture associated with them. I keep getting notifications that I have a message from my on demand coach, but I can't seem to find them. The app also will not allow me to edit or delete an exercise. All that being said, I have lost a little weight and it is teaching me some tricks and techniques to stay on track.",2.0

You can save a few recipes to your favorites, then it stops working/showing icon to save. Connected my Garmin to track steps and activities which doesn't seem to work either. To log your meals and exercise (things you do several times a day) it takes several clicks and scrolling which is time consuming and they're not named correctly or hard to find.",2.0
John Folk,Functional,"Love the program, app has issues. Frequently when I enter food eaten, the app crashes when I tap close. If I exit and restart, the data is there, but it's super annoying.

A Google user,Functional,"I'm still in my trial and there's a lot of things left to be desired. I can assume my goal specialist and coach has quite a few other clients besides myself, but her responses seem very pre-generated and can take her a while to get back to me.

I love the articles and I think the psychology behind it is sound, but it still needs a lot of work.",2.0
Velvet Jones,Functional,"Would've given a higher rating if I'd done it within the 1st couple of weeks. After the 3rd week they stop the audio on the courses. The audio was very helpful. You could go through the courses while walking, exercising, doing chores, etc. If that feature is brought back, I would give higher rating if it wasn't for that.",2.0
Tom Mahoney,Functional,"They charge full price for an unfinished product. After a certain point there is no audio, which then requires you to read, that might not be an issue for some, but for myself, being able to multitask while listening was great, unfortunately I do not have the time to sit in the app every day and read, also its less inspiring when you have read as opposed to someone speaking to you. Started off great and app worked well for me to the point of having to read, then I found myself never using it.",2.0
Carol Litchfield,Functional,"Just when I really get into this diet, the app fails. This morning it won't even open. My daily tips do not change. Even though it is linked to my fit bit, it never changes my step goal. Noombot is very slow at getting back to me. I've followed all their steps for fixing the app but nothing has worked. One good thing, it's great at counting your calories even if it doesn't save your scanned foods.",2.0
Caity Rinn,Functional,"The program itself is great and helpful. The app leaves a lot to be desired. As others have noted when scanning items, the calories are not correct. As you go along in the lessons you type in answers/your thoughts but it's not saved to go back and look at. For Droid users, there isn't a build a recipe option like there is for iOS. Lastly, I'll add that after lesson 203 there is no audio available. So you get used to audio for 3 weeks then suddenly it's gone. I have shared this all with Noom.",2.0
Rae,Functional,"I love the lessons, and it has worked for me in the past. But my rating is low because of the lack of functionality compared to an iphone. On the iphone app you can create recipes and log them that way, but on android you have to log each individual food item for one serving, which is basically impossible, if you want to get your analysis breakdown. You can't edit previously inputed workouts, you can't zoom out on the weight loss chart. Just a lot of basic features that iphone has.",2.0
SignalNCO,Functional,"I have been using the app on and off for a couple years. I recently started using it again to log meals and try to keep track of my water intake, but have ran into several glitches with the app. It seems to hang up a lot when adding meals and I cannot get the water monitoring to stay turned on. It's actually really frustrating. I hope there is an update soon to fix the issues.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've been using Noom for about four days so my review is based solely on the app itself and not the health/weight loss programs. The app seems to get stuck on a lot of pages, particularly when you are in the help/settings screens. It just freezes.

I've also not been able to get the Noom app and the Noom pedometer app to sync together.",2.0
Caroline Rouwalk,Functional,"I just opened the app to restart Nooming in the New Year. It seems the app is a new version but it's acting super buggy. I've taken my first lesson and it will not advance to the next one no matter if I let the audio lesson finish or advance it manually. I tried to log water, it gets stuck on a blank screen. The only thing that worked for me was logging my breakfast and I hope that data doesn't disappear. I'm all for upgrades but dang, they gotta work if you want people to use this app. ðŸ˜¡",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"There's nothing really special about Noom, and it's definitely not worth a monthly subscription fee. Noom's focus on psychology and building good long-term habits is great, as opposed to simply hammering away on calorie counts. But the basics are often just plain wrong. Many healthy and nutritious foods are scored as ""red"", for example, and calorie budgets can be wildly inaccurate. Your $$ would be much better spent on one or two sessions with a licensed dietician or personal trainer.",2.0
Matt Miller,Functional,"I was digging the app for the most part, but the food logging has always been a little lacking. For instance, it doesn't include macros even though it suggested I go on a Low-Carb or Keto diet. As of this week, the app has been garbage. Things don't load, the app crashes or becomes unresponsive, steps are no longer being tracked for whatever reason, and it's just responding incredibly slow.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I'm going back and forth on this program. I can say that users really need to have the ability to create recipes on android. I have been tracking for 2 weeks now. I've rarely used the red calories. I stay under budget, I have met my steps (which who wouldn't, they're super low), and I've lost 0 pounds. I'm getting a bit discouraged when I step on the scale every morning just to see the same weight. I've already paid good the subscription but really should work on canceling. I've been miserable.",2.0
Kayla Hammond,Functional,I'm so disappointed with the beginning of my free trial. I absolutely love the content of this app (it has so much potential) but the app keeps crashing on my android phone. It keeps glitching when I try to log in my meals and won't work properly. If all of the technical issues were resolved I could absolutely see myself paying for the plan after the trial. Such a bummer.,2.0
Scott Hill,Functional,"Agree with everyone here. The program is great so far and I'll continue to try it, but the app is glitchy and difficult to navigate. It won't show or track my steps. I can't type in my calories for a meal and I have to instead scroll down a long list of numbers (sometimes hundreds or thousands long) until I get to the exact number of calories I want. It can't sync with samsung fit on my galaxy watch so I have to manually enter my fitness numbers. It feels like the app wants me to uninstall.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"The program concept is great, the calorie count is off and options for measuring are limited. I was over my calorie count almost every day, but when I compared the calories to an app I previously had success with, that doesn't have the bells and whistles, I had very different daily calories and the ability to add a variety of exercises, not just steps.",2.0
Tina Best,Functional,"The weight loss program of this app is effective. The app itself is awful. The step counter regularly disconnects from my Fitbit which causes my step goal to go down instead of up even though I am exceeding my goal steps. I have to reconnect it every few days and then start back over with my goal. When logging food, if it happens to be in the system (rare), the calories are almost always wrong and you have to manually manipulate it to log the correct amount of calories. Would not recommend.",2.0
Dawne F,Functional,"bought a full subscription on good faith of the all the 5 star reviews. While the premise was sound, tech support was unable to help me mulitple times with an issue I was experiencing. For the record: you can't install this app on multiple devices & expect it to sync across them. I installed on my tablet for easier reading of articles, and it reset my coursework progress to the beginning. Trying to get it to return to the point I'd been at was a complete song & dance and they still couldn't get it right. Why on earth would you not enable syncing across devices? that's asinine.",2.0
Heather Adams,Functional,"Used to be a great app, but they've stripped most of the features and hidden them behind a pay wall that they claim is a ""free upgrade."" They even shamelessly suggest the most popular choice of payment for the trial is $18.37. Without paying for the supposedly free trial, you can't even see what they mean to charge you for continued use of the ""upgraded"" features. Don't bother downloading if you're looking for a free app.",2.0
Karen Beenken,Functional,"I love the Noom program itself. I'm giving the app 2 stars because on tracking portion sizes, there's no room for flexibility. For example, there's no 1/3 cup increments or an ounces option for so many of the logging items. The GPS tracking for exercise (specifically, biking) doesn't track properly or track calories burned. One feature that would be great to have is a recipe builder, where you can list ingredients, save the recipe, with calories attached, for later use.",2.0
Lynn S,Functional,"Can someone fix the exercise tracking? Can't add exercise history without it populating on today's date. Also, unable to delete exercises, even with following the instructions to go into settings, etc; it's not an option. Since the most recent update/app overhaul, it seems to be more buggy than usual. At times, the app gets glitchy and I have to wait a few hours, or in most cases, a day before I can input my food. The paid version of this isn't really worth it imo.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Pros of Noom: 1) The program actually works and the concept behind it is solid. I have greatly improved the quality of my eating habits and mindfulness towards how and what I eat. 2) The food tracking has helped quite a bit. 3) The app itself is fairly intuitive and easy to use. Cons of Noom: 1) The tone of the writing is irritatingly positive and cheesy, so much so that I couldn't stand doing the daily lessons passed week nine and haven't done one since. It's a shame, because I probably could have learned more and progressed better if the writing was based in reality more, not the feel-good fluffy world of sunshine and rainbows. 2) The coaches are useless. My personal coach did little but ask my own questions back at me, like a bad therapist. The group coach mostly sends out feel-good fluff, which isn't helpful when you have a couple of bad weeks on a plateau. 3) The group wasn't helpful for me. I couldn't relate to almost anyone in my group, as they were all at least 30+ years older, retired, and in a completely different stage of their lives. It's hard to relate your struggles with getting in exercise when you work a full 40-50 hour week to someone that is retired and has all the time in the world. When I asked to change my group, my personal coach dodged the question for weeks and weeks until I just dropped it. 4) The weight chart looks different in Android, and can't be condensed to fully show the peaks and valleys of your wait loss. 5) The pedometer for Android isn't accurate. I often would get home after a busy day of moving around and it would tell me I only walked 70 steps. 6) It's expensive. There are other apps that allow you to track food that are free. Overall, I am grateful for the insight that Noom has given me, but wish that it was better executed. I am almost done with the program and have still not reached my goal weight, and the program's incessant positivity has made me feel guilty for feeling frustrated when I haven't done well. If the developers improved the writing, made it more realistic and empowering instead of forced positivity, that would have helped my journey a great deal. The coaches need work, mine had no positive impact and in fact had a negative impact overall.

Cynthia J Spurr,Functional,"I liked the old app better. This version doesn't allow me to change or remove an exercise after I log it. The sliding bar for calories or time is clunky. An option to enter numbers would be nice. Can't create my own recipes like I did with the older version. I expected to have more items from my Garmin watch sync over, like exercise and water. Unfortunately, it only seems to sync steps and weight sporadically. It's an ok app, but missing features and is less intuitive.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Nice interface. Not helpful if you're not at a point in your life where you can be super goal-oriented. Unfortunately I didn't realize that until Week 4, way past the chance to cancel. If you're dealing with depression or anxiety, choose another program. This program is made up of confusing hastags and abbreviations that are hard to keep up with after the first few weeks. They ask you to rate the goal specialist, but don't change based on ratings.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"In general it's a great idea and it actually work. I like all the tips and tricks etc. However, the personal coach that is supposed to provide the personal touch for the service, had very minimal communication with me, basically just to show that they were there. Not helpful at all. As such, I don't think this app is worth $90 for 2 months. Many other tools out there to count your calories and set goals.",2.0
Anthony So,Functional,About a month in. It's structured so you can't whiz /binge thru lessons and catch up. Youre capped to 1 set of lessons per day. The bookmark feature isn't very intuitive. It's like book marking an entire day and you need to go back to review page by page to determine what it was that you wanted to save. The titles also aren't intuitive of what you saved. Also can't add health plan to mood subscription. I had to create a whole other account and run on second phone to be able to access both.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app has potential, but it seems they rolled it out too soon (more beta testing needed). It doesn't count steps accurately. My coach recommended I just enter my steps by hand, but she and I can't even get that function to work. The tech and coaching support is weak & feels scripted. I really was excited about this program because the concept is terrific, but it just doesn't feel ready for prime time yet. I've cnx'd my trial and will do WW; may try it again later when bugs are fixed.",2.0
Marina Herrera,Functional,"There are a few things I don't like about the app itself. It doesn't sync to my Samsung watch, so I had to pay for another app for that. There's no real accountability for yourself. It's easy to skip a day's reading and not even realize it with the current interface; something as simple a pop up when opening the app would be great. Calorie counts are off in many cases and seem to be rarely updated when reported. Suggestions for new brand foods stay as personal ""recipes."" Program is good.",2.0
Michael Smith,Functional,"Android client is quite buggy and clearly isn't a priority compared to iPhone. Won't let you edit or delete exercise, doesn't credit steps towards calorie count like it does on iPhone. A fix is due in ""several weeks"" which tells me the feature hasn't been deployed yet. The program itself is good and I give it four stars. The Android client gets one star.",2.0
Crystal Furness,Functional,"The app is NOT good. It's the one part of the program that is making me give up. The calorie counts are not accurate when compared to packaging, the barcode scanner does NOT work on most products, the steps don't sync (yes, I followed all directions to fix) the coach is ho-hum & I paid for this frustration. The psychology is an important part of the process, but the FREE version of Fitbit is easier & functions properly.. The premium version, with support & guidance is better & cheaper.",2.0
Avarie F,Functional,"My review is based primarily on my experience of the program itself. I was interested in something that would help me learn a healthier relationship with food by focusing on portion sizes and food choice through the green-yellow-red system and CBT techniques.

Whilst innoculous, if I'm paying for a premium service it just makes the product look sloppy. Recipes also are very unorganised.",2.0
Brandy Stephens,Functional,I subscribed to noom a little more than 2 years ago and it was great. I had very good success. I gained a few pounds so I decided to try it again.

I lose data, have lost progress, and have been put on a course more than once. The other downfall is with tracking food. You can't build recipes and then portion them out. If one of the main pillars is about learning to eat more mindfully, the app's design should reflect that. Customer service has been quick, but explanations haven't always been intuitive.",3.0
Joseph Chouinard,Functional,"Overall it's good, There's just a couple pain points that I hope get addressed. First, the barcode scanner is really bad at focusing on the barcode, it always seems to auto-focus on the background, which makes it hard to scan foods. Secondly, for me, the app never launches properly when clicking on their step tracking widget, it just shows a white screen with the noom logo. And lastly, the food serving sizes are often wrong given the calories or vise versa. Just need to be careful when entering.",3.0
Josh S,Functional,"A very good program with (so much) room for improvement in the app. Pros: The program actually works if you commit to it. Bite sized information. Cons: The app is broken, glitches changing my location in the program. The default calorie goal it gave me was CRAZY HIGH. Quick fix: calculate your own, and adjust your age up until you get a reasonable calorie goal. Accountability buddies didn't work. It is clear that some features were removed/scaled back, coaches for example... I have a coach?.",3.0
Jessi,Functional,"The program is good. I have lost weight and I enjoy the lessons and moving through the courses. The app, however, is terrible. For a couple of weeks it was stuck on my course progress and would not let me advance. That was fixed but now it will not load AT ALL, even after uninstalling and reinstalling. The media feature constantly shows up in the background when I never use it. I extended my free trial but when that's done I will not be paying so much money for an app that doesn't work.",3.0
Shelly Gordon,Functional,"I was on the program for a year to lose weight and that part was great. I have been officially off for about 4 months but continue to weigh in weekly, exercise, and track calories with the app. I'm happy to say I'm maintaining my goal weight. The app itself has a lot of technical glitches that could be improved. For example, the pedometer is connected to my Fitbit, but it hardly ever transfers my steps correctly and sometimes not at all. This has been a consistent problem from the start.",3.0
Angela Shaw,Functional,"The program itself is wonderful. I've been doing Noom for just over a year and have lost weight and have become more mindful in my approach to food. The app is horrible! It reset my articles back to the very beginning without warninh. Nothing we have tried so far to fix it has worked. Additionally, the sync with Fitbit is hit or miss on the steps and weight. There was only one time it did a sync with my blood pressure monitor and about half of the foods/meals I saved are missing.",3.0
Renee Booth-Petty,Functional,"It's okay for the most part. But it doesn't track other movements besides exercise and 'custom' is so vague. Choices of food is limited and cannot add proper ingredients or measurements. The step counter does not work regardless of the choice made. Paying for services when the app doesn't work really is subpar. If it doesn't get fixed, I will cancel EVERYTHING and do something else that actually works.",3.0
Olivia Hult,Functional,"This worked great for a few months-I think the program, education, and support is great! My issue is with the technical side of things. There's no desktop option and I can't log in on my new device. I got a new phone, tried logging out of the app on my old phone, but couldn't find anywhere to do so, so I just deleted the app on there when setting up my new phone. I've now been trying for three days to access my account and I cannot! It tells me it's logging me in, but then gets stuck loading!",3.0
Annee Mchughes,Functional,"The concept of Noom is very good as a psychology/health based program. Some of the app isn't intuitive. When logging foods, there isn't always an accurate option to choose from the list, so one has to figure out calories/servings/cups yourself. No option to create recipes. If you make your own recipe often, like stew, beans, etc., you can't save it for future logging. Also needs computer option. I like that it has a step tracker. Needs more exercise options.",3.0
Maria Leonardi,Functional,"Great user experience and was great at getting me going in the beginning. I like the incorporation of the course journey but found it repetitive and also frustrating that it didn't keep track of prior goal text entries. The biggest downfall for me is the lack of integration with other fitness apps (weight and fitness tracking), the incomplete database of accurate food, and the lack of focus on nutrition in the food color coding system. For expense I don't think this can compete with other option",3.0
k k,Functional,"The caloric density, and the daily calorie budget and weigh ins have so far been pretty effective. I've been steadily losing weight. The calorie tracking could definitely use some improvements to make things easier though. The recipes in the meal plan didn't appeal to me so I've been entering what I eat manually, ingredient by ingredient. This is _extremely_ time consuming and tedious. Would be great if you could save regular meals in a personal database so that they can be easily reused.",3.0
Dana Bean,Functional,"I love the motivational CBT program and that noom encourages me to eat more fruits and vegetables. That said, I'm investing so much time tracking my food and I can't even track/see information that I need, like sodium and protein intake. The app itself is clunky and has a dearth of features; ie, once I enter exercise I can't delete it, and there is no ability to copy meals that I eat often. MyFitnessPal is a far better app in absolutely every way. I just wish I could combine the two!",3.0
Jordyn Crum,Functional,"I can't save recipes, and this makes it incredibly difficult and time consuming to document what I'm actually eating. The recommended recipes don't provide a lot of options that sound good to me. It's also frustrating that I don't get credit for the day if I skip breakfast. I also don't like reminders that say ""looks like you missed lunch"" when I just haven't eaten yet. The ""oh noez"" makes me cringe. I think it has a great foundation, and it is very motivating and educational. It needs work.",3.0
Mark,Functional,Overall a good health app! The food color system is handy and helps me make better choices. The lessons are also easy to apply and digest (ha! food puns). However the meal tracking could use some updates imo. I would like to see an option to track more in-depth info like macros and other nutrition info. You also cannot edit workouts after logging them. Having to put my meals in another app to track my macros is a pain.,3.0
Mandana Mostofi,Functional,"Initially really liked it. But the quality of courses reduced overtime, towards the end, there were just reviews in AI voices, which was disappointing. The logging you can do elsewhere for cheaper. It helped me lose some weight initially, which was very encouraging, but I never hit my goal so my conclusion is that adjusting diet is not enough.",3.0
stef f,Functional,"Wanted to learn about nutrition, but they are only focused on ""caloric density"" and not things like macros or sodium. Food logging system was meh, it was easy to search and add items, but logging multiple meals at once was a pain since you had to go in and out of the pop up for each meal. You also had to make sure you restart the app every day because otherwise it wouldn't advance to the next day. The ""lessons"" felt like they were just trying to sell the program to you, had no info on nutrition",3.0
Robert,Functional,"Uses for almost 1 year. Overall great reading material, calorie counting and database severely lacking. I feel one of the big cornerstones of this app besides the psychological part of the reading is being able to count your calories. I constantly run in to numerous foods with wrong calories, missing all together and barcodes that don't scan. Their is an option to report it but at the price you pay it should be better. Free apps have better databases. Fix it. Thanks!",3.0
Laura Cleveland,Functional,"I'm having the same exact issues as A Millard's review on 8/21. I have done all the suggestions given to me- hard stopped app, restarted, uninstalled/reinstalled, nothing is working. I was up to lessons 301 when my app stopped working and brought me back to 101. I haven't had a new lesson in close to 2 weeks. This is a big part of why I joined this program. I've now lost momentum It's very discouraging ðŸ˜ž. Next step is asking for a refund and on to something else. (Android user)",3.0
Rianna Tibbets,Functional,While I like using noom the app is giving me some issues. The main thing is how I turned off all notifications and almost all permissions and the media player still pops up on my phone. It's so freaking annoying. I use my headphones for Spotify almost all day at work and if noom pops up as a media player I can't use my headphones to control anything I have to use my phone. And I have no idea how to get it to stop. If this issue gets resolved this will fix 90% of my issues with the app,3.0
rickz711,Functional,"There's no interface to Samsung Health, so I can't sync steps and other health data. There's something called ""System Pedometer"" that presumably uses steps recorded by my phone, but most of the time I don't have my phone on me, so it's not useful at all to me. Noom supports Fitbit and several less well-known fitness tracker apps, but not Samsung. This is a big deal for me, and means I likely won't continue with the program when the current subscription ends.",3.0
Deborah Slavik,Functional,"I would like to see improvement in some of the features, such as a way to save favorite meals to make logging quicker, add the macros content so that we have the option to see those numbers even though I realize we are just tracking color food categories, improved communication from coaches (my last contact was months ago after having continued contact up to that point) and maybe a little celebration of each milestone weightloss wouldn't hurt! Otherwise I've done okay on the program.",3.0
C,Functional,"It's a good app with good information however it is very expensive. My main problem is out of the blue, I was charged nearly $100 for a premium subscription that I didn't agree to. I only ever agreed to a regular subscription. Luckily, getting a refund was very simple and very fast, with very responsive customer service, so I didn't actually end up losing the money.",3.0
kyle toca,Functional,"It's very overpriced for what it is, the modules are helpful, but get somewhat redundant over time. After the took away personal coaches, the price was insanely difficult to justify. There are a variety of apps that give you more insight and have better functions like lifesum or cronometer, both have huge benefits at a fraction of the cost. Also when you try to cancel your subscription you get bombarded with discounts that make you question why you paid the $200 in the first place.",3.0
Penny Bedard,Functional,"It's an OK app. Needs a few improvements. Like being able to track in advance, not the day of, for an event coming up! Not having to finish tracking on 1 meal and then having to go back to the beginning and start again to track the next meal. The steps counting does not work well at all, but I do my own thing. Overall, I have adjusted to the app. I'm making it work for me. I do really ENJOY the daily lessons. Those are a plus! Thank you! ðŸ˜Š",3.0
Amanda Hurley,Functional,"I kept feeling like I was missing features on the app. After reading up on FAQs and reddit, it's clear that the android version has missing components to it. Wonder if the price is reflective of that compared to ios. I don't have an option to enter steps. I've tried syncing with garmin connect, but it doesn't work. Features randomly appear and disappear. I have tried reinstalling, but that hasn't changed anything. I'm still in my 2 week trial. May cancel if the app still sucks.",3.0
Sherri C,Functional,"This app has so much potential. Areas it could improve: the food diary is limited. If it could import from MyFitnessPal, that would be great. I like to enter my food at the end of the day. Going in and out of every meal is cumbersome. #2 I would like to go back to previous lessons without having to scroll through every week. Also, I would like to browse and see my prior answers and not have to redo them when revisiting the lesson. Mostly I didn't have writing journal 1st time looking at lesson",3.0
Edward McKenna,Functional,"At first, I was impressed by the app, because it taught me a lot about the psychology of weight loss & diet & I enjoyed listening to the speakers. But after about three weeks of using the app, I realized that the audio was AI generated & that ruined the experience for me. I can't justify paying $180 every quarter, because it feels cheap now. Also, I felt deceived by the app. I thought that the speakers were real humans at first, but then they switched to AI without notice. This could be 5 stars",3.0
Christopher Knauf,Functional,"This is a great app. I like the lessons and calorie tracking mixed with other third party apps. However, two things frustrate my experience. The first thing, slightly annoying, is that I accidentally skip lessons and I'm too dumb to figure out how to scroll back, if we can, without first saving it. The second thing is, of all the barcode scanners I've tried, Noom uses the worst. I sometimes need to flatten the item on a solid surface to get tge scanner to pick up items. It's pricy, but worth it.",3.0
B A,Functional,"6/22: Love Noom, but... for some time, I've been having trouble with the step count. Sometimes out of nowhere, it reverts to a 0, and I need to manually enter it. Sometimes it sticks; sometimes it doesn't. Lately, though, added to that problem is that my calorie budget is seemingly randomly jumping all over the place. After many months of its being at 1200 calories/day, now it's up down and all around. 4/22:Helpful and well designed app. Makes doing the program a lot easier.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The program is a 5 out of 5. I've lost over 40lbs  in 5.5 months The Coaches are great.  The App is great for tracking your calories. I would have rated this a 5, but the pedometer is just broken. I've restarted the app, restarted the phone, updated the app each time there's an update in hopes that it will be fixed, but still won't track steps properly. For me, this has definitely gotten worse with each update.   Fortunately, I have a watch/phone through Samsung health which tracks my exercise, steps, floors, etc.   At different times of the day I am forced to manually sync what's on my watch/phone with what's in the app.   I've read multiple threads on the net over the months with people having the same issue.   Would it stop me from using the app or the program, NO! But step tracking is a large part of the program's mission, so it's something that I would think they would place a high priority on. I'm not sure if they don't run into this issue with their emulators, or there is no way to truly recreate steps in the emulator, but it would be great if they finally could fix it.   But aside from that: Noom has worked for me!!!!",3.0
C L,Functional,"The program is great. Cognitive behavior to create lifestyle changes works & the ability to connect with others in the program is a terrific support mechanism. However, the app itself has a lot of issues. Its ability to sync with fitness apps to coordinate steps & exercise is wanting-it worked at first, now I have to do it manually. The food log can be frustrating. I have pretty much the same food each morning yet I have to scroll through an entire list to add items. Kind of disappointing.",3.0
Pam Quinn,Functional,"I love the Noom program & have had great success in losing weight. I've lost 41 pounds since April. I'm now 5 pounds away from my goal weight. The support from the coaches & team members is helpful too! The app however, isn't the best & the new update is really bad. Things keep disappearing from my drop down menu, some of the food colors aren't correct & it's very glitchy. The new weight graph is horrible! You can't see any numbers. Very frustrating! Please change it back!",3.0
Jamie Knight,Functional,"The articles and flow of the courses is good and the ability to track food plus exercise is good. I don't find the coach feature very helpful, and I've found numerous errors in the food logging portion. (There's a way to report the errors but who knows if they're actually being fixed - I haven't seen anything changed yet.) Overall, I have lost weight while using the app and I am learning new tips through the articles.",3.0
Jay Gengelbach,Functional,"I'm conflicted on a score for the app. On the one hand, the weight loss program is solid and effective (at least in my first two months; ask again in a year). But the app itself is kind of a mess. The meal logging feature is full of incorrect data, the main page often fails to load without some extra prodding, and there are obvious display bugs. As a large man, it initially calculated my calorie budget almost 1,000 too low, which was demotivating. I'm sticking with it, but it still needs work.",3.0
Jill Jones,Functional,"I really wanted to like it. The articles were helpful (though maybe had a little too much filler). I like the concept of tracking green, yellow and red food but its too detailed (does anyone remember Noom from like 10 years ago? It was so simple and great!). Despite all of that, I do feel like it had good tools and could work. But the app dies on me everyday. I cant fix it by closing the app or restarting my phone. I need to uninstall and reinstall every time. It just spins and spins. Useless.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I actually love and am having success with the program itself, but the experience on a Pixel 3 has not been great. This is one of a few apps I have that I have to try opening several times before succeeding, sometimes force stopping it or restarting my phone to get it to work. It looks great when it works, but it just doesn't a lot of the time. Also, some of the lessons and my coach have referenced features that aren't on Android, which has caused confusion. I still like it, but it's frustrating.",3.0
Shawn Sandlin (EvilBetty),Functional,"Changing my review from 5 stars to 3. The program itself is fantastic and it works. The app used to have such a clean visual aesthetic. The app was recently updated with mismatched, hard-to-read fonts. Long answer choices on some quizzes run off the screen making them difficult to complete. The interface looks unprofessional now. A real step backwards in my opinion.",3.0
Andrew Floyd,Functional,"The program itself is great, I've made many lifestyle changes and have lost a good amount of weight so far, but the app itself is less than desirable. My wife is doing the program with me, but she has an iPhone and her app is years ahead of the Android version. She can create and save recipes with portion sizes, has a better weight loss graph and adjusting tools. Her steps integrate automatically, etc. I can't figure out why one version would be so far behind the other. It's frustrating.",3.0
Merrill Aldrich,Functional,"After a few weeks the program is working well. I'm down two inches and about 14 lbs, without a lot of sacrifice or discomfort. The app functions well purely from a utilitarian standpoint, but the UI is sort of C+. Lots and lots of room for improvement in user experience. The training pieces have great info but are compromised by grating, too frequent attempts at humor that fall flat. Still, results!",3.0
Alexis Yakle,Functional,"I really like the app, but as of late there have been lots of glitches. The calorie count for exercise doesn't change as you move the amount of time for some exercises, but does for others. Right now, my first article keeps flashing to a different title every second or so. Occasionally, I can click an article, but it won't let me into the second one, and that ruins the streak and doesn't let me get the info I need for this journey. I've tried in/reinstalling, but it isn't working this time.",3.0
Miguel,Functional,"The program is great but the app isn't. It freezes often, the scanner isn't very good, and the color coding isn't always accurate (a food you manually looked up can show as green but red when you scan the item or the other way around). Also, if you accidentally enter an exercise you can't edit or delete it, which means you'll mistakenly be allowed more calories that day. But overall, it still does the job.",3.0
Frances Bowman,Functional,"The learning aspect is very good and enjoyable. The weight loss and exercise goals are realistic and doable. Logging of meals and weight is easy. I like the social media group, too. Only negative so far: The coaching is limited to weekly check-ins with quick questions, which seems robotic to me. Edit in 2022: I got very close to goal and then the app kept freezing, so I am going to cancel my subscription. I wanted to keep going, but it is too frustrating now.",3.0
Rhonda Dievert,Functional,"The food tracker is pretty awful ðŸ˜•, mostly inaccurate and difficult to use. My coach taught me to save favorite meals which helps. I like the color-coded food concept. Lessons are good, but fast-paced. I would like to use a strategy a few days/week before the next one. I liked that they read the lesson to you early on, but that stopped after a couple weeks. I like the coach & group coaching- very helpful. I am down several pounds after a couple months, which is better than I had been doing.",3.0
Tam Braddy,Functional,"Took advantage of the free trial and it was incredibly helpful. You are able to track calories and weight, log meals, has a built in pedometer, and my favorite part, help grasp a true understanding of your eating habits. A definite game changer when it comes to weight loss apps/programs. My only peeve is that you don't receive reminders when your trial is about to end so you're likely to be charged for the full program and it was difficult to say the least to reach someone in customer service.",3.0
Kat T,Functional,"it's an OK app so far, but a few things annoy me. like it would be great to filter recipes based on low calorie or high green options instead of scrolling and having to see everything. also, when adding food, it's so frustrating to add a food and having to scroll all the way to the amount of calories it is. I'd rather just type in the amount. plus, when you go off track like gain weight, there's nothing to tell you ""like hey what's going on or are you ok""",3.0
Joan Horst,Functional,"When they switched to a symbol for the app itself I could not find it on my phone at first. Then within the app, the symbols are also more muted. I am a visual person so this does not work as well for me. Sometimes there is too much reading and too many quizzes. This is a turn off. I liked the first set where you could hear it audibly read, which worked well with getting ready for work. I also am noticing the app freezing more since the change to muted colors.",3.0
Joe Sechrist,Functional,"The content is fantastic and I'm getting great results by logging meals and weighing in daily. Unfortunately, loading up previous meals or creating a recipe is a bit of a chore. I'd also like to be able to just type in values instead of scrolling when it comes to adding meals themselves. This especially gets in the way when it's easy to swipe up and cancel out the input menu as you're scrolling to the calorie value for the meal.",3.0
Lori Horsman,Functional,"So many typos in articles. Food log is terrible. Many foods not in there. Many that are in there, have the wrong calorie amount. Navigating food log is frustrating. To add more than one meal at a time, you have to go into first meal, then click all the way out and then go back into the second meal. Android users don't have full capabilities but pay the same. For example, you cannot add recipes. I have lost weight and learned a lot. Coach/groups give support and they help keep you accountable.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Navigation could be improved with more liberal use of 'back' arrows, instead of having to start over from home. The food database is filled with duplicates, each with different nutritional data. They're not screening entries, and it's going to get worse if they don't get a handle on this. The pedometer ticks off steps while you're driving! The app should be better, to justify the program's price.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"This app/program has been life changing! There are a couple of things I would make more intuitive in the app, but overall it runs smoothly and the app coach is helping change my relationship with food. Edit: As soon as I reviewed this the app crashed! first time though, so not terrible. I also wanted to add that I would like more interaction with my goal specialist. It isn't really one on one help as advertised, but the group is a great and supportive online community.",3.0
Michael Young,Functional,"Love Noom. The app is mediocre. Great for reading the articles, but the food tracking has some limitations. About 20% of the foods that I have entered have the wrong calories. I can circumvent this by calculating the calories. Also, the scanner can be finicky and sometimes return ""Cannot be found"" one time, then finds the ite. the next time. On the plus side, they have a lot more brands than I was expecting. Despite the above the app is functional & helpful. I would highly recommend Noom.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"For the most part I like this app, however it would be much better with a workbook component that can be saved. The app has you fill in goals, but then I immediately forget what they are and have no way to retrieve them. Also I like the scientific research concepts, but sometimes you're introduced to way too much at once and it's easily forgotten. I would rather have a couple of concepts per week than several per day. Also the weight graph needs the ability to zoom out and see larger time period.",3.0
Tracy Walker,Functional,"I love the green/yellow /red categories. Learned almost nothing on the lessons, learned a lot from the color breakdown. Never went past the trial period, as the app did not allow for recording your own recipes - you can enter calorie count, that's it. Not even in the premium version. Big deal breaker for me. Switched to MyFitnessPal which isn't as good at tracking types of food, but allows easy import of recipes.",3.0
Polly McCall,Functional,"Program is excellent! But, there are issues with this app. First of all, from a technical capability perspective, it doesn't do a lot of things that other apps do, or they do them in a much less intuitive way. Saving personal recipes, being able to plan ahead (past just today), identifying red, yellow, green foods from the search screen would all be very helpful. On a non-technical note, your illustrations are not very diverse! Nearly all feature pink skin and feminine-coded characters.",3.0
Cheetah Runner,Functional,"Really wish this app had better pricing options, you are charged quite a bit for 8 months at a time. I had to contact support because my pricing actually went up $50 from what I signed up for because the month changed. They did fix it, but guaranteed that's what makes people turn away. I like the actual program, I haven't lost weight yet but feel like I'm learning a lot and motivated.",3.0
Marcia Vannet,Functional,"I like the little lessons. I like the coach. Some aspects of the food logging are great, but the database is terrible. Hardly anything has the calories that the package says. I think the calories are too restrictive, and the goal of 10000 steps is not supported by research. Also, there is clearly more to classifying foods than a simple equation, and they are secretive about that. Finally, it should not take months to add a food to the database.",3.0
Amber Goodspeed,Functional,"I really like the Noom program, but this app is awful. It crashes constantly, and it's so frustrating. I've tried re-installing but almost every day, I open the app to just a blank screen. It only works about half the time. I would also really like to be able to enter food, exercise through a desktop version. I often get notifications about messages, but there's no where to see them in the app. I do think the model is valuable, but the app issues make it difficult for me to recommend.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"this app is fairly easy to use. However, the step count does work correctly. There we even products that weren't listed and even some were wrong.

A Google user,Functional,"I enjoyed this app initially, however the actual app is very large, slow and often crashes. I like the concept and the layout of the app, but the mapping tool for exercise crashed my phone completely and i had to uninstall the app in order for my phone to function again. I have tried a few other weight loss program and I like this one very much, however I think for the long term, I would switch to something free.   I want to download my input from the app, but there is no computer version. You have to have the app installed to input data, update information, or even cancel a subscription. I wish this app was smaller in size, and didn't run so slow. Also, I don't benefit from the group updating portion. That just made me feel behind.   Another issue I had, is that you have to be online to use the app, so if you are out on a multi day hike, you won't be able to track your meals or workouts.",3.0
Laura Lawrence,Functional,"The food logging is very frustrating. Editing the product information (company changed recipe) is unavailable. The bar code scanner doesn't seem compatible with my phone (Samsung S20). The scanner has a clear picture at about a foot away, when moved closer to scan, it goes out of focus and stays that way. Also, when you're in a lesson, you can't go back a page. If you want to reread the last page you have to start the lesson over. Yes, it's only a couple of pages, but it's annoying.",3.0
Echo Gregg,Functional,"The concept of this app is good. However, it is frustrating when they ask you to spend approx. 10 mins a day on the app and most of the time I'm sifting through their food database trying to get the barcode reader to work or constantly flagging items that are the wrong calorie value. By that time, I'm annoyed and find it a chore to read the articles. It gets a little easier once you've logged a bit bc the app remembers your inputs. I've lost almost 5 lbs in 3 weeks so I'll stick with it for now.",3.0
Benjamin J Marley,Functional,"So far I've been impressed. It really does give a lot of helpful info and encouragement. Edit: It became clear shortly after my initial review that the goal specialist is really more like a weekly check-in specialist.

Nolan Wheeler,Functional,"The rating is not for the courses and content, it's for the programs and app itself.

The barcode scanner is nearly useless and the app doesn't adjust your allowable calories once you've achieved your weight target. The weight graph sucks as well. You can't change the time frame displayed, only scroll left/right. I did meet my goals though!",3.0
Judi D,Functional,"I was really enjoying the Noom experience until my app crashed for a second time, the first time my coach was able to reset my progress. But on May 21, it crashed for the second time. My app is the current version, the tech people say they are working to resolve the issue. My progress on the lessons went from about 302 back to day one, 3.5 months gone. The daily lessons were one of my favorite things about Noom. I hope it get fixed soon.",3.0
Tina B.,Functional,"Let me start by saying I LOVE the Noom program itself. But, the app leaves much to be desired on a lot of levels, particularly for Android users. The food database has been very inaccurate on several occasions. There are features missing for the Android version of the app such as creating custom recipes to log, add-on functionality won't work for me, etc. Additionally, the UI requires you to have to click multiple times to get back to certain screens. It could use a lot of improvement.",3.0
E H (ch33kyskunk),Functional,"The app is surprisingly easy to navigate and use. I do like the daily reminders. However, I can't use the recipes! A phone in the kitchen is a disaster and there is no option to print these out. I would love a feature that let's us print these. Otherwise I feel like I'm stumbling when logging foods, only discovering their usefulness AFTER logging them.",3.0
Laura Lincks,Functional,"I absolutely loved the coursework and will consider doing it again in the future. But the meal tracking (at least on Android) was the deal breaker for me. There's no way to add customized recipes and seemingly no way to have an added item show red, yellow and green ranges of the food if it's not in the database. If the app gets a better... A much better... Meal tracker in place I'll be back.",3.0
Mary Beth Witkop,Functional,"I am enjoying the psychological aspect of the program. The visual color food charts is great and I am learning a lot from the tasks. It has been extremely helpful to help me change my way of thinking. However the app and some of the program needs work. The pedometer does not track my steps accurately which is frustrating. I also see notifications which i guess are automated from my Coach but don't get to read them because they aren't in the chat. Also, the Coach interaction is a bit lacking.",3.0
Mark Klass,Functional,"I really like the program but the app is very clunky! My weight goal was way off from the start and I was told they ""couldn't fix it from their end"" and I've had the same ""Tip of the Day"" for weeks. If everything was based on the oerformance of the app, I would really give a bad review but the program is very helpful and works to keep you motivated to stay with the program and the information it provides helps you understand how and why you gained weight and identify ways to change your future.",3.0
Jonathan Law,Functional,"The process itself has been helpful. It wasn't anything ""new"" to me but it was good to have one place that was prodding me to be mindful and track things. Thhe app itself is frustrating. I manually close and restart a few times to get it to load. I wish there was a manual input option for calories instead of a scroll wheel (scrolling to the 300s...). Also, the Android version of this app has fewer functions full stop. You can't put in a whole recipe and portion it out like on the iphone.",3.0
Dassi L,Functional,"I really like the program. The lessons are helpful and tracking my progress helps me make healthier choices. But the android app is extremely glitchy. The app freezes and crashes my phone at least once per day. Logging food can be a challenge because the database sometimes decides not to load and you can't add your own custom recipies. I also felt like the coach was pretty obsolete. I got one message from him maybe once a day. Overall: good program, bad app.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Like the program, but hate the app! There needs to be a companion desktop site to make logging food and reading the articles easier. Noom claims you just need 10 minutes a day to use this app, but that's not the case when every time you press the the back arrow or key, you're redirected to the home page. This app would be much better if you could go back one screen instead of waiting for the home screen to load each time.",3.0
Bridget Nicholson,Functional,"Update: After finally installing and setting up the app, it works well and I do like it; however, the step tracker is supposed to sync with my fitbit but it does not. I've gone through the series 3 times to set up my customized course and it keeps erroring out. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and when I log in each time, I can't get through this part of the app to actually use the app. Very frustrating.",3.0
Jamie P,Functional,"I like the app and how easy it is to use. I don't like that so many foods are either the wrong color, or the calories are off. Also the scanner to scan the barcodes needs some work. It rarely ever works, because it hardly ever focuses. Also, if you type in a food (on some foods) you get one color and if you scan the barcode, you get a different color. They need to update the food lists and add more as well. It would also be helpful to add a recipe builder to build your own recipe",3.0
Jessica L. Anne,Functional,"I like the information and it is effective, but man, I really wish there was a desktop/browser dashboard too. Not being able to access the info when I can sit at my desk and read it is beyond frustrating. Don't get me started on the food tracking - it's generic and I find that I can't track calories accurately, sometimes a couple hundred calories a day because I can't enter in a food that isn't already in the database and have to find something comparable. I get that the focus isn't hyper micro-managing and learning to have a different relationship with food, which is working for me, but the process would be a lot less vague and I feel a lot more effective if some accuracy were lended to the process. It's just weird that these two things, computer access and more accurate food tracking, aren't a priority for Noom. Not entirely sure I will be renewing if some of this isn't addressed in the updates.",3.0
Kat Hovanec,Functional,"Program is great but the app sucks. Weight loss is a psychology and accountability thing which works for many, including me. I love it. The app constantly has issues. Won't load properly, issues with logging food. It's just steadily had more bugs in the last few weeks. And there are huge differences between the iOS and Android OS that make it seem like the Android one is an afterthought that nobody wanted but had to have.",3.0
Diana Reynolds,Functional,"Overall the Noom program is great. I learn something new every day, I'm eating better, losing weight, getting fit again. HOWEVER, the app itself has glitches that are aggravating. I manually enter my activities (because Fitbit activity does not automatically sync), but they don't show up in Noom. The first couple of days on the program I was able to see my list of activities, but after that nothing showed up. I have uninstalled several times with no success. Really irritating.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Good for beginners, but very likely to get a surprise charge for $173 after your trial to prepay for 8 months. They do warn you in the confirmation email. If you're new to weightloss it would be helpful but if you've used other weight loss programs you've probably already heard a lot of it. The calorie goal it automatically set was WAY too low, and the food database doesn't have a lot of things. You can use a free food diary app and their groups to get the same effect.",3.0
Patricia Larsen,Functional,"I really like this program and the content a lot and think it's going to be the most successful for me for weight loss! However, the app is not working with my phone and as such isn't counting my steps and the messages keep glitching. I also need to be able to input recipes to see what the calorie count would be and there isn't an option for that. I love everything else!",3.0
Abby Reynolds,Functional,"I really like Noom, the program. Seriously, it's fabulous. However, their app is buggy. I frequently have problems getting the right step count (for the past week it has refused to log any steps). The food diary constantly freezes. I'll have days where the food diary doesn't even show up, so I can't log anything. Same with the weight log. It's very frustrating and a bit of a deterrent from using Noom.",3.0
Ashley Sunde,Functional,"The app itself works very well and I have not encountered any glitches to date. The psychology aspect of this program is awesome and I love it, although I would maybe reordersome of the lessons. However, my love quickly dwindles after that. I am not a fan of how the food log is set up and I am really irritated by not being able to edit recipes after they are logged, or not being able create and save my own. I have also encountered A LOT of inaccurate calorie info, even when scanning barcodes.",3.0
Anne Bingham,Functional,"The program is great. The help I've received in changing my thinking has been invaluable and will help me the rest of my life with healthy habits. The app itself is ok, not super user-friendly and lacks a place to journal or record thoughts. Even places where I've written down goals within the lessons don't save, so I can't go back and review what I wrote. Also, the groups are confusing to navigate and sometimes my posts are erased as soon as I hit send.",3.0
James Frye,Functional,"I want to start by saying that Noom has helped me to lose weight and I intend to continue using the app because I am continuing to find success with it. But, I would not recommend Noom in its current state. I expierience daily freezes and crashes while reading the courses, which is annoying because the app loads slowly when I restart it. The courses are also missing an option to go back to the previous page.",3.0
Eline Pierre,Functional,"The app is for beginners. Individuals who don't understand how the mind, emotions, and environment impact what you eat can benefit a lot. The ability to track your food, calories, water, and exercise is beneficial to all. However, the tracker needs improvement because if you make a mistake in logging something incorrectly, you can't correct it. You have to start over.",3.0
Debbie Terwilliger,Functional,Program is good. App not so much. Only 4 days in and I've had to reinstall it. Features that worked yesterday don't work today. Very frustrating. However important features do work so it does not impede my progress. I will give their technical support five stars however they are extremely responsive and friendly and definitely skilled. I imagine popularity of this program might be putting just a little bit of strain on resources.,3.0
Donna Babineaux,Functional,"The idea behind the app is great. Android users do not have the same features as Apple users. There are a lot of discrepencies with calories. The step counter is extremely inaccurate and when you correct it manually, it doesnt always save. One would think that with what you are paying, you would have a top notch product but in many ways, it is lacking!",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The service is great, honestly. It's helping me lose weight and keep it off. The APP, on the other hand, is terrible. The iOS version is very polished. The Android version is not updated to support the notch on the 3XL and I had to restrict its usage in the background because it has been causing rather severe battery drain on my device.",3.0
Kerrie Box,Functional,"In the last few days i have been inputting my water, exercise and weight however when you look at the front page ie 6 of 8 glasses of water it says zero.. but if you click on any one of those it shows task complete. I like to be able to do a quick glance to mare sure i am on task. I updated my app, but it idnt change anything, thats why i change rate from 5 to 3 stars. very insightful, easy to use. it does take some time, if your serious about it, it is well worth the time and money.",3.0
Connie Shemo,Functional,"There are a lot of good things about the app. It helps me keep track of the calories, as long as I eat popular pretty standard foods. It's hard to figure out when I go to a good Chinese restaurant, for example. But it's really frustrating when some of my friends hs e features that I don't have on mine. I have an ""accountability buddy"" who can share her daily food analysis with me but I can't share back with her. It makes the whole app seem kind of chaotic that they're taking features away.",3.0
Katie Babcock,Functional,"The new update is awful. The app frequently will not load or lags really bad. The fonts are hard to read. I also wish they allowed dark mode. I don't like the white screen and gray font at all. As far as the program, it's a common sense calorie deficit plan. I didn't feel like I gained any special insight about nutrition. I did like that it does focus on habits, so occasionally I find a neat tip or trick to help with habits, but not enough to justify the cost of the app.",3.0
Ali Hallman,Functional,"Great app with lots of bite-sized information, teaching, motivation, and help. I appreciate the personal coach and discussion group. There are a few weaknesses however that are affecting the experience for me... If you get behind, there's no way to pause the app so you can catch up. Also there's no searchable database for the information presented in the articles, so if you don't bookmark something you will have to search through multiple days with multiple articles with multiple pages.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I do like many of the aspects of Noom. However, there are several areas that can be better. For example, instead of having to save an entire article, it would be nice if there was a place I could click on to actually see the goals/decisions I personally made. Also, enough with the acronyms. If you are go to use SO many of them, at least insert a link, or at list a definition if I hover on the letters. I really like how Noom presents scientific information and LOVE using the sliding weight ruler.",3.0
SJ the NERD,Functional,"Great advice, but very fast paced. Within the first month of using Noom I lost 11 lbs. The color system makes tracking food easier, the recipes are great, and I think overall I've learned better eating habits. I do feel that the lessons are very fast paced though. There's a lot to take it. You'll learn about a new aspect of health, say mindfulness, and it'll challenge you to be more aware of this, then the next day it's, ""now that you've mastered mindfulness..!"" I haven't though ðŸ¤·â€",3.0
Jillian Morgan,Functional,"Just like eveyone else has said, it's a really solid exercise plan. I've been super successful with it, but the app has loads of problems and no way to connect to apps (like MyFitnessPal) that do those features better. My starting calorie budget for each day fluctuates wildly, making it hard to stay on plan, the food database is severely lacking and there's no way to enter recipes. It's a great plan, but the app needs a ton of help.",3.0
Rosie Cressall,Functional,I really love the group coaching and support group. The articles are really helpful. But I really hate the food logging and calorie info. Anyone can add something to it so there are a lot of inaccuracies. You have to look at the packaging for everything you eat to make sure your calorie count is right which defeats the purpose of having that part of the app.,3.0
Abhaya Keir,Functional,Hey I'm 16 and just wondering if I can actually use this app as I tried setting up an account and noticed that the lowest age you guys offer as an option is 18.,3.0
eidolon 58,Functional,"The program started off really well with great support and guidance to get healthy in a positive way. It helped me which is why it's disheartening to see the changes over the last 8 months. There is no coaching just glorified social media with everyone trying to out do the other. The app has issues for example when they applaud your logging ""streaks"" I've logged every single day for over a year but because of glitches my app says otherwise. Annoying",3.0
Josh S,Functional,"A very good program with (so much) room for improvement in the app. Pros: The program actually works if you commit to it. Bite sized information. Cons: The app is broken, glitches changing my location in the program. The default calorie goal it gave me was CRAZY HIGH. Quick fix: calculate your own, and adjust your age up until you get a reasonable calorie goal. Accountability buddies didn't work. It is clear that some features were removed/scaled back, coaches for example... I have a coach?.",3.0
Sarah Norman,Functional,"Though the psychology behind this program is great and probably the most effective, the app itself is incredibly glitchy. I lose data, have lost progress, and have been put on a course more than once. The other downfall is with tracking food. You can't build recipes and then portion them out. If one of the main pillars is about learning to eat more mindfully, the app's design should reflect that. Customer service has been quick, but explanations haven't always been intuitive.",3.0
Joseph Chouinard,Functional,"Overall it's good, There's just a couple pain points that I hope get addressed. First, the barcode scanner is really bad at focusing on the barcode, it always seems to auto-focus on the background, which makes it hard to scan foods. Secondly, for me, the app never launches properly when clicking on their step tracking widget, it just shows a white screen with the noom logo. And lastly, the food serving sizes are often wrong given the calories or vise versa. Just need to be careful when entering.",3.0
Maria Vaiaso,Functional,"This program is really good, but after the initial set up you are unable to set new events and weight goals. The app is still telling me about a wedding that happened months ago, despite the fact that I met the goal. It won't let me set a new event for my upcoming vacation. It works great in the short term, but doesn't adapt to evolving needs.",3.0
Stephanie Lee,Functional,"It has been helpful with the information included with the program (the lessons), but I really wish there was a way to create a recipe to then use for meals for my week. I cannot log meals I've food prepped because I don't know the exact amount of the ingredients per serving.",3.0
Evy Susilo,Functional,"Been on Noom for about a month now. Its pretty good program. But the app is another story. They promoted Noom Circles. I tried to access that from the app. I can't. The app kept showing the rotating red diamond icon for a long time that I quit it. My phone broke, got a new one, installed Noom fresh - same thing. Approached the support team, its as if they do not read my emails since I have done the standard solutions, but fire their SOPs answer. That's disappointing.",3.0
LeAnn Tucek,Functional,"I tried this app again. I don't like that I can't connect my Fitbit, only Google fit. Also I can't create my own meals. I have to add each individual ingredient. Since I do a lot of cooking at home, this is really inconvenient.",3.0
Scott,Functional,"It's OK if you eat packaged foods with bar codes, and need handholding and community to manage your own behavior. But if you're just tracking food intake, it's inferior to free apps like MyFitnessPal, esp. if you cook for yourself. You can't add your own recipes, so you type in each ingredient every meal, or choose a proxy from their database, which can be way off. I hate the simplistic system that categorizes foods based ONLY on caloric density: green/yellow/red. But it works for some people.",3.0
Renee Booth-Petty,Functional,"It's okay for the most part. But it doesn't track other movements besides exercise and 'custom' is so vague. Choices of food is limited and cannot add proper ingredients or measurements. The step counter does not work regardless of the choice made. Paying for services when the app doesn't work really is subpar. If it doesn't get fixed, I will cancel EVERYTHING and do something else that actually works.",3.0
myrena berry,Functional,A few of the features aren't working and I've only had the app a few days. The food lookup tool is not showing on the main menu and the win with water tool doesn't work right.,3.0
Asher,Functional,"An ok app. For the price of subscription not quite what I expected. But It helped me stay mindful of what I eat on the other hand, their food tracking is helpful and I like their lessons. One negative I will say is that pedometer refuses to work for me. I already contacted noom support about it. They basically told me they were aware of the issue and to keep the app updated. So one less feature for me to use. Which for the price ... I wish it did work.",3.0
Christina Connolly,Functional,I'm really enjoying the programme and finding it educational and helpful but there are so many issues with the app itself - my Google fit is tracking my steps but Noom won't sync with it at all and won't accept my manual step adjustments. I can't add a profile photo. Lots of little niggly bits that effect the overall UX.,3.0
Melody Gatto,Functional,"App is pretty glitchy. The bar code scanner only works sometimes. Most of the time it doesn't recognize the food item. The ""database"" hardly has any foods in it (fit bit has much more) even the bar code scanner only brings up items about 10% of the time. Give it a better food data base, and freeze less.",3.0
v â€œFilthyMcNastyâ€,Functional,For the most part this app is great. My one major complaint is that step logging just doesn't work on my android phone. You can't even manually log your steps as logged by another app.,3.0
Nisha Woods,Functional,It kinda suck that noom no longer offers a free version . I wish they would've said that before taking that long assessment. I used this app years ago and loved it.,3.0
Amanda Ropek,Functional,"I was thinking about signing up for this app and did start the free trial. However, when I got into the app it was constantly trying to get me to join immediately and offering me a lower price every time I declined. Honestly, just felt kind of gross by the end of it. For example, if you cancel your membership, it will offer you a monthly rate which you can't get upfront. If you have a good enough product, you shouldn't have to beg people to stay. Just give people an honest price up front.",3.0
David Bott,Functional,"I've used Noom for years...giving it a other go here now as I try to work out more again and lose some weight. 3 stars because you still can't type in a number, it's a huge pain to scroll from 400 calories all the way to 100 or whatever you're logging. Otherwise great app.",3.0
Jessica Young,Functional,Definitely teaching me how to eat properly. However why does the database have to reload itself everyday?? Surely there must be an option to keep that data available 24/7,3.0
W M,Functional,So much could be improved. Food database never loads and so many basic foods not available. Huge pet peeve with this app. Program is great but why can't I find even recently logged foods that showed up other times??,3.0
Angela Shaw,Functional,"The program itself is wonderful. I've been doing Noom for just over a year and have lost weight and have become more mindful in my approach to food. The app is horrible! It reset my articles back to the very beginning without warninh. Nothing we have tried so far to fix it has worked. Additionally, the sync with Fitbit is hit or miss on the steps and weight. There was only one time it did a sync with my blood pressure monitor and about half of the foods/meals I saved are missing.",3.0
Andrew Thomas,Functional,Tablet and cross-device app support is lacking. The food I enter on my phone doesn't seem to sync with my tablet. Also the app doesn't support tablet screens well at this time.,3.0
Jennifer Waugh,Functional,"Seems like Pre-made food deliveries are not scannable and the information has never been updated after manually putting it in. Nutre, Factor and Cook Unity food delivery services are not able to be scanned. I hope the app gets the information that I manually log to update the system. Other than my food not being found, I like the app!",3.0
Cathy Post,Functional,"It is a great program overall, and I still plan on doing continuing this plan. Only drawback is you cannot create your own recipes that can be categorized by their food categories (orange green yellow) on a android. This would be a very good tool to have and learn from.",3.0
paula elding,Functional,"The app is good, the psychology is interesting, not lost much weight but building better habits. The 3 star because it is US based which I didn't realise and some English food I cannot log easily.",3.0
Peter Taylor,Functional,"A good way of tracking food and weight but it's riddled with errors. I would recommend having the courses proofread. I noticed so many mistakes. Not just grammar and general errors, like multiple punctuation points, but errors in advice. One snack recommendation was 680g of popcorn! Great if you are putting on mass for those Hawaiian shirts.",3.0
mariko blouin,Functional,The app doesn't connect to pedometer app on my side. There is no way to note when you're on vacay or out of town as I don't lug a scale around. Less psych stuff more practical advice.,3.0
Jessi,Functional,"The program is good. I have lost weight and I enjoy the lessons and moving through the courses. The app, however, is terrible. For a couple of weeks it was stuck on my course progress and would not let me advance. That was fixed but now it will not load AT ALL, even after uninstalling and reinstalling. The media feature constantly shows up in the background when I never use it. I extended my free trial but when that's done I will not be paying so much money for an app that doesn't work.",3.0
Kathleen James,Functional,"The psychology programme itself and lesson delivery is ok, but the app has several minor bugs. The interface is non-intuitive, with hidden menu options. Food logging is very easy (if you use US cup measurements), but tedious if you want to log, say 375 ml. You can only enter one meal at a time, which leads to having to go out and start over. It offers connectivity to fitbit and other devices, but that only works intermittently. It's expensive but you can get some personal coaching.",3.0
Kevin Chester,Functional,Meal tracking part of the app is hopeless if you cook from core Ingredients. Barcode scanner is good if you live on packaged food. Cheaper than Second Nature but no where near as good.,3.0
Ori Peer,Functional,My biggest two issues with the app is that it's food database leave much to be desired and that the app struggles with syncing steps with other apps such as Withings.,3.0
Edward McKenna,Functional,"At first, I was impressed by the app, because it taught me a lot about the psychology of weight loss & diet & I enjoyed listening to the speakers. But after about three weeks of using the app, I realized that the audio was AI generated & that ruined the experience for me. I can't justify paying $180 every quarter, because it feels cheap now. Also, I felt deceived by the app. I thought that the speakers were real humans at first, but then they switched to AI without notice. This could be 5 stars",3.0
Shelly Gordon,Functional,"I was on the program for a year to lose weight and that part was great. I have been officially off for about 4 months but continue to weigh in weekly, exercise, and track calories with the app. I'm happy to say I'm maintaining my goal weight. The app itself has a lot of technical glitches that could be improved. For example, the pedometer is connected to my Fitbit, but it hardly ever transfers my steps correctly and sometimes not at all. This has been a consistent problem from the start.",3.0
Gwen Fisher,Functional,"It has been days of not recording my steps at all. I've cleared the cache, reinstalled, reconnected and still nothing works. This affects my allowed calories so it's incredibly frustrating! I've been losing weight but don't want to continue using this app with all the glitches!!",3.0
Twyla K,Functional,"I really like the NOOM concept but the glitches get me. My steps aren't syncing, and neither can I enter them manually. They say they are working on it but it's been like that all week. There was an update yesterday I installed, and it seemed to work for a spilt second, then nothing. This is disheartening when you're on such a critical journey in your life. I know it's beyond my control, but this is really stressing me out. Please fix it!",3.0
Beth Lachance,Functional,"It works well most of the time. The biggest issue is step count with Fitbit - it is inconsistent. Some days it works fine and others, my steps don't appear in the app at all.",3.0
Robi Joseph,Functional,"Really enjoying the program. Been using it for 4 months and have lost almost 40lbs. However, the AI voices really dampen the experience. The use of human voice actors was one of the biggest reasons I subscribed. They sounded friendly, engaging, and made me feel like they were really talking to me. But after lesson 301, awkward-sounding AI voices are used more and more and suck all the life out of listening to the lessons. Can't stand the lessons now. Bring back the real voice actors, please!",3.0
L Teee,Functional,The content in the app nicely laid out. Liked the way the calorie counter changed when I'd exercised...knowing i could have an extra small treat in evening was good for morale to continue programme. Liked the psychology & quizzes.Being more engaged with app &using regularly made me stick to it more. The step counter stopped working no matter how many times i tried 2 reconnect. Worked 2begin with. The app wouldnt save manually inserted steps. Barcode reader not the best & some foods not on system,3.0
KP McQuoid,Functional,"I have been following the program. The app is not working properly, I do EVERYTHING I am supposed to and NEVER earn my daily coins!! I have contacted the Noom administration too. Rewards are part of the program and I NEVER get one. Also, FYI, the program is NOT PERSONALIZED at all. And.. you DON'T get a Noom coach. I am pretty dissatisfied for the 150$+ I paid! Really sucks! I could have used myfitnesspal for FREE. YEAH, I learned a little about why I eat at certain times. NO REFUNDS",3.0

There's no desktop option and I can't log in on my new device. I got a new phone, tried logging out of the app on my old phone, but couldn't find anywhere to do so, so I just deleted the app on there when setting up my new phone. I've now been trying for three days to access my account and I cannot! It tells me it's logging me in, but then gets stuck loading!",3.0
D S,Functional,"I don't want to give it low stars because I did make progress with it, however I have made even moreon my own by reading about food psych and an excel chart with 4 columns. It is hard to justify the cost of the app with this in mind.",3.0
Patrick King,Functional,"What Noom teaches is true, but is it applicable to me? The jury is still out. As a calorie counting app, it's easier than others I've tried, but when you must enter something just as calories, the wheel thingie is maddening. Just let me type a number!",3.0
Leanne Dodd,Functional,"It's OK, not ideal and in the UK the calories are not accurate & you can't amend. I also cannot forward log food for the next day - this is a massive issue for me as I prepare my breakfast and lunch the night before to take to work.",3.0

It's still nothing but a white screen. I've really needed Noom, and it wasn't there for me.",3.0
Amber St.Jacques,Functional,"It really is helpful in losing the weight. The accountability is good. But the app has too many issues. Sometimes items that were there yesterday are no longer listed today. The calories are incorrect on some food items, and there is no way to alter it. The pedometer is always wrong, and I have to adjust the steps everyday. The feedback from the coaches has been ok but not anything worth paying for. There are tons of free apps where you can log your weight and food. This one is just not worth it",3.0
Laura Cleveland,Functional,"I'm having the same exact issues as A Millard's review on 8/21. I have done all the suggestions given to me- hard stopped app, restarted, uninstalled/reinstalled, nothing is working. I was up to lessons 301 when my app stopped working and brought me back to 101. I haven't had a new lesson in close to 2 weeks. This is a big part of why I joined this program. I've now lost momentum It's very discouraging ðŸ˜ž. Next step is asking for a refund and on to something else. (Android user)",3.0
emo,Functional,"So far so good, but during the courses it regularly asks you to review your previous answers/goals/or rewards - but it doesn't show you them and these aren't saved anywhere; plus when they were a few days or weeks ago I can't always remember them or the specific wording! When I asked it was recommended that I should take screenshots and then check these to remind myself, though I think this should really be self contained in the app, in one place - so it better helps to keep you on track.",3.0
Phil Matthews-Jones,Functional,"While some parts of the app work well the food logging is a mess. The data for existing items is frequently incorrect, with no apparent way to flag it. Recipe handling is just about non-existent. Since I have to double check the figures it gives I'm at the point where I'm thinking I may as well just enter total calorie count.",3.0
Penelope FiberGal,Functional,"Good support system/plan layout, but mediocre app. Food tracking isn't as friendly as WW or MFP. Slightly better than Fitbit. There's no cross device sync, so you're stuck with your phone. No web access either. I don't have my phone all day every day, so it's not a great fit for me. Also I can't plan a day's meals the night before. I'm a planner and I like to plot out my breakfasts for several days. No bueno. Luckily I got the plan for free through my health insurance, so I'm not losing anythi",3.0
Beth Rippen,Functional,"It worked well when I needed to lose weight. I did and cancelled when I was at my goal weight a year ago. Then I eventually quit smoking and gained some back. I returned to find they'd discontinued the part that helped me - groups. Now it's Reddit (well, a nicer version) and I feel entirely disconnected from the many coaches and other users.",3.0
Laurie Capricci,Functional,Completed 304 and the reading material comes up as Noom 101. Has been stuck on this page for 2 wks. None of troubleshooting inst. have helped No update button app have version 11.24,3.0
karen hinkforth,Functional,App has a great database. I would have rated it higher but I'm having difficulty getting rid of the unwanted messages from the so-called coach. Customer Service chat is useless. It asked me to send a sceenshot of the messages! Noom sent them!,3.0
Dan Fain,Functional,"The program does seem to work, I think I am losing weight by following their instructions over the last 3 months. However, the experience isn't really what I had been hoping for. Noom would be a good fit for someone who isn't very active and feels like they can't control their snacking or don't know why they eat what and when they do. For someone who already lives a fairly healthy lifestyle and exercises intentionally, it's just a fancy wrapper around calorie counting, and it's pretty expensive.",3.0
Raul Guerrero,Functional,"Noom is a great app, with lots of wonderful insight to change the way you think about food and develop a healthier relationship with it. Not to mention tools like the food logging journal which is easy to use. My issue is the inability to adjust one's caloric goal manually. My metabolism is incredibly slow, and the app tells me my caloric intake for each day is significantly higher than it takes for me to stay the same weight, let alone lose it. It's quite frustrating but otherwise, useful.",4.0
Erin B,Functional,"The app is a big improvement over the previous Noom app. The UPC code scanner does not work well for me, but the other features make logging and tracking easy. I had trouble finding my exercise plan, but customer service responded quickly and resent via email. I wish I could download my meal plan for ease of use. I am discovering new features.",4.0
kayla gray,Functional,"I really like this app. It has been working for me to remind me what I already should know and helps me really see how many calories are in the food I choose. I think it could have a few tweaks to organize our individual meal logging, but overall I think this is great app. They are responsive when you need them and the articles are encouraging and helpful.",4.0
Nicole Larson,Functional,"I'm really happy with this app so far. It's a reasonable approach to weight loss without extremes. It provides useful tools and ""psych tips"" to help you educate yourself and be successful in both losing weight and keeping it off. Using the app I'm both eating less and becoming more active. So far, so good. It's easy to stay on the program and not fret the occasional back-sliding and plateaux. Update: the app is glitchy. Tech support doesn't fix the problems. I don't like the service cutbacks.",4.0
Angel White,Functional,Started noom a little less than a month ago. Overall I like the app and it works well for me. It syncs with my fitbit to track my steps and with my scale for my weight. It has a pretty large database of food although I've found some inconsistencies between their information and the actual data on the food label. I like the variety of ways it offers common sense estimates for measuring food. Makes it easy when out. App can be glitchy at times and has been down for short periods.,4.0
Marina R.,Functional,"There are definitely some bugs that need to be worked out. Some people say their on-demand coach seems like a person, but mine seems like a bot. If it's a person they give some generic, impersonal advice. Also, it seems that when you scan food items the calories are not always correct. Overall, I have enjoyed the experience and sustainability of the program. In just one month I've lost almost 5lbs of my 15lb goal. Edit: using Noom for the second time. The coaching platform is much better now.",4.0
Rachel Hartle,Functional,"Since starting, I have seen results, and I am thrilled! The program is fantastic! I've learned a lot, and have become more mindful of what I'm eating. I will continue to use it to get to my goal weight, and possibly beyond to see if it helps with maintaining my goal weight. However, that being said, the app, has some issues with occasional glitches, and particularly the label scanner has been frustrating. I still would definately recommend NOOM though. It works from what I've seen so far!",4.0
Jd Moore,Functional,"The app needs some attention. I lost 20 lbs on Noom. Got mad at the app/support/excuse,excuse and gained weight back. A year later, I tried again. Saw the app was still a challenge but remembered that I EASILY lost weight, so I committed. In 18 months, I blew past 3 weight goals and lost 100 lbs. The app can be annoying. Responses from support can be annoying. But, I can't argue with the results. I'd rather lose weight than worry about glitches. That's what I signed up for.",4.0
Angela Fulkerson,Functional,I love that Noom uses psychology to help me understand my food choices! I love that I'm loosing weight and still feeling satisfied after I eat. I love that I'm learning to eat healthier. What I don't love is that their app can be super buggy and frustrating. It won't register my steps. Logging food can be super time consuming. When entering my meals it has a data base of recipes but doesn't show the ingredients so I can't use them for my own calorie count unless I make one of their recipes.,4.0
Brad Bechler,Functional,"I've been using Noom for about three weeks and I am really enjoying the program. I'm learning about the psychology side of weight loss and how it affects my decisions with food. Along with this, Noom does a great job classifying foods into their color groups. It's an excellent guide to help make better food choices. They could improve the food logging portion with a better code scanner but overall I'm very satisfied. Lastly, the two week trial is great to test out the app to see if you like it.",4.0
Jeanne Haas,Functional,"Loving Noom! App is easy to use, and support is great at helping in any way they can. Customer service is fantastic. Would give 5 stars if app glitches were fixed. Keep experiencing daily lessons disappearing and when they reappear it starts over at the beginning... can't move forward very efficiently that way! Hope they figure this glitch out soon.",4.0
Jennifer Linder,Functional,"The Noom system is easy to understand and follow. I like that they do not send you food. From the start you are shopping and preparing your own meals. The first reason is that prepackaged food is so high in sodium. The second is that although meal plans show you portion sizes, they are unrealistic with how easy it is to switch from packaged food to fresh. Fresh food is always better tasting and for you. Third is price. Paying the reasonably priced fee(s) for the program, training, and support.",4.0
Adam Chapman,Functional,"The program is great but the app could use a lot of work. Tons of inconsistencies between iPhone and Android versions. I know it has to be difficult to track calories of thousands of foods, but I've come across a few barcodes that pull up other foods and sometimes, the same food has different calories depending on what version of the app you use. I've had the app for 4 weeks now and I'm still learning new things about, but things that would have been useful from the beginning.",4.0
Richell Lindinger,Functional,"So far my experience has been good! I'm down a three pounds since I started a few days ago and am looking to continue and see more positive results. What I enjoy are: 1. Tracking what is eaten along with losing weight, but learning through lessons how to manage weight loss. 2. Interactive game to learn the better calorie dense food (some have surprised me). 3. You are both thrown into everything at one time, instead each day something else is added ie.Tracking steps, calories, exercise & more.",4.0
Lauren Sternhagen,Functional,Update 7.2023 I still use Noom the free version. Step counting much improved and weight graph also improved. The simple act of logging my meals and regular weigh ins have helped me a lot. ### I have been using the app for a little over a year and have made steady progress towards my goals. My recent complaint tho is the weight graph the display. It seems they have removed the units on the Y axis so I can only see initial weight and goal weight explicitly labeled. Not sure why that was done.,4.0
Shea Kelly,Functional,"The program itself is great. It makes healthy eating rather than dropping pounds the goal. It's really helped me not feel anxious when being calorie conscious with the positive attitude. I don't use the other app features(recipes, circles) because they aren't very easy to use.",4.0
Benjamin Kalish,Functional,"I really appreciate Noom. The app has been helpful so far and my fitness journey has so far been on track. The psychological approach to would works, and I appreciate the positive message. My dislikes are the approach to upsell (it feels like they are not selling a complete product with the basic plan) and the confusing message when you cancel add ons ( I cancelled my premium subscription and the cancellation message seemed to indicate my whole subscription was going away.)",4.0
Richard Fuller,Functional,"So far so good. the program is logical and can be scaled up or down to your needs and available time. Slight glitches include: not moving automatically to the current day and daily calorie targets not matching weekly summary targets if you track your physical activity. These are small inconveniences so if I could give partial stars I'd do 4.5, so really pretty good.",4.0
Jordan Kelly,Functional,"I love this app and program. I've been using it a week and have already lost weight, and more importantly, I feel better! There's just one problem: the price. I can't afford to continue after the trial. I can do most of the same things by using a couple of other fitness apps together. The one component that I will miss is the daily health and behavioral therapy articles. They really help keep me educated and motivated.",4.0
S Howard,Functional,"Good in general so far, but one big technical issue- it leaves a huge footprint in my cache of a GB or more after *anytime* I record anything, which makes both the app and my phone super laggy till I stop and take care of it. I've never seen anything like this before and I'm a little apprehensive about it going forward, since it's an issue for keeping all my apps updated. Seems like this app itself needs to be streamlined/ lose the weight somehow.",4.0
Robin Palachuk,Functional,"Loving the program and the results. The app has some issues that can be irritating for me. I like to read long and listen to each lesson/article. There are a few lessons where the text and the spoken word are different, which I find distracting when trying to take in important information. there is no option to rewind a lesson/article or to turn back a page within the lesson/article. If you want to reinforce something in a lesson, you have to go back to the beginning. If you didn't 'bookmark' an article there is no way to review them. It seems to me that having the ability to control and review the content is a key to learning more effectively for some. Program gets a 5 the app gets a 3 for a combined score of 4.",4.0
Cody S Bakken,Functional,"The Noom program is an excellent concept. The pairing with a personal coach is better than I could have expected. The breakdown in process and micro-steps is truly inspiring. Broadly, it is awesome. But the app has problems itself. The UI is far from intuitive. The activity tracker is anything but functional, including that annoying voice and its frequency while engaging in activity. Most importantly, the program is auto-pay and there is no simple, user-capable way to deactivate.",4.0
Brett Stoll,Functional,"The app itself is good, but it is sometimes hard to get the barcode reader to work properly. Having used MyFitnessPal's reader with no issues, I know it's not my camera. The most frustrating thing I have encountered is having to reinstall it on multiple occasions, because it won't load. All that said, I like the app, recipes, and overall ease of experience using. The program is interesting and easy to customize as needed.",4.0
Kelly Echeverri,Functional,"The app is pretty user-friendly and self-explanatory. The information/lessons are quite helpful/insightful. The food logging component is simple, but can be a bit inaccurate at times (I cross check with food packaging). The coaching aspect can be hit or miss. All in all, I would say it's a good program for accountability, motivation, and providing strategies/tools.",4.0
Rachel King,Functional,"Updated: they fixed the annoying popup issue! But still some things I wish they'd fix below. 5 stars for content and lessons, 3.5 for how some of the features work. there is no way to go back a screen in a lesson if you miss something, you have to start all over. The weight graph also does not look very good. My other fitness app has a much better weight tracker where you can change the time period you look at and it is easier to see your progress.",4.0
M Godwin,Functional,"I love the program and I think it is well thought out and put together. It's easy to see successes on and off the scale. The app needs a little work though; namely more fitness tracker connectivity options, more food choices, and it seems to freeze/glitch about once a day. Will it stop me from using the program? Absolutely not, the program is fantastic. The app has room for improvement.",4.0
Rebecca Breitbard,Functional,"Update: after a rocky technical start, things are going really well. Just don't try to run it on more than one platform. But other than those glitches, Noom is amazing!! So inspiring, so informative, so motivating! We've all tried a million different programs, and we've all been very discouraged. With a tiny amount of work daily, this one has made a huge difference in my life!! Old post: The program is great (at least up to 3 weeks), but app is terrible - or maybe just on Android phones?",4.0
Nila Duggan,Functional,"I think noom is great. However, it seems like they don't particularly like to develop their android app (apple has many more features). Also, their calorie tracker has a terrible UI. You shouldn't have to scroll through numbers to select serving sizes. Often all you can pick is 1/2 or a whole cup, which is not realistic. If you want to use calories it starts at the calories for a whole package (let's say 1000), and you have to scroll all the way through to what you want (maybe 100). :(",4.0
Kate Craig,Functional,"It definitely works--I've lost more weight than I ever could have imagined in such a short time. However, the other reviews saying the app is buggy / not all features work on Android are correct. I have to put in a lot of foods by hand, and other features are only available for iPhone. It also keeps forgetting that it's supposed to be synced with Google Fit. Given all this, I'm almost annoyed that it actually works, because it feels so simple, but it works and I'm sticking with it.",4.0
Amanda Klieforth,Functional,"The ""on-demand"" coaching is a lie, but other than that the program seems to be sound. Assuming you do everything they tell you, you should be able to lose weight despite the app issues. Also, the food logging is buggy. Some foods are in the system multiple times, sometimes with the wrong calorie count, sometimes in the wrong color category. And the barcode scanner often brings up the wrong product. But hey, the weight loss cience is good. I'm losing weight. It works.",4.0
Elisha Hall,Functional,"Noom does a good job of working with the psychology and science of weight loss. Concepts are presented in a fun, easy-to-understand format with lessons every day. I would give five stars except the app use is a bit clunky. Each day you weigh and there's a nice graph to show your overall trend. However, I can't zoom out to see the overall trend. I forced to focus on one week. Also, you enter goals and plans in the app. There is no place to retrieve those goals. Wish I would have written it down.",4.0
Elizabeth Brewer Martinez,Functional,"What a great tool! At one month in, I'm 8 lbs down and consistently losing. I'm really impressed with the quality of the content. It's starting to change my perspective in so many ways. The only tweak I have is to be able to add a food and have the app process it as a red, yellow or green food for future use. I've added a few foods (with their nutrition content) and they still don't show up with their color classification even weeks later.",4.0
Caitlin Schultz,Functional,"App is easy to use and functions pretty well overall; only a few clunky functions. One complaint is that once you add a workout, the app doesn't allow you to edit or remove it on Android; that's definitely something I hope is remedied at some point, especially for a paid service. Otherwise it works well, and as a program, I'm enjoying Noom and finding success with it.",4.0
Dyana,Functional,"The app is great, the lessons are super interesting, and the program is easy to follow making lifestyle changes easy and sustainable. I'm not as happy with my coach or the input I'm getting. It's very robotised, and I feel like there's a screen for the coach with a push-button automated response for any question I ask. Pretty impersonal and rarely helpful. The app is great, guess I'll just stick with that.",4.0
Brooke Bilyj,Functional,"The program itself is effective: I instantly started losing weight and I've recommended it to friends and family. However the app itself has a lot of room for improvement. The step tracker never syncs with my system pedometer so I always have to input it manually, the food logging system has a lot of missing and wrong info, and the app takes several minutes to load/open. I'm disappointed by the (lack of) personalized coaching and group support, but the lesson material has taught me a lot.",4.0
Faith Cook,Functional,"I have a love/hate relationship w/ this app. The concepts & most of what it does is great! I want to give it a 5 because it delivers on what the ads promise as far as weight loss. But it will occasionally do something ""glitchy"" that just really, really aggravates me because it's never anything that I can fix, and I've even been told by tech staff that a newer phone would fix the problem, but it didn't. But! if you can deal with that, this app is definitely a winner.",4.0
Lisa Jones,Functional,"I think Noom is a fun and informative way to start a healthy lifestyle/weight loss journey. They make the daily articles fun while going into the 'why' behind their process, food categorization, and the goals they set for you. And the goals are very realistic and achievable in a very 'slow and steady wins the race' kind of way. I docked a star because the calorie portions listed in their database are basically only 10% accurate. Some are off by 5 and some by 100 so it's a lot of manual entry.",4.0
Melinda Angstadt,Functional,The program is awesome! Finally someone understands the real issue behind the weight struggle. The app is horrible! So much wasted time going back and forth when planning my whole day's meals. It's all so unnecessarily time consuming.. Calories are off a lot. Would love to see the calories for individual items on meal planning screen as well as total calories left. Would love to be able to analyze and go right back to meal screen. A tutorial would be helpful. Would love to enjoy the app!,4.0
Lindsay (Lindsay),Functional,"I like the content of the app and think it is a good program. However, it doesn't seem like the content is proofread; I find at least one typo a day. Also the food tracker is not great. When scanning barcodes, many times the info doesn't match the label or foods from chain restaurants don't match the restaurant nutrition info. I like the program and content, and the focus on changing your thinking is very good. I reccomend the program, but the app itself needs work.",4.0
Chris Doyle,Functional,"I've been using for several weeks and have lost 8 lbs. I enjoy the lessons, tips & tricks, & the group chat. Helps keep me on point. Had trouble getting the pedometer to work, had to restart my phone. But since the update it's been glitchy. Have to have it in my pants pocket or doesn't register my steps, sometimes slow to catch up. The database calories aren't always correct; added foods 3 weeks ago but hasn't updated. Haven't tried the exercise feature yet. Just getting started.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The structure of the program is absolutely brilliant. I love it, it really works. Like having a support system right in the palm of your hand. I've lost almost 7 pounds in 4 weeks. Most importantly I feel like what I'm learning and doing is sustainable. Only problem is the app is still kind of glitchy, lots of errors in the food logging and recipe sections, trouble with the pedometer in several ways. But despite all the glitches I'd keep doing it because the program really works!!!",4.0
Jennifer S,Functional,"The weight loss program and coaches are great. The app was easy to use for quite a while, but when I started a new phase of the program, it was sometimes very frustrating to deal with. Content sometimes moved around or was hard to open or record completion of specific sections, etc. Sticking with it, but glad it was better at the beginning.",4.0
Erin Ludwick,Functional,"I love this program! It's the first thing that I've found that actually makes sense and seems sustainable. I wish that the app had a few easier features, like an easier way to search for food calories and categories if you're in the grocery store without having to log it as though you are eating that meal. The food search isn't quite as navigable as the MyFitnessPal app to me either. I would also like for the app to have your personal goals highlighted when you open the app each time.",4.0
Jim Rutkowski,Functional,"The daily lessons help me keep focused on my goal. The personal coaching is helpful as well. Overall, it is definitely working for me. The food/calorie database in the food tracker is very inaccurate most of the time though, so you have to watch that. It is frustrating when you have a serving of something that is listed on the package as say 150 calories but the data base has it listed as 110. You always have the ability to adjust/correct the calories but it can be a little time consuming.",4.0
Maggie DorÃ©,Functional,"This is different than any other health & weight loss app/program I've tried. I like it a lot. The app is fairly well organized. The food database is a bit off; I've found several errors, which can be reported but doesn't help in the moment. I wish there was a recipe calculator like some other apps have so I can input my own variation and get an accurate color and number of calories. I like the interaction with real people along with the reading and resources.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"App is great, support is great, plan is great! There are a few things that need improved, though. IPhone users have the ability to input a recipe and the app calculate everything for them. However, it does not allow Android users to input recipes. This is a pain, period. Another thing that I think would be helpful would be to implement a shortcut to the label scanner tool. It would be really handy for scanning quickly at the store instead of navigating to where you log food and checking it there.",4.0
Dameon Varlack,Functional,"The content is good, as I've lost close to 20 pounds altogether. My problems are mainly with the app itself. When I adjust the weight loss speed, it doesn't change the calorie budget. Then when I try to make my daily step goal fixed, it still adjusts automatically. Also the pedometer option doesn't work. Final word of caution: you can not count on their nutritional data to be accurate. ALWAYS look at the lable and do the math. If you follow the program and record accurately you will lose weight!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Noom is the best weight loss and management program I've used, because it focuses on changing behaviors. I'm at the lowest weight I've seen in a very long time. Highly recommend! 4 stars because the app itself could be more user friendly. I hate the live workout tracker. Also i don't have the ability to bundle ingredients into one food item to save for later.",4.0
Sapna Anderson,Functional,"User friendly app with nice interface. Good graphics and very interactive. No problems yet. The only thing I would criticize is in the meal-logging section. I might put the 'other units' button in the top right and 'done' on the bottom right. That is usually where the enter button is and I've mistakenly tapped it a few times. Also after finishing the day, we should be able to go back and add something we forgot.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I think the noom program is great. It is providing a different way to approach eating and it has been resonating with me. I feel so much better about my food choices and how I eat. One side effect; lost 7 pounds so far in the first 2 weeks. The app could use some work. I am an Android user and I find the sync to Google Fit is spotty. It sometimes updates quickly and other times not at all. I would also like a widget to log food and view analysis, the navigation back and forth is annoying.",4.0
Beth Zimmerman,Functional,"I'm enjoying the tips & tools. My only disappointment is the Noom Group. It seems that people only use it to post exercise. That gets boring fast. There's very little sharing in a meaningful level. The group leader posts some interesting things. I'm diabetic so the color coding is a little off (cottage cheese is a better choice than oatmeal for me example), but I'm savvy enough to catch that. Otherwise the way the nutrition plan is set up is excellent! I'm learning a lot about food choices.",4.0
Karen Ruppel,Functional,"I have Noomed for almost one year and nearly reached my goal. The program is wonderful and walks you through the science of weight loss. It is well-supported with scientific evidence and really gets at the psychological aspects of human behavior. And, it is humorous! The coaches and group are supportive. The only drawback is the app and a lack of orientation at the beginning. The app needs a back button on each page that allows a participant to re-read pages. Otherwise, Noom is a great tool!",4.0
Donna Dye,Functional,"Noom works, if you do the work of recording all you eat - eye opener! My weight loss was very slow, but it did work. After about 20 lbs I got stuck & nothing worked. But I stayed with it & now I am seeing some more progress. Some of the later reading articles are pointless & I stopped reading. The earlier ones are very helpful. A word of warning - if you don't cancel at the 6 month point, they will automatically charge you for another 6 months, with no notice or email of any kind.",4.0
Barbra Barnes,Functional,"The Noom program is a subscription program that helps you lose weight with psychology. The program itself is aboslutely worth the money!!! The app leaves a lot to be desired. It's imconvenient to navigate. There could be a lot of shortcuts added to save time and allow more ease of getting around within the app. But, as far as the program goes I love it and am happy with my purchase.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Overall I love it. I find the articles and psych tricksvery helpful and I am losing weight in a way I feel is sustainable. The biggest weakness is the food database. You can't just pull up a list of green and yellow foods for meal planning, for example. You can only log food and there are a lot of foods that aren't in the database, and no information at all about macros. Noom needs to either improve this or support syncing with an app with better food information.",4.0
Beth DeMaio,Functional,"Lots of issues initially but actually going very well now. Losing slowly, but seeing numbers I haven't seen in years. The group support is nice, as is the coaching. I like the food calorie color system as opposed to ww points. This was a 2 month ""trial"" for me but I will continue. I like the short, intelligent and motivational lessons every day, which is what sets this apart from other plans. It works very well with my ever changing schedule",4.0
Amy Osborn,Functional,"Content is overall very good. Somewhere around week four, the audio versions are no longer narrated by professional readers, but sound like low budget audios by maybe the coaches?? Then the audio versions disappear altogether. That's a bummer because I like to listen as I'm doing other things. One other minor complaint is that the apps that will sync with Noom for the purpose of step tracking are too limited. I'd rather turn off that feature and save my battery, but that's not an option.",4.0
Trina Wafle,Functional,"Content is great. I'm learning a lot and the psychology angle has been a big help. The app itself appears to have a few glitches. Biggest one for me is the pedometer. It severely undercounted steps but there is a way to edit the count. It also doesn't appear to stop adding more steps each day to your overall goal setpoint once the goal setpointt is met. Minor issues compared to the overall effectiveness of the program, though. I'm losing weight and regaining strength, my reasons for joining .",4.0
Andrew Eldred,Functional,"After using it for 6 weeks I'd say it's a good app. I wish it was more personalized and focused more on what's hardest for me. Android version has fewer features than iOS but I recently figured out how to enter my own recipes which was a relief. The images and examples are skewed towards women. It's difficult to picture myself in some scenarios and most of the images in lessons are of women. Overall, it's a decent app and the program itself has helped me!",4.0
Jenni Bailey,Functional,"I like the lessons, psychological aspects of it and the coaching. I've learned a lot of tips and tricks to help me on my journey. But the app needs some work. It doesn't sync with my Samsung watch for steps. You can't add recipes and log a serving. The scanning function doesn't work half the time and even when it does, you have to watch and change the units or it will be wrong. You can't page back when reading an article, you have to start over. Printed lists don't match color in the app",4.0
Neal Shaffer,Functional,"Overall, this program worked for me and I think it is worth the price, if you're willing to commit. The app has some challenges, it is sometimes buggy & does not play well with poor service/wifi. The program is pretty good. You get out of it what you put into it. The lessons are goofy, but endearing and well informed. The food logging is mostly good, but if you're crafty you can almost always find a way to game noom's color system, finding a way to make a red food yellow, for example.",4.0
Alecia Stafford,Functional,"The app helps with the mental aspect of a lifestyle change. The tracking of food and water intake is great, and the daily weigh-ins help overcome scale fear. But the daily step count is driving me crazy. I'll reach the goal, even go above it, and it will be shown as the goal reached. The next day, when I open the app, my daily step count to hit will be less. When I click back to the previous day, it will show I didn't walk at all.",4.0
Tracy Ramirez,Functional,"I've been using the app now for about a month with my android phone. Alot of the calorie counts are off when compared to the package labels, but if you hit the other unit's at the bottom right it goes to another page to choose servings and most of the time it's closer, or you can change it to calories and just log the amount. I also sometimes get stuck in a loop where it won't let me out of meal logging and I have to close the app and start over... that's very frustrating...but it works enough..",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The Noom weight loss program is 5 stars, all the way! But the app itself is only 3 stars. It is slow, buggy, and not intuitive. If you have the app on both your computer and your phone, even if you're signed in to both, they do not communicate. Each item you eat must be entered separately, rather than as a group. Foods which are mostly vegetables will register as red if they contain even a little oil, rather than as 100 cal of green and 30 cal of red. All of these minuses could be corrected.",4.0
Connor Chacon,Functional,"I've definitely lost weight with this app, and it looks like I might be able to keep it off for good this time, but there's some simple features I'd kinda expect it to have, like a meal planner. Also, its location tracking for exercise is a bit sub par, though it can connect to other apps to fix that issue. Overall, extremely good app, but it could use a little polish.",4.0
Leila Bridgeman,Functional,"Noom is great! It's helped me learn about healthy eating and build healthy habits. The main reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the android app still doesn't have the ability to save recipes, while the apple version has had that for years. Also, it could use some nice visualizations of your calories, steps, excercise, and distribution of calories over red/green/yellow. I'd love to see those plotted like the weight.",4.0
Teodora Chitiboi,Functional,"I really like the concept and psihologie, I think it could really make a difference. The app had some bugs in the activity tracking and I've seen some other small issues, but it's continuously improving. What I found a bit disappointing is that the help/troubleshooting was not up to date with the current version of the app and quite useless for these particular problems. In the end technical support worked with me to solve the problem. I appreciate that a lot so I updated my review.",4.0
Tom Cargill,Functional,"Overall great. Only negative is the food database. It's kind of all over the place, and while most of it is accurate, since people are able to create their own foods to log, some of the options are wildly innacurate. Some items are different colors depending on which you choose, and some of the nutrition information is off. My second time through with Noom and it does work. But they need to sort their food database out. Has improved greatly since my first try, but there is still some room.",4.0
Fitt Boi,Functional,"Great app. Being able to scan meals based on barcodes makes adding food easy. Some things to Improve: - I want to be able to ""zoom out"" of my weight loss charts. I think it would be beneficial to see peaks, restarts, accomplishments in one screen. - the daily dashboard has a poor UX. The calorie counter above looks the same as analysis, yet you have to do 3 clicks to get to it. - It recommends steps, but not other exercise. I'm weightlifting now, and would like to see my form of exercise.",4.0
Lucille DeFrank,Functional,I love the concept of Noon. The quizzes are great to help get inside your head to resolve eating problems. There are some things I'd like to see in the app-- like total nutritional values for the day. Or when you weigh yourself I'd like to see a tally of how much I've lost or gained rather than their graph. The scanner sometimes comes up with incorrect values. While the concept of Noom is great the app needs some work,4.0
Kim Segal,Functional,"The Noom program in and of itself has been amazing. Really enjoying it and seeing progress. The app is pretty good with the exception of the step counter. I have issues getting it to connect with my pedometer app (I don't devices like Fitbit, etc.). There are also some challenges with the group chat, it's a little difficult trying to search through and find certain messages from other users. Love the daily lessons and the access to recipes and being able to track other activity.",4.0
Meg Rae,Functional,I'm really enjoying this program. The full version after the trial is a little spendy but I am getting a lot out of the lessons and group chats. I put 4 stars cause the calorie calculator still need a LOT of work. There is often times where it just doesnt give the right amount between menus (ex: 1 cup = 100 calories on the easy measurements menu and 1 cup = 150 calories on the other for the same item). I've used calorie counters that are free that are much more accurate.,4.0
Meesh M,Functional,"The program itself is great! It's definitely helping me to look at food differently and change my patterns with food and other health factors Most of the app is ok, but it could be more intuitive. Entering meals isn't super easy - it'd be great to be able to build a recipe, and to be able to enter more than one meal at a time. Right now when you enter breakfast and hit ""done"" then you have to go back to homepage to start process over to everett lunch, etc.",4.0
Sydney Berg,Functional,"The app design is great and it's very easy to use. It has helped me to understand how much I'm eating and the food tracking is super easy to use, as well as water, weight, and exercise. I am however frustrated at the way foods are labeled, specifically certain ""orange"" foods. The program tends to focus a LOT on calories, and ignores fiber, healthy fats, and protein content. Water is not the only thing that helps us feel full, and I think Noom misses the mark in this specific area.",4.0
Jimmy Sparkman,Functional,"The app performs it's function very well, allowing you to log meals and weight, as well as tracking activity. The major downside I can find to this app is when scanning barcodes to log meals, the barcode scanner isn't very functional. There's no ability to focus the lens within the app when scanning a barcode. Other than, I find it very user friendly.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I like having the food ""color coded"" to get me in the mindset of good, bad, & ugly. Having feedback from a coach & a group is nice. I do believe it's kept me on track & accountable. If you follow guidelines & suggestions you will lose weight. And it gives you the tools to keep it off. That's what's nice, no special diets, no counting, etc. It doesn't track steps correctly yet. You can override it manually. Sometimes getting the food to log how you want it takes a little math.",4.0
Kate McAuley,Functional,"Very nice and helpful for food tracking, workout tracking, and keeping you motivated. Some features are a little hard to figure out, but there's also a Noom Team set up to message whenever you have a question and they are very responsive. Step counts don't sync to Samsung watch but those are easily updated manually, definitely not a deal breaker. The food logging choices are not as vast as some other programs but that's to be expected and it will only get better as people use it. Love it!",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"The psychology works!! I really like this app and how it works to modify your behavior and little by little, teaches you how to eat right. I didn't realize how badly I was eating and overeating until Noom. It would be nice if you could look up food choices easier to explore options rather than pretending to log to and then delete it. Otherwise I really love it!!",4.0
Amber Witherow,Functional,"So far so good! The program itself is great but there are a few things I'd change about the app itself-- I'd like to turn off the pop up notifications when noom says ""time for a break or keep noomin"" whenever I finish my articles for the day, it's kind of obnoxious. I'd like more foods added to the database. I'd like to suggest a color category for a food that I'm adding. Exercises should flow from Fitbit too not just steps. More options for exercises too.",4.0
Joe Brandibas,Functional,"I am new to Noom, and as far as the app goes, I do like it. However, if you have multiple devices (I have a tablet and two phones) it doesn't share your progress across devices very well. You can go in to the settings and force an update, but it only syncs your time in the app, and food/water logging. It does not keep your progress in the educational courses. On my phone I did the educational stuff, as well as logged my meals and water, but when I open the tablet, I have to do the courses again.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I think the idea behind this app (working on sustainable healthy habits and using psychology to help you) is brilliant and what I've been looking for. That much gets 5 stars. There is potential for more usability though. Logging meals is tedious. That's not noom's fault, it just is. It would be way easier if I could do it on the computer instead of just my cell phone which is a problem noom could fix. Also I wish it were easier to add my own recipes. Cooking at home is encouraged but it is such a pain to have to enter in all the ingredients that you ate guessing at the right quantities. And another idea that would be great is if you accidentally put something in the wrong meal you could move it instead of deleting it and re-entering it in the right meal. (I have more ideas to make the app easier to use and would be happy to consult further, especially if I got compensated.)",4.0
Hayley Tomlinson,Functional,"The program itself is great and has helped me lose weight so far. The app functions fairly well, however the step tracker is always WAY off. I had to download a different app to count my steps properly. By the end of the day it's usually off by at least 1,000 steps. The GPS based exercise tracker also only works if my screen is open to it the entire time, otherwise it doesn't record correctly.",4.0
Joseph Thompson-Wilda,Functional,"The program and features were not right for me, but I will say that Noom's customer service was excellent and responsive. I would recommend giving them a shot with the free trial to see if you like it! My only suggestion regarding the app is to directly support step input via Samsung Health. It sounds like this is something that they're working on, but it was inconvenient trying to sync steps as a Galaxy Watch user.",4.0
Ken K,Functional,"So far, so good. The app uses statistical algorhythms to predict your outcomes based on a questionnaire submitted in the beginning. The app also gives you several small, understandable lectures on the psychology of eating. The goal is to change how you think about eating, and help you change lifestyle patterns. The program is expensive - $10 for the trial, and $185 for one year (as I understand it). I've lost 4 lbs in 4 wks. The app is a little buggy.",4.0
Meg Gonzales,Functional,"The articles have great information that help to change the mind set. They are written so they are easy to read and absorb. The only thing I struggle to look past is the audience it seems to be geared to. While trying to appeal to all ages, it is overly hashtag oriented. I get it, but as one in an older population, I feel it is sometimes a distraction.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"Much like other popular food logging apps, you can scan barcodes or enter individual items to monitor your calorie intake. However, it does not sync with Galaxy watches, so you always have to adjust your steps if you don't keep your phone on your person at all times. I communicate with my goal specialist, my group coach, and other members who are in roughly the same place within the program as I. I'm finding it to be a highly effective tool for making sustainable lifestyle changes with food.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I would love the food portion to be a bit more custom. If I make stuffed bell peppers, for example, I wish I could customize it to ground turkey instead of beef to lower the calorie count. Scanning a barcode is also quite hit or miss, mostly miss. Sometimes the articles get a bit overwhelming in information and hard to remember later. However, 5 weeks in and I have lost 12 pounds, so something is working!",4.0
El Jones,Functional,"The program is highly beneficial. I've lost about 2 pounds per week for the 3 weeks I've been on it, and haven't felt like I've been sacrificing at all. The app, however, is cumbersome. The lessons and stuff are great but the food tracking interface needs to be way more flexible. The content and usefulness? 5 stars. The interface? 3 stars at best. It needs some serious work.",4.0
Chaffron Corder,Functional,"I'm in my 8th week, and so far seeing better than predicted results with a sustainable plan. The app itself is great; I just wish certain areas had greater functionality, like being able to build recipes in the food log. The barcode scanner also seems to have trouble focusing a lot of the time. Overall, Noom is one of the best choices made.",4.0
ED Deadmeato (Ensign Deadmeat),Functional,"Noom is a fantastic weight loss/control service. The purpose of the plan is to teach you the psychology of eating and how to be able to maintain healthy eating after you've left the program. I lost 35 pounds in 3 months. However, the app is missing a few things such as the ability to save your own recipes and a virulent food search like Myfitness has. However overall it has been a fantastic experience.",4.0
Melody Bethards,Functional,"Love the lessons. I have learned a lot about myself and why I eat the way I do. The meal tracker and step tracker don't work well for me. I don't keep my phone with me all the time, and app does not connect to my brand of smart watch. There several options for the same foods on the meal tracker and each option lists different calories for the same foods. It would be nice if the meal analysis would add up the number of calories for yellow and orange foods like it does for green ones.",4.0
Jennifer Case,Functional,"This app is really helping me loose weight. In 2 months I've dropped almost 10lbs. Changing the way you think of food, changing habits etc... Really does work. However, I have discovered several discrepancies. Mistakes in their color coding system that makes me doubt the overall accuracy. The coaching is bare minimum. Not worth the total price....but if you opt to cancel before the trial period, they will offer it to you at a huge discount.",4.0
Shari Lundberg,Functional,"I'm onflicted about scoring this. The weight loss program is great. I find the articles and the opportunity to share experiences with others really helpful and effective. On the other hand the app is a mess. I often have to force stop the app to get the home page to load. Today my step goal suddenly went from 6300 to 0 with no explanation. They have no effective method of communicating tech issues. I'm putting up with the app failures, and just focusing on the content.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've really enjoyed my experience with Noom! It's the first time I feel I might actually stick with the healthy changes (I've tried about every diet out there). This isn't a diet. I love that they use psychology backed up by scientific research and I'm learning a lot. I'm down 13 pounds in 4 weeks (I have a lot to lose and was eating pretty terribly before!), but more importantly I feel empowered to actually change habits for good. Took off a star because the food database needs some polishing.",4.0
Kristen Williamson,Functional,"I really like this app and program. It is motivational and helpful to me as I strive to reach my goals. I can keep track of all areas from diet, exercise, water intake, weight, daily mood, etc. Learning the psychology behind food relationship is beneficial too and different from other weight loss apps that I've tried. The only negative I have found is that sometimes my barcode scanner won't scan even when I can see the full barcode clearly in the scanner window. Overall, I recommend this app!",4.0
Ashley Schlee,Functional,"While I love this app, and always have, I've found that I can't create meals and track that way. I don't have time to sit and track each individual item in a meal and then guess how much I ate. While there are lots of food options, I just find it silly for a program that is so set on making meals at home to not have a create food option (for Android users). All this to say, it's a great app, that has great options and wonderful support. Just need a few more options!",4.0
Leanne Jaeger,Functional,"The program is helpful. Some improvements are needed for the sight. For instance, the recipe section would be better if it had search capabilities such as fish recipes, chicken, pasta and so on. As it is now you just have to scroll through. The only classifications are Breakfast, Lunch etc. I have also found some discrepancies between food label calories and those in Booms system.",4.0
Abigail Santor,Functional,"Mostly great, I paid for the Noom program so I'm not sure what (if) any free features look like. My one major complaint is adding a home cooked recipe is pretty difficult and there's no ""good"" method for it. There are work around, but they're pretty complicated and can be time consuming. Another great thing would be a shopping feature where you can pull up the scanner when you're in the grocery store, right now you have to get in as if you're logging a meal, not too big a hassle, but still.",4.0
-,Functional,"The content and writing style are great, but the group facilitation and the app itself definitely have room for improvement. Articles can be saved but not searched by keyword or time period, and the responses you provide in some of the more interactive articles are not saved, including the major goals you set at the beginning of the program. I learned (a little late unfortunately) to take screenshots of anything like that if I wanted to be able to review it later. There's more but character limi",4.0
Lizzie Jones,Functional,"Noom is a great program so far. I am getting results as far as weight loss and taking better care of myself. It helps put what you consume into perspective. The one disappointment I've found with the app is that the Android version doesn't seem to get the same attention as Apple. There's no zoom for the graph and the pedometer doesn't work, nor can you enter your own numbers. Thankfully I have a Fitbit to keep track.",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I would actually give it 5 stars, if the pedometer wasn't so sensitive. It adds steps when I am in the car, so I have to try and remember to pause it. Otherwise a very good app. Has helped me eat better, move more and therefore lose weight",4.0

A Google user,Functional,"I use only the free version of Noom, mostly to log my meals. Overall I really like the app! However, there is one thing I find really annoying: I use the ""precise input"" of usually either ""g"", ""mL"" or ""calories"" very often. For instance: With a lot foods and beverages I rather rely on the actual calories on the nutrition label than on the calories in the Noom database and then calculate the precise calories by myself. Also when cooking or preparing food I usually use a kitchen scale and measure the ingredients I use. The input with this ""spinning wheel"" is quite often pretty annoying, like when you have to scroll this ""wheel"" from 10 to 250 or all the way back. I would love to have the option to enable a numerical input (keyboard) alternatively. Couldn't it just be an option in the preferences to enable something like that. I get it that you want to keep it ""simple"" for most users, however, I don't see what could be simpler than input a value directly rather than spinning a virtual wheel. 4 stars - would be 5 otherwise",4.0
A Google user,Functional,"I can see how the users have lost over 9m kg. There are a few problems though. For some foods, the easy units and the precise units give different calorie counts (1cup for both). Other than that, it's great. Edit: Can I opt not to have the pedometer start automatically? It's quite annoying and drains the battery",4.0
Debbie Kirby,Functional,"The concept is amazing. The app is often not wrkg which makes the program inconsistent and stressful. Perhaps in their lessons they should have a lesson about managing stress when the app is down, prob very applicable to everyone lol. I'm getting to the point where I'm going to cancel if they can't fix the app. That's sad because the program works and the app helps with accountability, tracking and keeping a person focused on the overall goals. It's becoming more frustrating than helpful now",5.0
Abigail Rockett,Functional,"I am a nurse practitioner. I hate it, but it works. Noom puts the foods you choose to eat into three categories. It does make me mindful of my food choices. I also hate the psychological lessons, but they work too. I can't log certain activities like beach walking, but in the long run it really doesn't matter. It is a great program that is refreshingly not incentivised by pre made foods and supplements.",5.0
Carissa Jackson,Functional,"I have only been using the program for 5 days, but I do love how interactive it is. I truly appreciate the listen button! The app does have me excited about the journey, not just reaching my goal weight. I do wish Samsung Health could be a choice for syncing activity. More recently I've had a hard time with adding my meals as the app keeps saying ""more items will be available after the database finish downloading"". I had to restart my phone to fix it. Otherwise everything else is great.",5.0
Laurie Preston,Functional,"I am really impressed with the Noom app and weight loss plan. Everything is all in one place: encouragement, support, tips and research-based ""tricks"" to help you develop more healthful eating habits.

I feel better, and I see steady progress toward my goal.",5.0
Deborah Long,Functional,"I like how the foods are broken out into Green, Yellow and Orange. Nothing is bad or off limits. Seeing the analysis of how you're eating really helps you make better choices. The articles are quick and easy to read; they inject little bits of humor and aren't full of scientific jargon and acronyms that make your eyes glaze over. Coaches reply to your messages. Large database of foods for tracking. Bar code scanner needs some improving. Sometimes brings up wrong food or can't scan at all.",5.0
Leslie Lane,Functional,"I love learning the ins & outs of choosing healthier meals. And the psychology to back it up & give me support & suggestions when I am tempted to eat something that may be delicious but is not healthy. The coaches are very supportive.

It's all here in the app, and if it wasn't for my low metabolism, the pounds would be flying off.",5.0
Suzanne Hendrickson,Functional,"I have been on the Noom program for 6 days. I have eaten very well and enjoying 3 meals and 3 snacks per day. I can eat whatever I want but your success will be based on what you eat. Noom controls your daily calorie intake which can increase by adding simple exercise programs ie walking and gardening. The cost is very reasonable compared to other weight loss programs. The communication between me and the guides has been very consistent. 3 lbs down, 19 to go!!ðŸ",5.0
Nancy L W,Functional,"The program itself is excellent. 20+ lbs lost. The one-on-one consults are well worth the price. The daily articles are cute at first; it makes you want to read them, but rereading it when it's not new is hard to stick with. The app needs tweaks, as does the food logging catalogue. Bookmarking articles you want to reread is easy, but with many bookmarks, articles are hard to find. The food catalogue needs reviewing because some of the same foods can be green or orange depending on which you pick",5.0
Carrie Barrios,Functional,"I am almost one month in. So far I've lost 10 lbs. For me, Noom works because I am accountable for my food choices in a way that is easy.

Though I haven't reached out to a coach yet, it's nice to know they are there if I need them. I love it!",5.0
Darcy DeAngelo,Functional,"This rating is two fold: weight loss program and user experience/interface. The program itself is pretty solid for someone who is motivated or needs help solidifying their motivation. At its core it is slowly provides you with the tools you need so as to not overwhelm you. Definitely worth the cost. The app is almost perfect. Some glitches here and there, and some aspects where I might want to see or have access to something. But overall provides an amazing and easy to use experience.",5.0
Jack Forbes,Functional,"I tried Noom when it first came out but wasn't super motivated to do the program. It's since improved on the psychology to help answer ""why"". The app is a bit clunky (can't edit weight entries, can't view trends at your leisure, hard to navigate food logging) but the content is on point. I got all the bells and whistles this time so the exercise and meal planner have been helpful tools, as well as the new toolbox feature that offers 9 separate tactics to help keep you focused.",5.0
Benjamin Masse,Functional,"I was very skeptical about using a weight loss app and did my research on many. I landed on Noom and was really unsure about paying for the app. The 16 day free trial made me feel more comfortable. And results started coming right away. Easy to follow courses and guides, along with a simple calorie input system along with their green, yellow, and orange system helped me to better understand what, when, why, and how I was eating. One month in and I'm down 17 pounds.",5.0
T S,Functional,"I've never followed a weight-loss program but have put on a few pounds that I haven't been able to shake, until now. Love the program itself. It's fun, smartly written and is working for me. The app is easy to follow and when I've had questions, support has been responsive. I have the app on my android phone and tablet and am glad to see that the UI is the same on both. The step count on my fitbit is registering on the Noom app, just not reflected on the home page. Minor but fixable, I'm sure.",5.0
Linda Cordes,Functional,"I have tried many diets in my life but always got to a place of boredom or plateau. Noon takes on a different approach of psychology and behavioral change. You can eat anything you want but this plan talks about healthy choices and portion control without guilt for occasional slip-ups. It takes time and patience but the weight loss continues its downward trend toward my goal. The object, I feel, is to be accountable for everything that goes into my mouth. I give the program an A+.",5.0
Becky Kilpatrick,Functional,"It's a great way to set the mood for the day. Going through the lessons with morning coffee helps to remember your short term daily goals. Logging food is easy. Setting reminders help me. I travel, eat out, socialize and party, so limiting to no-carbs or certain foods is too restrictive for me. Noom helps me eat better, green food and limit the bad stuff. Also, not trying to be perfect everyday. Can't do it. I still struggle with my wine calories ðŸ˜©. But not giving it up. Just add to daily diet",5.0
Nicole Copeland,Functional,"I like that the app is light (not overwhelming colors + the tone is a little comedic but informative). It is interactive, meaning there are questions to answer or quizzes to take. It provides a lot of knowledge about how our brains work when it comes to eating. I like that it can be joined with other apps like Fitbit or Google Fit (and more) to track your sleep/ steps/ exercise. There isn't a direct log out button, and the account tab doesn't give you the option to update your email.",5.0
Barbara ONeil,Functional,"I find this weight loss program to be like none other. It is non- restrictive while guiding you to changing your behavior. It deals with realistic (calories) units of measure, not some algorithms that have numbers attached to them. Which makes it clear and much easier to understand what you are doing. I highly recommend this program. Trust me you will learn things about yourself and what and how to accomplish your goals.",5.0
Teresa Trevino,Functional,Noom has been a great help to me in creating habits of making better food choices. I know a lot about healthy eating but was never good at accountability and this app is slowly changing that. I am a more mindful eater and the weight is slowly coming off even when I have treats! It is easy to use and has some good recipes available when I am not feeling so creative in the kitchen.,5.0
Nichole Squire,Functional,"The app is simple to use and breaks your daily calories down into three categories: green (eat plenty) yellow (eat moderately) and orange (eat in small doses). I like that it doesn't tell you to stop eating the things that you love. Instead, a focus on better decisions, moderation, and self care is highlighted. The only thing I don't like is that you get automated messages from ""Noom Coaches"" instead of an actual coach or person who checks in on you. That part can feel super impersonal!",5.0
Jill Sizemore,Functional,"The program is extremely helpful. The app is very good, may run into a few frustrations when logging food but still minimal compared to the games of the program. And not weight gains!! ðŸ˜Š The daily lessons are extremely informative. I love that it was recommended to me from an intelligent friend whose advice I could trust. Take the plunge and enroll in a program that will help you understand just why we do what we do when it comes to food. It is changing my life for the better.",5.0
Suzanne J,Functional,"Excellent flexibility and calories tracking as well as training you to change your lifestyle for long-term success - not just immediate weight loss (although that happens, too)! Ability to add a real-life coach to customize things to help you succeed and be accountable (it helps if someone is watching). You can set reminders to exercise/move in any way you like, and you get more calories in a day when you do! Great app!",5.0
Toni TylerAllen,Functional,"The Noom App is a wonderful, easy to use, app that allows the user to keep track of all weight loss progress and goals in one neat package. The program is insightful, intuitive, and has been an extremely pleasant experience. This is the first weight loss program I have used where I actually learn about food, the way the body reacts to it, and how to be healthy. It's not a fad or a short term change. It's a lifestyle, habit forming,learning experience.",5.0
Peg Wiltz,Functional,"The psychology is sound, the lessons are useful and fun to read, and I've been steadily losing weight and examining my relationship with food. Noom team members are responsive and helpful. I have found a few minor bugs in the app which I've been able to report and which they are working on. All in all quite a positive experience so far.",5.0
Yovanka Castellanos,Functional,"I am changing my first review from Oct 2021, now in July 2023, from 2 to 5 stars. I received the help needed back then, yet the app had a few flaws at that moment. I am a come back client, and this time around, the app and program is totally improved and extremely easy to use. I loved the audio parts integrated and also the step counting from fitbit works this time smoothly. Now, there is a team of coaches for you to support, and the food list is longer in the database. I really like it! Good ðŸ‘",5.0
Brian Whiteside,Functional,"Great app and program! I came here specifically to review this app and I've never took the time to review an app before if that says anything! I've been doing the trial. I have done many types of nutritional programs and this one is great at rewarding you and helping with using acceptance vs. going to the extreme (good or bad food). I really enjoyed all aspects. The education, food logging tool, and other tracking tools are on point!",5.0
Nighel Cobb,Functional,"I loved nooms simple guide to weight loss, the calorie tracker worked well and helped me see my progress. I eventually unsubscribed due to the really cheesy text and dialogue in the lessons as I felt it didn't jive with me, but if you can get past that it's great. Would resubscribe if they had a boring old man mode that cut the jokes and just gave me straight facts.",5.0
Jinjer Markley,Functional,"Love it. Great combination of useful information, good advice, moral support, data-based feedback loops, and meaningful rewards. It's lightly game-like, which works well on me. I've lost at least 5 pounds, but more important, I feel noticeably smaller, and most important: it's been fun rather than difficult.",5.0
Nathan Franz,Functional,"Follow directions, see results. The nice thing about Noom is that is changing HOW I interact with food. It is changing my eating habits and I do not feel like I am missing anything. It is just teaching and helping me to make better eating decisions. I tried several others, Ideal Protein, NutriSystem, Etc. Dropped some weight but I hated it. Then I gained the weight back because they never taught me how to change behavior. Noom has. I am dropping about 10lbs per month.",5.0
D Kay,Functional,"Been doing Noom for 4 weeks and I love it. The app is easy to use, with no glitches. They give you recipe ideas. They Teach you all about foods and calories. Daily, short, motivational reads. It's very motivating. The first week I wasn't sure, but I lost enough weight to continue. Now it's been 4 weeks and I've lost 9lbs and I eat 6 times a day! Not all salads either! Noom is great for me!",5.0
Jason Karels,Functional,"With the guidance from the Noom app, I have lost 40 lbs, and have been able to keep it off for the last several months. You can track what you eat, exercise, and water usage. The daily lessons are helpful to me as well. If you are looking for a quick fix, this isn't it. You will have to get that diabetes drug from your doctor or favorite ""shady pharmacist"". There are many add-ons (coaching, etc) available. I am not using them, personally. The basic app has been enough for me.",5.0
Ginger Henson,Functional,"Logging your meals every day, really helps you learn, recognize and change your portion sizes and eating habits. It teaches you about nutrition, green, yellow and orange foods and has great flavorful recipes. I wouldn't call it a diet because no foods are forbidden. It has great motivational tools and the more you exercise, the more calories you get to eat. It makes you look and feel great!",5.0
Amanda McAllister,Functional,"Update : since the most recent update everything is working correctly. I like the changes that have been added such as listening to programs instead of just reading. Original: The concepts are great. I can see myself really changing how I think about eating. HOWEVER The app has been terrible. It crashes all the time. I was told to update, so I did. It got even worse. It's literally crashing my phone. I rated low because I can't even use it consistently because of the app failure.",5.0
Holly Jean,Functional,"The app works pretty well. Every once I a while I see a typos in my courses, but I really appreciate the word play and humor in them. Tracking food is relatively easy, and you can track exercise. There are some exercises that are not on there, and once you add an exercise you can't remove it. Those would be my only problems. Other than that, it works well for losing weight or being healthy.",5.0
Enrique Pineda,Functional,"An extensive, ever-growing food database makes calorie-counting easy and convenient. The psychology-driven approach is a unique and, so far, effective means of helping _stick_ to new habits. Their goal is to help you maintain a healthy lifestyle for the long-term, instead of making weight loss a one-time goal. I'd like to see continued development of thr barcode scanning of foods, as it's rather hit-or-miss. This leaves manual data entry a bit of a chore if the food item is not found.",5.0
Michele Kolar,Functional,"This app is an integral part of my weight loss process. The app can be a little glitchy and it doesn't sync with Samsung smart watches (weird), but I have found a way around it. The app content is great. There are so many ways to monitor changing your habits and they aren't pushy about anything. You log your weight, food/ calories/meals and snacks, exercise, steps, heart rate and other things. It makes it interesting to spend 10 minutes a day seeing the trends (especially the weight loss).",5.0
S Ziems,Functional,"Pros: Really helps you to rethink how you view food. As well as finding those issues that sand bag your diet attempts. The group coach and chat are great for extra motivation and additional insights. Cons: They cut your calories much further than my doctor recommended. Their calorie count on a number of items is very off. They don't give you the ability to add personalized items. Finally, and this maybe my phone, the scanner doesn't always work. Overall I'd definitely recommend it.",5.0
Suzan Hughes-Kennedy,Functional,This app has helped me begin a much needed reboot in losing weight. It's different than the other apps I have used although it required a significant monetary investment. I'll update my review in 6 months but I have already lost 6 pounds in 3 weeks. I just did the update and hate the graphics and the text. Very hard to read. I liked the app a lot because of the graphics and colors. This is awful.,5.0
Alex Rattray,Functional,"Definitely an amazing place to start for building lifelong weight management skills and habits. I'm on track to meet my goals and I thank Noom for that. I've also learned a lot! The app itself is so-so (but don't use that as an excuse!): 1) The cutesy tone is a big turn off for me. They're ""researchers"" not ""nerds"". 2) The UX around calorie tracking is clunky, and since you do it many times a day the annoyances add up. I switched to ""Lose It!"", happily, and still use Noom for the lessons.",5.0
Trina Byrd,Functional,"Great tool for healthy eating. Focus is on changing habits to modify your relationship with food. At first, you won't see progress. I've started noticing that my choices have changed and I've been opting for better choices. Another thing I love about the program is that it allows you to eat what you want and doesn't classify food as bad or good. Simply foods you should eat less or more of. And it's conscious of us being human and very forgiving of slips. Losing weight steadily each week now.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Pro: This is the right app to buy if you didn't learn the basics of eating right when growing up. It will teach you the fundamentals of food from the ground up, in a way that really sticks. If you want to make a life-long change and live longer, this is a perfect spring-board for those who are starting from scratch. Take notes! Con: The starting calorie calculation is way too low for some; remember, you CAN adjust it! Also, the optional meal/exercise plans are NOT worth a penny. Skip them.",5.0
Sue Boughner,Functional,"I lost 50 pounds and have keeps it off for two years! The psychology was life-changing! It took more than the 5 mins a day advertised. That was just enough to get me hooked, but to actually do the work and lose the weight took more time, but sooooo worth it! There are a few minor tech issues, but overall really great app. There's a way to enter home recipes that is time consuming on the front end, but great once it's all in there. I have a BUNCH of personal faves stored. Anyway, I love NOOM!",5.0
Mikiel,Functional,I was very skeptical before starting my Noom Journey. It's been almost 1 month and I'm down 20lbs. I don't even have to think about the calories anymore because Noom's database is so extensive that I just put it in and it adds it. The UI is very user friendly and easy to read. I love the weight graph and the calorie bar at the top of the screen. The daily tasks are also actually informative and helpful (though I disagree with some of their nutrition advice around protein). This is a great app.,5.0
Kate Rouse,Functional,"Nearly half way through, but after sticking to the daily lessons I have noticed major changes in my food choices, motivation and mood. It took a few weeks to see any difference on the scale, but sticking to the daily calorie allowance I have consistently lost a little weight each week, and am finding healthy foods that I look forward to eating. Don't expect overnight change, but I am really happy with the program so far!",5.0
Kori Lyn Price,Functional,"Game changer! I've been using this app for about 2 weeks now. It is exactly what I've needed to finally get it together and lose weight. It keeps you accountable, educational and the psychology aspect is phenomenal! Plus, a personal coach! One suggestion that would be awesome on the app is to add a journal section to our daily tasks. A place where we can take a moment at the end of each day to reflect on our goals, achievements, areas that need attention, what we've learned etc.",5.0
Kelly Garon,Functional,"So far, my experience has been positive. The app itself is easy to use. It includes meal tracking, daily lessons, and a dietitian who all use CBT-based guidance to improve your relationship with food and your body. I have only lost a few pounds, but my choices in food have become healthier the more I challenge my thought distortions which keep me reaching for junk food more often than the good stuff. If you have thought you needed therapy to fix your food issues, this is a good place to start.",5.0
Me Ha,Functional,The app is great. You can log in food and calories so easily! You will get reminders that it is time to log in your meals.The articles are great and not so long that you lose interest. The personality in the articles are entertaining. The app will keep track of steps but is usually way off. There are recipes to explore. My coach doesn't contact me consistently so if that's your case ask for a different one?,5.0
Addie Anders,Functional,"It's only been 2 weeks but I am loving this program and app. It's easy to navigate, many helpful tools if you're truly trying to understand the why and how of your eating and wellness habits. The goal specialists and support are incredible and I'm making changes that are SUSTAINABLE, bit by bit. My only problem is that - unless your phone is on you every second, or you have a name-brand fitness watch, there is no way to keep up w steps without inputting them manually but I highly recommend!",5.0
Shelley Gabbard,Functional,"So far I love it! It's definitely changing my mind about alot of eating habits. Makes me more mindful of things way more often. I'd like to suggest being bale to change coaches... Not to sound mean, she's super nice! But at the beginning when asked what kind of ""coaching help"" I thought I needed... Turns out... I was WRONG! So it would be great to revisit that option and reevaluate, and actually switch it up for what I see (now) that I actually DO need.",5.0
Alyssa Franklin,Functional,"Overall, I'm losing weight and feeling better, so the app works if the entire program is followed. I definitely am shifting how I view food and although I HATED calorie counting, it is making me think about all the foods. The coaches are also help The app is missing a few things: a way to look up calories before logging, percentage of green/yellow/red on the chart, showing pounds lost vs only the trend line, BMI, and a place to record measurements. But I haven't found an app that does all this.",5.0
Libby S,Functional,"Second time through, with a year between. Comparison between the passes is a mixed bag: First time, I didn't know what to expect, and it was a surprise at every turn. I felt like I was making progress constantly. I stopped because I didn't understand how the system was setup - it appears to have 'open studio' after an initial teaching block. Second time: I've gained my 'COVID-19' and I need to address that. The curriculum is moving more quickly, which I appreciate.",5.0
Scott Pratschner (Scott Pratschner),Functional,Update: 6/28/22 (a little later): app issues have been resolved in the latest update! Back to losing weight instead of my mind! ðŸ‘,5.0
Larisa Lynn Ortiz,Functional,"Loving this program! Feeling extremely hopeful. Enjoying the articles learning the ""why"" of many eating habits and helping me recognize the triggers. Only five days and already down 3.6 pounds. The app is very easy to navigate. Small suggestion: Will you please add Figure 8 to your exercise choices? I have started it and don't see it as an option. It's sort of Zumba combined with Latin ballroom dancing and toning techniques. Thanks. Keep up the great work!!",5.0
Dayneris Rodriguez,Functional,"Im a Noomliver! I was very skeptical at first. I tried other calorie counting apps but the results never lasted. Noom is very different; feels different. You are working your motivations behind your struggles, finding new ways to deal with them. You are also made responsible for your own journey & decisions in a way that without trying too hard you are losing weight. The science behind it is very good. The #s can be corny but the techniques are spot on. Ive already lost 4 pounds in first week!",5.0
Patricia Rajnish,Functional,"Having this program at my finger tips, literally because it is in my phone, is what I find immensely helpful. It is a reminder of my weight loss goal, and support and strategies from others is readily at hand. Keeping a food and exercise log is quick and simple. The foods are in the app, the exercise types are in the app, you just select what applies to you.Daily lessons are brief, helpful, and not overwhelming. You still have to put in the effort, but in this day and age of TECH, Noom delivers.",5.0
Wendy Philyaw,Functional,"I LOVE NOOMing! Why did it take me so long to do this?! The app is user friendly, tracking is so easy that I actually find myself enjoying it, & no ads to bombard me! I love having a real live coach vs just automated replies. And most of all, this feels nothing like a diet whatsoever! I can take it at my own pace, set my own goals, and I'm learning a new lifestyle I can sustain! If you're on the fence, at least give yourself the gift of the free trial. You won't regret it!ðŸ˜Š",5.0
Heidi Reinhard,Functional,A year later as 2020 was a difficult time for us all so a refresher was the right choice for me. Noom's updated program with a new format is more streamlined. They cite their sources less frequently than the previous ( or maybe first timers run thru ?) This makes it less cluttered. But still includes motivational & psych tips that one tailors to their own life. It really is an individual plan because it's all in your head and your hands to make change. And the support is always great!,5.0
Stella Arbelaez,Functional,"This is my 4th week using Noom. The articles have been informative and engaging. I was pleasantly surprised when the personal coach popped up and shortly after, a support group made of people who had started the program around the same time as I had. It is really nice to have a place to check in, let out thoughts and get feedback from people who are going thru the same issues. The graphics help visual peeps. My approach to weight loss is evolving, and that is awesome!",5.0
Kelley O'Neill,Functional,"I cant say enough good things about this app, and my overall experience with Noom. I've been using this program for just shy of a month, and I've lost 19 lbs already, most of which came off with diet changes alone, not much exercising done! This is completely different from other weight loss apps, in that it tackles the psychology of bad eating habits, and breaks those down, to develop good habits that can last a lifetime. I absolutely love this app and highly recommend it!",5.0
Katy Rogers,Functional,"Noom is by far the best weight loss strategy I've tried. The articles are extremely informative but kept funny and lighthearted and very easy to get through. Using the app is easy. I get a little frustrated with errors in the food library when tracking, but it's no worse than when I was using another app, and this app allows me to report errors immediately. I actually used Noom about a year ago and some things have changed for the better, including the ability to add your own recipes.",5.0
Martha Martha,Functional,"I haven't used any other weight loss app. This one is great because it helps change my thinking about food to change my habits. It tracks calories, exercise, weight, and has a built in step counter. I feel more in control of my food choices, thinner, and the scales showing the results too even after only using one week now. Update: after about a month and a half the scale is continuing to show the results of my efforts changing the way I think about food based on all the psychology tricks.",5.0
Casey McClain,Functional,"First app that I have stuck with for meal logging and health tracking for more than a month. Very easy to use, and focus on psychology and food intelligence makes weight loss much easier. I am able to make better decisions utilizing the knowledge I have rather than sticking to restrictive diets and exercise regimens. I am currently down 21 pounds in a 6 weeks. So it defintiely works as well and I haven't even made as many physical changes as I wanted to at this point.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Very easy-to-use color coded food groups make it easy to get started. Lots of support. It really makes you stop and think about eating and why you're eating what you are eating. You can have chats with coaches/guides and get immediate answers to your questions. Recipes, water tracking, and foods listed come with portions already available to choose from. Libraries to listen to past informational and motivational information always at your fingertips. Highly recommend.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've tried several other weight loss plans, I like this best, and it is working the best. It is based on sound science, has a fun and happy atmosphere, and is full of educational tips, feedback on one's food choices, support, and a gentle amount of accountability. It has an excellent food search for tracking what you eat. Cost is quite reasonable.",5.0
Pamela Delzeith,Functional,"It works !! I've been doing Noom for a month and have lost 8 pounds!! It's the only thing I could follow. Please know - I HATE vegetables, and guess what - I'm not eating any!! I've learned to eat smarter - moderation, a little exercise and focusing more on the fruits I like. This is SO simple. And the informational courses (a couple minutes each) are fun and positive. It's changing my mindset and I'm more aware of what to eat, but I've eaten everything I want to, including a little chocolate.",5.0
Whitney Lockhart,Functional,"So far I find it very helpful. Even without a group I find being able to log my foods and keep an eye on the food categories extremely helpful at changing my lifestyle for the healthier. I like how the program focuses on whole life changes like getting more sleep, reducing stress, mindfulness and swapping better choices in for unhealthy ones. Nothing is ""off-limits"" but it focuses on small changes over time.",5.0
A Google user,Functional,"Exceeds expectations Of course everyone's experience are different and I was just looking for something to give me tips on how to lose weight faster then my 1/2 lb/week. It increased my awareness of calorie intake and portion size in a refreshing, different way. It gave useful psych tips most people don't think of when losing weight. One main focus it aids in is food tracking. With a huge database of food/condiments/drinks/etc., I am able to quickly log my daily meals. Definitely a plus for me!",5.0
Diffy 1991,Functional,"It's early on still, but noom is very easy to use and figure out. With short easy lessons and clear tools and set up, it takes a lot of stress out of it. You still have to put in the work of watching what you eat and exercising, but it takes the guess work out and is very informative. EDIT: Noom may be pricier than other options, but if you put the work in and are consistent, it helps you create a healthier lifestyle, and not just a temporary diet that you fall off of.",5.0
Jocelyn Swenson,Functional,"*Edit. After the issues i had signing up i got an automatic email from Noom. I clicked the link and it connected oitside the app and most of my answers had been retained. Since that point the app has worked very well. You might want to sign up on a computer and use the app after that. ""If the app can't handle a micro-second of interruption, or at least retain the answers I've already given, I'm not going to pay $179 with any confidence that I'll be able to access it when I need it.""",5.0
Elizabeth Chamberlain,Functional,"I am very much enjoying the Noom experience. I love how lessons and introductions to the apps tools are broken down into bite-sized pieces. They also have the most inclusive and extensive food list I've ever used, as well as the ability to add your own items in. Love the colours and the graphics. I appreciate the ability to read and have it read to me. All the trackers in one place. Oh, and did I mention live coaches to ask questions and support? Wishing I signed up sooner. Excellent app",5.0
Sandra Coulter,Functional,"I've tried Noom for the trial period off and on for a few years now. At first, I found it a bit goofy. But, over the years, the app has really improved. Also, I have come to appreciate the phychology behind this program. It's a good solid program. I would have purchased it much sooner, but I locked myself into a monthly subscription with WW I couldn't get out of. Yet another thing Noom is doing better. I appreciate the one and done annual payment (or you can choose other options).",5.0
Kristin Kostreva,Functional,I'm a few days into my trial and I'm pretty happy. I like how they incorporate articles to help you understand habits and triggers that make you a more mindful eater. The food color chart and tracker is also really nice! I never realized how much my diet consisted of certain foods and they have recipes for some new ideas with better options. I don't feel hungry and I've already lost a few lbs. ðŸ˜,5.0
John Tucker,Functional,"I believe I will keep the lost weight off, as there is so much flexibility in losing weight. My preference is generally skipping breakfast (intermittent fasting) because I prefer saving for more substantial meals later, but equally it does accommodate those who prefer small meals with healthy snacks in between. And I can still have curry, cheese and peanuts, 3 of my weaknesses! I'm not finding the changes difficult and I'm not going hungry. The latter has sometimes been a theme on other diets",5.0
Kim Kohler,Functional,Food tracking has been the easiest one of all the apps and other programs I tried following in the past. It's also more educational than judgemental . The coaches check in on you to see how you are doing and always reply in a timely fashion as promised. I've only been doing this for less than a week but I have already seen big changes in my habits and thinking. The little lessons make sense and are easy to follow.,5.0
Anna Kovalenko,Functional,"2nd time a charm! lots to love about the app. 1st time I bailed as paid version seemed expensive. however, as this was the only app with which I properly lost weight & improved habits, later during difficult post partum weight recovery, I bought the 4 month subscription. What I love: 1) their psychological approach is truly kind, sane, long term sustainable. Just complete the lectures! 2) food logging- simple and very flexible (helps cement habits), 3) syncing with e-scales & Fitbit: min effort",5.0
Sharyn Unitt,Functional,"I will admit the first couple of days took some adjusting to, due to the constant need to log in daily intake (except for the odd rest day) but overall this app has been a fantastic tool to help keep myself accountable to the goals I want to achieve. The support chat service is prompt and will endeavour to answer every question. I like the motivational messages, nutritional advice and psychological aspects as to how the program is constructed. Definitely a valuable tool for anyone!",5.0
Douglas Kilmer,Functional,"This app works great; it, helps you to make the lifestyle changes required for permanent weight loss, teaches you the science of nutrition, teaches you how to make good food choices, and teaches you how to manage your weight before it bounces back and becomes out of control. The coaching feature is a big help and I highly recommend it.",5.0
Bonnie Sax,Functional,"As a health coach and a graduate of more diets than I can recall, Noom is an easy, simple and fun way to get more information about food, make better decisions around regular food and accomplish your weight loss goals. I highly recommend it. It's the closest thing to perfect I've found.",5.0
Dublin's Farm (DublinsFarm),Functional,"It is early in my journey... But I am learning a lot of tools that are really working. The only thing I wish is the availability of phone support with the coaches. But they do respond quickly, texting through the app. When it comes to logging meals, I was dreading it. BUT this app makes it completely painless. Truly love Noom!!!",5.0
Sarah Matheson,Functional,"It's such a great app that doesn't only help you lose weight it also helps you understand what foods to eat . It gives you little quizzes to see how & if you understand everything. I've never dieted before.

Claire Glisson,Functional,"It was easy to get excited about joining noom & using it to kick start that motivation to get healthier. It's been just as easy to stick with it. Rather than changing your time & schedule to conform to what the program needs, the program adapts to you. I started saying I could only commit 5 minutes a day to lessons but now doing double that. Weekly progress reports give you more than weight loss- it tells you how your diet has improved for other healthy inspo. Noom coaches are helpful & amazing!",5.0
Alex Balexis,Functional,"After my first review, they understood our situation and gave us a full refund after just 2 days. The app is not suited for her lifestyle, but now we have a good vibe about Noom! After one month (of six) , my wife stopped using the app. She also changed the credit card, the old one is no longer available. Two days ago, the new card was charged 89 euros. We asked for at least a partial refund, they said they can't refund us. They offered her 45% discount for the next subscription. What a joke!",5.0
Sherrie Reinking,Functional,Helps to keep you on track with your calories and what groups your food belongs to. VERY EASY TO FOLLOW! Lessons and coaches to guide you and best of all IT WORKS!

You can even have sweet treats in moderation!,5.0
Naomi Paul,Functional,"One way ticket to a healthy lifestyle! The information given is different and fun; and most importantly keeps me interested and excited for the next day. And, yes! I have seen results already during my first week. No app issues, works great. Thanks Noom!",5.0
Cheryl Richardson,Functional,"I like how the calorie count is calculated for each individual, and creates a losing zone that allows for more calories than most standard diets, so I'm not afraid of slowing my metabolism. I get quick help through the message support chat within the app. I'm surprised at how much the 5-8 minute readings help me just when I need them.",5.0
Janette Matcham,Functional,"Noom is Excellent, informative and supportive. A journey of discovering how to have a better relationship with the food we eat and food choices we make. The emphasis is more on this rather than soley on the amount of weight loss, but it is working for me. I've lost 1 stone in the last month and starting to develop better habits with food and feel so much more in control of what I eat.",5.0
Kathy,Functional,Wonderful experience. I've always had trouble following and sticking to diets. This is easy to use and follow. Helps you to learn and change your ways of thinking. Coaches are very helpful. Sends out recipes to show you how to prep and plan. The reminders keep me on track.,5.0
Manizheh erfanian sabaee,Functional,"I know there are a lot of other apps doing the same, but this one keeps me motivated by mini courses it has, a lot of topics i already know but to hear it every day it keeps me on track, i have started about a month ago and i have lost 2.5 kg, i have a long way to go, but i have got a good feeling this time!",5.0
I Just Believe!,Functional,"I was looking for a program that would teach me nutrition (i.e. healthy alternatives, etc.). I'd been playing with subscribing to Noom for about a year, until I finally decided to give it a try. I'm in my 7-day free trial period and I've already gained knowledge and an understanding of foods that I can have in abundance verses those I can still have but in moderation. I really like that Noom does not teach a restrictive lifestyle but a healthy balance. So far, I've lost four pounds.",5.0
Brenda Ramstadius,Functional,very good app. Im doing the 2 week free trial first and it has been fantastic at kick starting me back on track. I had been deliberating for 6 months or more about restarting a healthier weight plan. Starting Noom had me instantly back on track and motivatedðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,5.0
Chris Brooks,Functional,"Winna winna chicken dinna. So i am soooo thankful that this site found me. Honestly, i wasn't looking for yet another ""diet loss"" program that would be an additional cost every month, then buying their products. But this is so different. NOOM gives you tips and hacks on living a healthier lifestyle. There are no good/ bad foods, just goods we can eat plenty, foods we eat in moderation, and foods we eat scarcely for a lack of a better word. Each can't wait to open the app. As of 11/7 down 10 lbs.",5.0
katsam2002,Functional,"Excellent program if you are looking for a plan that is long term. You have to commit to logging meals, daily weigh ins and reading daily lessons No food is off limits. Noom emphasizes enjoying food in moderation, eating balanced meals and steering away from good food/bad food concept. The program syncs with my fit bit. I use android and have not had any technical issues. I see Apple users commenting on the group chats that they experience technical difficulties with logging meals. I recommend.",5.0
Jessica Visser,Functional,"I love Noom and its concept of changing habits into healthy habits for life. I've done restrictive dieting and as a nursing mother I knew that was certainly not the way to go. I feel like Noom is a healthy, realistic option that actually helps you lose weight and understand why you eat when and how much you eat. Also, it works. The UI is also great.",5.0
Denise Wood,Functional,"So far, so good. It has only been a week but I am down a little already. I like the lessons and the food tracker. I have only had to add a few things, most are already in. My new step watch does not link, I didn't check before I bought, but it can be entered manually. (Can't carry phone at work)",5.0
Susan Mccarthy,Functional,I've tried every diet over the past 40 years. Noom is the only one that has helped me to understand food and appreciate it rather than think it's my enemy. It has taught me to evaluate what I need for my body whilst tracking what I eat and make better decisions but also eating the foods I enjoy and having treats. I'd highly recommend giving it gobit certainly works for me .,5.0
lauren Trezise,Functional,Incredibly supportive. Calories found and you can find portions in different weights. Lots of learning experiences and ways to modify your thinking. I found it very helpful.,5.0
Elizabeth B,Functional,"Easy to follow, helps me understand and change my eating patterns, rather than just focusing on eating less and feeling deprived. With Noom Med I learned that I have pre-diabetes and am insulin resistant, which was really driving a lot of my sugar cravings and binges. With that being treated it has been easier to focus on positive behavior changes",5.0
C Armieri,Functional,"I had started it a couple of weeks ago, then I stopped after a couple of days. I stopped opening app in the morning. It helps having notifications pop up to remind you. The real trick is to keep opening the notifications and stick with the program. Don't give up. When you wake up, open your wake up notification and read in bed. Then start your day.",5.0
Luis Salinas,Functional,Very useful! Their large food database and the guidance for portion size make it easier to track calories. It also tracks number of steps. So overall very good experience. The app easily connects with other apps to track steps. Support is really good.,5.0
Hannelie Groenewald,Functional,"Nothing worked for me...until I discovered Noom. I'm not dieting. I'm eating mindfully and counting calories. I still mostly eat yellow and orange foods but within the boundaries set. And I'm losing weight...slowly, but constantly. I am convinced that I will reach my goal. I'm still in the trial period, and while Noom is really expensive, I consider buying it. Sometimes it is a bit annoying to log smaller amounts of food, since there are no units eg. 100ml. You have to log 1/2 cup.",5.0
Victoria Savage,Functional,"Great support and guidance, healthy options for things you enjoy great encouragement to stay on track but to also indulge in your occasional treats without feeling guilty. My team even send me prompts to not skip meals (which i have in the past) and care about how you are feeling both physically and mentally throughout your journey.Your team is always there if you need one on one support to answer and questions or concerns and really empower you to achieve your goal.",5.0
D Wilson,Functional,"I was skeptical at first that it would really work so I did the free trial. A little less than a year later and I have lost 90 lbs. It really does work and for me, it has been life changing.",5.0
Deb Teikamata,Functional,Noom has got me back on track. I totally recommend it. One criticism is that it's USA based and when logging food you often have to break everything down.,5.0
Holly Wood,Functional,"Very helpful! I tried it before, and it seemed like a naggy mom. I got tired of it and quit. I really like the changes. It is more ""Game-a-fiedl and fun. I like the way you can decide how much to read, too. They've made good changes. It's much more helpful and motivating. I am confident that I'll be successful losing weight and keeping it off this time.",5.0
Cleo Dennis,Functional,"This app is easy to use. The instructions are very clear. I like ALL of it, especially that you can delete a food item that you choose but later decide differently. You delete anytime BEFORE ending the day. I like the thoughtful lessons you get. The one to three minute lengths are enough to keep you listening. If you're a reader you can read instead. This feature is great also. A+++ NOOM!!",5.0
Manizheh erfanian sabaee,Functional,"I know there are a lot of other apps doing the same, but this one keeps me motivated by mini courses it has, a lot of topics i already know but to hear it every day it keeps me on track, i have started about a month ago and i have lost 2.5 kg, i have a long way to go, but i have got a good feeling this time!",5.0
Lisa Fletcher,Functional,I struggled with weight all my life. This is the only thing that has helped me. 16 kilos off in 12 weeks and seriously owe it to Noom. Love this program ðŸ¤,5.0
llagoons,Functional,"I find Noom to be very engaging. I'm a self-motivated person, so this program works well for me. I find the 1-3 minute courses to be educational. I prefer the structure of logging my food and weight daily, but I appreciate it is not a requirement. I definitely recommend this program to anyone trying to become mindful about making healthier eating choices.",5.0
Abigail Rockett,Functional,"I am a nurse practitioner. I hate it, but it works. Noom puts the foods you choose to eat into three categories. It does make me mindful of my food choices. I also hate the psychological lessons, but they work too. I can't log certain activities like beach walking, but in the long run it really doesn't matter. It is a great program that is refreshingly not incentivised by pre made foods and supplements.",5.0
Sandra Airey,Functional,"I've tried many diets but this one, after a series of questions at the beginning, designed a programme suitable for me. One I can stick to and started losing weight within the first week.",5.0
Bonnie Sax,Functional,"As a health coach and a graduate of more diets than I can recall, Noom is an easy, simple and fun way to get more information about food, make better decisions around regular food and accomplish your weight loss goals. I highly recommend it. It's the closest thing to perfect I've found.",5.0
Elizabeth Chamberlain,Functional,"I am very much enjoying the Noom experience. I love how lessons and introductions to the apps tools are broken down into bite-sized pieces. They also have the most inclusive and extensive food list I've ever used, as well as the ability to add your own items in. Love the colours and the graphics. I appreciate the ability to read and have it read to me. All the trackers in one place. Oh, and did I mention live coaches to ask questions and support? Wishing I signed up sooner. Excellent app",5.0
Sherrie Reinking,Functional,Helps to keep you on track with your calories and what groups your food belongs to. VERY EASY TO FOLLOW! Lessons and coaches to guide you and best of all IT WORKS! I've lost 5 pounds in the first week and I eat more than I normally do! Thanks to Noom I don't starve my body and it teaches me the value of food and my limitations. You can even have sweet treats in moderation!,5.0
laura tunnicliffe,Functional,"Understanding the psychology of food decisions is really helpful. Nothing banned or off the menu, lots of encouragement and able to make my own mindful choices around food. This is a long term mindful eating plan, not a faddy diet and it really works.",5.0
Jenn Wanders,Functional,"The app is easy to navigate, being able to scan labels makes logging meals easier, and the coaches check in and offer support and requested resources every couple of days!",5.0

Brenda Ramstadius,Functional,very good app. Im doing the 2 week free trial first and it has been fantastic at kick starting me back on track. I had been deliberating for 6 months or more about restarting a healthier weight plan. Starting Noom had me instantly back on track and motivatedðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚,5.0
E C,Functional,"This has helped me quite a bit so far, I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to lose weight and learn the science behind it to help you develop proper eating habits!",5.0
Sandra Coulter,Functional,"I've tried Noom for the trial period off and on for a few years now. At first, I found it a bit goofy. But, over the years, the app has really improved. Also, I have come to appreciate the phychology behind this program. It's a good solid program. I would have purchased it much sooner, but I locked myself into a monthly subscription with WW I couldn't get out of. Yet another thing Noom is doing better. I appreciate the one and done annual payment (or you can choose other options).",5.0
Amanda Zimmerman,Functional,"My experience with Noom has been like no other..it feels like a best friend, encouraging me. I've lost 5 pounds in 5 days , something I wasn't able to do on my own. It keeps me accountable and I've learned so much about myself and what I choose to eat. It's not strict or rigid and that I find key. Love it",5.0
Nessa Soffe,Functional,"A fantastic app; so much information, such detailed feedback, great articles. So helpful for anyone looking to eat healthily and/or reduce weight. Only downside is cost; very expensive!",5.0
Michelle Nicholson,Functional,Not only am I starting to loose weight for the first time in a very long time but it feels like I am beginning to understand my weight loss journey. I feel like I can stick with this and it will make a truly positive impact on my life. I can do this so can you.,5.0
John Leger,Functional,Simple psychology paired with an intuitive app for tracking the foods you eat. No food are off limits. I've lost 10 in the first month. I highly recommend Noom for those sick of the diet fads who are looking for more of a lifestyle change.,5.0
Jeffrey Wellman,Functional,This app is helping me learn to control my eating and track my activity so that I am more successful in loosing weight. I have never been as successful in reducing my weight as I have been since signing up with Noom. Thank you Noom!,5.0
Heather Jackson,Functional,"I have used Noom twice. My first time was incredible and exactly what I was looking for. I came back looking for the same experience, and it was even better than the first time! Sadly, the second time was cut short, and I had to cancel my subscription for personal reasons. Thankfully, the support team was incredible and was very helpful and made everything super easy! Noom is amazing, and I will be rejoining in the future! #grapes",5.0
Kristin Kostreva,Functional,I'm a few days into my trial and I'm pretty happy. I like how they incorporate articles to help you understand habits and triggers that make you a more mindful eater. The food color chart and tracker is also really nice! I never realized how much my diet consisted of certain foods and they have recipes for some new ideas with better options. I don't feel hungry and I've already lost a few lbs. ðŸ˜,5.0
Kimberly Brooks,Functional,"This is working for me like nothing else ever has. It helps if you have a buddy, but you don't have to. The more things you participate in, the better. And if you stick to mostly green foods in the earlier parts of the day, the better you do about not going too far over your ""zone"". If you're willing to do the work, this will really help you.",5.0
Dublin's Farm (DublinsFarm),Functional,"It is early in my journey... But I am learning a lot of tools that are really working. The only thing I wish is the availability of phone support with the coaches. But they do respond quickly, texting through the app. When it comes to logging meals, I was dreading it. BUT this app makes it completely painless. Truly love Noom!!!",5.0
Stephanie Birkett,Functional,"Just started, one month, learning so much about how thoughts affect eating, slowly breaking really bad eating habits, keeping track keeps me on track, so far, so good, I believe this will work for the 'long' haul .. try it .. to be continued ..ðŸ˜‹",5.0
Ashley Eltasse,Functional,"Noon it very educational and the mentors are super helpfull and always there to encourage you. If you stick with it and follow their plan or the plan you set up for yourself, there is no way you won't reach your goals.",5.0
Tiffany Marquez,Functional,"It's not only weight loss support, it's no shame or blame, it's ""treat"" instead of ""cheat"" days. It's taking into account how psychological food experiences can be for people. It's gentle mental health AND nutrition support in one. It's laughter and being present with yourself through any emotion that comes up. It shows what a healthy relationship with food can be...it opens the door, but you get to make the choice to walk in.",5.0
Nicole Brown,Functional,Noom is so fun and helpful. It's motivating and encouraging. I highly recommend it. I'm learning so much about nutrition and about own eating habits. They don't slash your calorie intake like Jenny Craig or bother you with point systems like WW.,5.0
Kim Kohler,Functional,Food tracking has been the easiest one of all the apps and other programs I tried following in the past. It's also more educational than judgemental . The coaches check in on you to see how you are doing and always reply in a timely fashion as promised. I've only been doing this for less than a week but I have already seen big changes in my habits and thinking. The little lessons make sense and are easy to follow.,5.0
Naomi Paul,Functional,"One way ticket to a healthy lifestyle! The information given is different and fun; and most importantly keeps me interested and excited for the next day. And, yes! I have seen results already during my first week. No app issues, works great. Thanks Noom!",5.0
Tanya B,Functional,"I can't get past the lack of control, inability to stop the app or its sounds, & the layering of more sounds when I open the app. For example, I liked to listen to an ocean soundscape. In the morning, couldn't stop the sound, had to pause from the notification bar & then kill all running apps. I connect to my car's bluetooth, the ocean starts up again, even though I didn't open the app. When I did open the app, there were cricket sounds I couldn't stop, layered over the ocean. Enough. Bye.",1.0
Justin Harner,Functional,"Very, very little content for free. And the little bit that is available is only intros to multi-part selections. So although there seemed to be a lot of content, I didn't even bother looking at it because I had to sort through so many ""lock"" icons overlapping everything you can pick. If you have money to spend, but 1 star for me, horrible first impression.",1.0
Andra Clark,Functional,"I love the sleep stories. But the app itself has gotten progressively worse over the two years I have been using it. It is slow and clunky and the user interface has gotten cluttered and cumbersome. I repeatedly report my unhappiness with the ""improvements"" but nothing changes. I ask for the ability to customize - nope. The latest update has pretty much rendered it unusable on my tablet. It tries to open and just shuts right back down. This is definitely not calming. Edit: Still not fixed",1.0
Robert McClurg,Functional,"I've been using the Calm app for several months now, but the most recent update has left it extreme buggy. Meditations quit working before they are finished. Backround sounds dissappear or pop in and out. Background images go black. Whatever happened in the most recent update has really messed up the functionality of this great app. This is really disappointing. It has been such a great tool for me. Now I find it super distracting. this is exactly the opposite of what this app is supposed to be",1.0
Daniel Shostak,Functional,"Not only is the interface absolutely not user friendly (horrible counterintuitive navigation), but I was just thrown off by extreme battery drainage in a time when I haven't opened the app in a very long time. It's running in the background as if my life depends on it. I wanted to give this service a try after hearing words of praise, but it just wasn't useable. Uninstalled the app",1.0
Netanel Matkowsky,Functional,"Marketed as having a free version, almost everything is locked. I needed a relaxation app, but you can't use soundscapes, stories, music, or narrations without paying. There is only, and I literally can't emphasize this enough, ONE MEDITATION THAT YOU CAN USE WITHOUT PAYING FOR PREMIUM. Let me give you an example of how frustrating this is, Netflix, which has no relation to this app, tells you that you can't use their app without a subscription, this pretends you don't need one. Very upset.",1.0
Emma Searcy,Functional,"Installed it and signed up for the trial because everything is locked if you don't, I went to click on one of the options that looked intresting, and it started playing something totally different. The sounds wouldn't turn off, then the app stopped working completely. Trying to fix it, I closed and reopened the calm app just to have it frozen on the ""take a deep breath"" screen. Nice to see them putting all their money into the ads for the app rather than the app itself.",1.0
Brett Harris,Functional,"The app is worthless because you can't make custom playlists. There's stories, music, nature sounds, etc... And I discovered a book narrator I really like, but I can't just play her stuff until I fall asleep. It's absolutely stupid to not have this feature. It should have been there since day one, but the devs don't know or don't care how to make a functional app. You can't fall asleep if you're clicking the next thing to play every thirty minutes like an even dumber version of Lost.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Not worth it. Drains battery at an alarming rate and needs to be forced closed every time. Somehow the icon even jitters around when you try to hold down and uninstall it, have to uninstall through play store. You have access to very few choices and sounds with the free version anyway. Paid version is $60 for one year. It's too bad because the app looks great and the tracks i could listen to sounded good, but it's just broken in such a way that it effects phone functionality in general. Note 8.",1.0
Beth Brightman,Functional,"Misleading!!! ""Calm is free to download and use. There are never any ads and some of the programs and features are free forever. Some content is only available through an optional paid subscription"" This is a lie! I downloaded and everything is locked. There is not a free item to use at all! If your items are only free to use during a trial period then just say so up front. Honestly is appreciated by people. This should have said try it free for 7 days then continue with a subscription.",1.0
Maria Vasquez,Functional,"I don't like the app being hidden behind a paywall. I tried the soundscapes but I found myself wanting to keep some sounds but not others. Some sounds that are better with headphones, could also have a little symbol on the corner for easier view. I want to be able to customize my sounds, based on mood, time of day, and what I hope to achieve with listening to Calm. Theres just too much going on within the app and nothing to lead you in right direction.",1.0
Jennifer K,Functional,It used to be great but now it's a HUGE disappointment! I had calm a year ago and I loved it....I mostly used it for the relaxing sounds. I just downloaded it onto a new device and it asks you to either do a 7-day free trial or pay around $70 to have access. I didn't want to pay such a huge amount when I had used it for free before....but sadly you can't use 95% of the options unless you pay. I'm 100% disappointed!. :(,1.0
Annie Martinez,Functional,"Had been using this app for about a year and it was great. Was able to favorite some songs I liked for meditation, calming anxiety or falling asleep. There was plenty to listen to for free. Now I open the app and everything is locked! I'm not paying $70 a year for content I was already getting for free. Disappointed because theres some songs I really like in this app, but there are better apps out there with way more content for free. Gotta uninstall. ðŸ˜•",1.0
Eilir773,Functional,"The first few times I used it, the app drained my phone completely before I could even relax. I'm sure I cancelled the subscription/free trial. Then this year I was charged the recurring charge of nearly $70, with NO reminder email to see if I wanted to continue or that it was even happening. So now I'm completely the opposite of Calm. I was able to cancel the sub. but I could not find out how to get a refund. The site is so confusing. Not recommended.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app used to be amazing. The updated version, however seems to be all about the money. The rain on leaves theme isnt new. It use to be one of the basic ones I listened to all of the time and it didnt cost anything. I can see where the additional trainings may cost some money, but the older sounds? No thanks. update:The developer's response was not helpful. I downloaded the app again to make sure I was accessing the desired content. The sound ""rain on leaves"" is the one that is not free anymore",1.0
Abbey Emmert,Functional,"I was excited to try this app out, I love the ideas of music, sounds, and stories being available to listen to when looking to relax. Unfortunately, after the free download, I realized that nothing available unless I subscribe for an annual fee! I can do a free trial for 7 days; however, I don't like to sign up for trials all of the time and am really not interested in paying another subscription. Deleting the app, will find something else.",1.0
NR Macklin,Functional,"I've had this app on one phone or another for the last few years. Calm went from being able to choose among soundscapes and thematic backgrounds for free to charging for almost 80% of content, to ultimately being a FULL-PAY app. I wouldn't mind paying $60/year if I wanted to take advantage of all the narrations and music, but I was only here for the crickets and campfire. Sorry to see it go from my phone, but it can never be worth the price of admission for me.",1.0
Casey Sibley,Functional,"No way to cancel free trial. The app seems nice and well designed, but after trying it out for the free trial, decided it wasn't for me (the ONLY way to get any idea of the value of the content, btw...there are no free options available unless you sign up for the trial). I am trying to cancel before I get charged $69 for an app I don't want, but it is impossible to cancel through Calm and when I try to manage my subscription through Google Play, it is not showing up. Feeling PLAYED.",1.0
Erik Larson,Functional,"Downloaded to hear more ""brown noise"" that was advertised on a tv commercial, since the app was free.. but once I opened it, before showing me anything about how it might work, it asks me to subscribe to a $69.99 annual subscription. When I click close on that screen another opens to offer me ""today only"", 40% of at $41.99. As near as I can tell only one sound is available without paying for their subscription. Bait and switch. Free app, but you have to pay a subscription fee to try and use it.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"I was immediately charged the yearly fee of $59. I was under the assumption that I wouldn't be charged unless I surpassed the 7 day free trial period. This is a rip off. I only downloaded the app 5 days ago and went to cancel the ""free trial"" I thought and then saw that my ""subscription"" will renew August 12, 2020. Checked my bank account and sure enough I was already charged the yearly fee. The app is useful but there are cheaper apps out there that have similar features. Not worth the money.",1.0
Jennifer Ocon (Jen),Functional,"App stops working while listening to sleep stories. I've been a subscriber for quite awhile, for some reason in the last couple months, the app just shuts down while listening to the sleep stories.

A Google user,Functional,"Really loved this app, until you decided to take everything away and turn it premium only. I understand you have to make money. Thats why I didn't begrudge little ads on my screen, or that some of the features (maybe half of the songs) were a premium only feature. But to go and change the conditions under which I downloaded the app, to lock all but 2 songs when previously there was a decent amount for free, is lame. It was an instant uninstall for me.",1.0
Tanner Thomas,Functional,"What in the world has this app come to. Am I remembering wrong that they didn't used to shove the subscription down your throat. I downloaded the app while having a mild anxiety attack, looking for soundscapes. I couldn't find a single free one. I remember using this app, and it being mostly soundscapes and they were all free, and you could download them. But this time all I could find was people speaking, which made more anxious. I am terribly disappointed!",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Tried the free trial and wasn't a fan. Forgot to cancel and the subscription auto-charged for 1 year! Would recommend the developers of this app offer shorter subscriptions that would then be used as the default when auto-enrolling, post-free trial. Also, transparency that the end of a user's free trial is upcoming will likely save you a lot of support time in assisting with cancelling unwanted auto-subscriptions. This could be as simple as an email 24-48 hours prior to the end of the trial period.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"The bait and switch pricing of this ""calming"" app made my blood boil. When you open the app is says 7 day free trial, then $47.99 per year. When you hit subscribe, the price changes to $69.99 per year. Stay away! Edit: Your response missed the point. I didn't get an unintended charge, I'm complaining about the $22 difference in advertised price vs. the price you attempted to charge. False advertising!",1.0
Brogan Houston,Functional,"I don't care about all the sleep stories, I just use the app for the white noise. Frequently throughout the night, I'll have the white noise playing and it will just stop for no apparent reason, even when I have the timer set for 8 hours. I'll open the app to resume the sound, and the stupid pop-up windows come up saying, ""Great Job!"" and it doesn't let me close those windows for a good few seconds, allowing me to fully wake up before I can get my white noise going again. Very frustrating.",1.0
Nam Eric Doan,Functional,"Calm does not turn off if you disconnect headphones. This presents an issue if you're using BT headphones and are listening to Soundscapes, which play perpetually, and will waste your phone's battery. Basically, it doesn't behave like every other app that plays audio behaves. The offerings themselves are nice but the UI is very clunky. For example in the Meditation tab, you have to scroll all the way to the right just to see offerings from guest instructors.",1.0
Sarcastic Robot,Functional,"There's nothing calming about being met with a survey, getting to the content only to find that most of it requires an account or subscription, or thinking you found an activity only to slam into another wall when trying to save or complete it. So much for relaxation. Or ethics. I didn't see captions on the one video series I did find. Slow screen transitions are frustrating. I really wanted to like this app, but this was beyond disappointing.",1.0
J G (Jessy),Functional,"I agree with previous reviews, there is very little content available for free. Also, whatever is available for free is nearly impossible to find. I literally ended up more stressed after swiping around endlessly trying to find something to help me relax. Nearly everything has a padlock symbol on it. It was pretty frustrating which defeats the purpose of why I downloaded the app in the first place. Definitely misleading, if you're not willing to pay, don't even bother.",1.0
Joey R. Navarro,Functional,"PLEASE make it easier to navigate to your favorites and finding the meditations you actually want. Finding what you want, when you want it, is cumbersome.

William McFarland (Rev. Zareh),Functional,"It's all about premium service. There is hardly anything free and what there is contains speaking. I just want some relaxing sounds/music without narration.

For these reasons, I am deleting the app.",1.0
Guitar Man,Functional,"False advertising. Beware. Claims most features are free but I could not find a single thing that didn't require a payment. Literally every single thing had a lock icon on it.

Garbage. Uninstalled immediately.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Terrible app for many reasons. It will pause by itself a minute into an 8 hour sound session all the time. It won't save all your favorites. The diversity in the soundscapes is not good, you get a couple nature sounds and that's about it. Also I tried to send them a refund request and the app wouldn't let me.

Erin Bong,Functional,"I really tried to like this app but it has had so many problems since the minute I downloaded it. First, the ""breathe"" bubble doesn't work for me at all. It doesn't even tell you when to breath in or out like it's supposed to, it just plays the music. Second, I loved using the soundscapes to fall asleep, but they randomly stop while I'm asleep and it wakes me up (even when I have the sleep timer on). I've tried updating my phone and making sure the app doesn't have the battery optimizer.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Doesn't seem to have any guided meditation. Also, for a relaxation app, the interface is very hectic and overwhelming, and starts playing some loud forest sounds by default without any quick/easy way to turn it off.

Jennifer Brooks,Functional,"I've had this app for years and have loved the free options. There are certain ones I listen to when I sleep or meditate. I recently upgraded my phone and in so doing have learned that there are no free options anymore. Very frustrating, & poor service as they won't fix it. I had to go on my old phone, change downloaded pieces to ogg files, save them in my music folder, and transfer to my new phone that way. But I won't be using Calm anymore. ðŸ™„",1.0
Nicole Kramer,Functional,Was very disappointed to see an annual subscription (and rather pricey too) as the only way to access the large majority of features. Found three 37 minute videos as the only items available without the subscription.

Tess A.,Functional,"At first, I LOVED the app. It was the best way for me to fall asleep quickly. Then, after a couple of months, it was all gone. All of it. All locked by ""Calm Premium"". There isn't one single sleep song that isn't locked by ""Calm Premium"". Unless you want to spend 14.99 a month or 69.99 a year on relaxing music you can get on YouTube for free. I wouldn't recommend. Use Headspace, a much better and free sleeping app.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Do NOT Agree to the 'trial version'. Its extremely difficult to cancel the subscription, jumping through several hoops just to cancel a lame app that you can find elsewhere for free. I was charged $59.99 for a yearly subscription when I tried several times to cancel BEFORE the trial ended. Good luck finding a phone # to call customer service & speak to actual human being to help solve this issue. $60 bucks for a years worth of anxiety knowing I got ripped off. Yeah, that'll calm me down. SCAM!!!",1.0
sasha pierce,Functional,It keeps crashing. Even when I uninstalled and reinstalled it. It crashed. I turned off my phone and turned it on and it still crashes. I have to force close the app because it freezes my entire phone. When it worked I like It. They have majority of everything pay to play. But I suppose since there is no ads they have to pay for it some how.,1.0
A Google user,Functional,"I don't want to try the 7 days because you have to put your payment in and get charged $70 if you don't cancel in time and that kind of thing gives me some anxiety, which is the opposite of what this is supposed to do, so i tried the free version and what a rip off... You get almost nothing. At the least i wanted to hear some music or listen to some sounds to see if it helped me sleep better but it's locked behind a subscription. This app is all about money, not calmness.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"One star is a complement. I did the free trial. Decided to cancel the $70 subscription because I didn't use it as much as I thought I would. They tell you it's sooo easy to cancel as long as you do it within that time frame. LIES!!!! Even though the site showed it canceled, they still ran it through my credit card!!! SO PISSED!!!!!! They owe me a refund; doubt I'll ever see it.",1.0
Aislin Kageno,Functional,"I'm sure it's a nice app, but as many have said, it has virtually no free content. Why mark it as ""some in app purchases"" when really it's all or nothing? I kind of thought it was going to give me the option to purchase individual sleep stories. I could only find one free meditation after lots of browsing and I found the voice grating and the content stressful. Also, the app throws you directly into an unintuitive menu with no guidance, which isn't helpful when I came here for anxiety reduction.",1.0
Silas Keiner,Functional,"I've used this app for several years after being impressed with what they offered for free. I paid for a yearly subscription twice. There was no lifetime option back then. Would be nice if they let you pay to own because this app is REALLY expensive. The content is good, but some stuff is repeated after a year, so I stopped paying, only to find out they don't offer ANYTHING except a tutorial for free anymore. You used to be able to do the current daily calm session at least. Lost a longtime user",1.0
Jodi Kendle,Functional,"It's crazy expensive in my opinion. There are good apps that are free to use and access most of the items on the app and gives you an upgrade option for the few that aren't free, like Sleep Sounds for example. This Calm app doesn't have any parts of it that are free to use that I could find at least. I uninstalled it pretty much right away for that reason.",1.0
Heather Myers,Functional,"I don't understand. The description says that much of the app is free, but I can't find any of the free features. I was really looking forward to trying out some of the free content, because I'd planned to subscribe if I liked it, but this bait and switch has made a terrible first impression. My galaxy phone automatically loaded 4 ""stories"" from Calm into my native clock app - I'm guessing these are the only free items in the entire app? Disappointed.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Any app, or service that requires you to give your payment info to use the free trial period, is a complete and total setup in hopes you forget to cancel. Imagine how much money companies make off auto renew subscriptions when the customer isn't paying proper attention to their accounts. These apps are no different. There is absolutely no reason you should have to give your credit card information for a trial period. If someone likes it, they'll come back and pay. Otherwise, shotty.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Not worth it. I get apps have to make money, but almost everything is locked unless you get a premium, even the most basic stuff it seems has a lock, like hearing rain fall or an ocean sound. Mission for this app is just gone. I tried to give it a chance but, it's just a horrible app only after money. Severely disappointed. If I could give it zero stars I would.",1.0
Zachary M,Functional,"Used to be great. Now even things that were free are behind a paywall. I'd be fine with paying, but I need the option to unlock specific sounds. The whole time I had this app, I only ever used the crickets soundscape, so it doesn't make sense for me to be paying for all those other options. For $70 a year, I'll just go record my own crickets when I go back home to the countryside. For $3-5 per sound, however,I'd be down. Devs- maybe something to think about? I'm sure I'm not the only one.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Now, after after just downloading this app, in order to access (unlock) most of the features, I learn that after a 7-day free trial, I have to shell out $70 ($69.99) for a year subscription. Wow!.... it used to be $60. That is quite a lot of money to pay yearly for an app. I am disappointed. But just the thought of paying $70 causes stress... to both me and my wallet. Will be uninstalling. Sorry.",1.0
Nicole Cade,Functional,App worked great at first. Haven't been able to login for several months. I have unstalled the app several times hoping it will work once I install it again. No luck. I have requested a login reset email. I never receive the emails. I can get emails about events but not the reset login ones (the ones that I need). It really sucks because I have a year subscription for nothing.,1.0
A Google user,Functional,"I usually love calm, but lately my experience been bad. I started using the soundscapes with timer about 1 week ago to sleep at night.. It worked for the first couple of days. Now it randomly stops every half hour, despite an eight hour timer set, to give me the ""well done"" message. Not good, not good at all. Please fix it asap or I will need to cancel my subscription.",1.0
April Lillie,Functional,"I couldn't even get past my set up phase because it kept messing up on the causes of my stress. I would click 1 and 2-4 random choices would highlight and it went to the next screen. When I went back to fix it, the same thing kept happening with different random choices and then going to the next screen. Kinda stressful... Thanks.",1.0
Katie Tennison,Functional,"Very disappointed. Signed up for trial and wasn't impressed. Got no warning and suddenly I get an email saying they charged my account $75. Within 1 hour of receiving the email, I tried to cancel, but was refused a refund. This is a total scam and now I have lost $75 which is huge for me, but pocket change to Google. Shame on them. They also told another user that they had monthly payments which is the only reason I did the trial. They certainly DO NOT have this option, so don't believe them.",1.0
R Lew,Functional,Tv commercial said now free. Not from what I'm seeing. $69 for the year and when you back out they try and offer a discount at $49 a year. I'm sorry but this is way too expensive especially on top of all my other subscriptions like music and TV. No such thing as a bad product but price is definitely a issue. Yeah they offer a 7 day free trial but we all know the nightmare behind auto payment that comes along with these free trials. I really think you should honor the tv advertisement.,1.0
Shelley,Functional,"Purchased this app year ago believing I'd be able to cancel at anytime by going in Subscriptions on Google Play. Purchased it, I didn't like it. Went to the place I was instructed to cancel. It most definitely APPEARED TO CANCEL. It did not. Noticed a large withdrawal today for this app which I simply CANNOT AFFORD. Which shouldn't have happened. Now I cannot figure out how to cancel something that has already been cancelled but really isn't. Now I get to decide who gets to eat today? Nice! THX!",1.0
Olivia Liera,Functional,"I used this app on occasion for the ambient music and it worked great. The majority of content was locked by premium, but there were still free parts. Now everything (and I mean everything) is locked. Why is it a free app if nothing is available? It feels a disingenuous to have an app meant to calm people blocked entirely by paywalls. Having everything locked icon is stressful enough, and you'll have to scroll through hundreds. I would look elsewhere for more variety and less blatant paywalls.",1.0
M. Keith,Functional,"Used to love it, until they started piracy. You used to be able (a couple years ago at least) to access some cool soundscape features, some guided meditation, etc, as part of the app. Now almost everything is paid only. I get needing to make money, but maybe if they weren't paying a fortune to hire celebrity voice actors, they could give a product that's reasonably priced. My ears are not that precious, they do not need an A List actor reading me a bedtime story. I miss the old app.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Absurdly overpriced. Plenty of free resources exist that do similar things and this provides no added value apart from a couple things read by famous people. What they advertise as ""bedtime stories for grownups"" are actually just bedtime stories for children packaged slightly differently, which is not what I was looking for. Several of the narrators have a style that many people must life, but I find really annoying (I don't find a really slow, exaggerated ""sleepy time voice"" to be calming). Biggest issue is that they do everything they can to trick you into a paid subscription. I tried to cancel in the app, which you can't do for no apparent reason...tried to cancel through the Play store, but this was not working on my phone... since the free trial window is so short, I ended up wasting $60 on a thing I never wanted in the first place.",1.0
Advanced Roadside,Functional,"App had gone to ðŸ’©! I occasionally use this for when I can't sleep because I work nights I come home very late sometimes after the sun comes up. This app can help drain out the noise of neighbors, traffic and leaf blowers. But I had a wonderful surprised the last two times I used it. Each day I was woken up about 4 hours after I fell asleep at around 6:00 a.m. because of stupid ad notifications coming from this app!!! It's an app to help you sleep and it's literally waking you up now. ðŸ¤¦ðŸ",1.0

I NEED THIS SCAM corrected ASAP!",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Love this app, but, received a coupon for 25% off premium subscription with 3 months free service, It's not stated, but the app offers additional free days, 7 after you sign up for the premium, I'm not sure if that free time is in additions, but it should be, as that is how it's advertised. I followed the link and signed up, after 7 days I was charged the full amount.  The developer did not honor the discount.  Fortunately I used PayPal and will initiate a dispute, if it can't be resolved, I will have to look for another app, or go without. I'm not going to support a dishonest developer. And neither should anyone else.  Response to:""Unfortunately, we're not able to honor discounts on in-app purchases..""  Was not an in-app purchase. It was an email offer from the dev, offered before I activated the free 7 day premium service.  I followed the link while using my desktop email program, followed the directions and ended up getting charged full amount, then told that I didn't follow the directions. Instead of honoring the discount THEY refunded my money and cancel my subscription. Not the response I was expecting considering the intent of their app,  bottom line, they don't care.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"Downloaded this app in a time of extreme stress and heartache to try to find any relief. It caused more stress and anxiety as almost everything but the lake with crickets was locked and started playing things over the top of each other. I had 3 different things playing at once with no idea how to stop any of them, it sounded like I was in a middle eastern bazaar packed with loud people and noises. Will not be using this moving forward.",1.0
David Wingo,Functional,"Updating my review after another year of usage. Content is 5 stars, technical features are 0 stars. Given the high price, I can't recommend this app. Content often freezes, the audio glitches. It randomly stops your current session midway to give you the ""great job"" messaging from the end of your last session. There's no playlist abilities and it's all EXTREMELY difficult to navigate. They need to take some best practices from podcast and audiobook devs and fix the user experience big time.",1.0
A Google user,Functional,"I used to love this app when I first got it years ago, and then I got new phones and forgot about it. I found it again and unfortunately it's a paid subscription type app. Where once you could listen to calming noises and learn about meditation for free, they've decided to monetize their stuff which makes it impossible for the majority of users to access. It's a shame they push a 60$ subscription on you every two seconds. Could have been a great app that helped a lot of people. Oh well.",1.0
David Cruz,Functional,"The only thing free is one breathing exercise. You have to sign up for a 7 day free trial to use the other features. ðŸ‘Ž ""Calm is free to download and use.

A Google user,Functional,"This disgustingly priced ($70) app with limited features spams your screen with various things that you can technically get through without creating an account or paying a thing, but it's such a ridiculous circus of jumping through hoops just to try the free version.

I tried this because my elderly mother wanted to try it, but this is not recommended for the elderly because of the aforementioned issues, though it would be good otherwise.",1.0
Chandler D.,Functional,"Honestly disappointing... I loved this app. It was so calming. The perfect way to settle down. And then, one day, it gets paywalled out of nowhere.

They might as well make people pay for the app! You could literally listen to everything in a day of 2. Overall I am very disappointed, this is a scam. Especially in a time like this.",1.0
Tyler Riggs,Functional,"Used the app since 2016, but the design and curation choices have made me cancel and uninstall. A dozen different routes to get to what you want, but none of them intuitive. Overactive curation that destroys the ability to find anything. Gigantic tiles that manage to reduce the amount of helpful information on the screen while severely cluttering it up. I think I'm good on not having my money go towards random influencers or a design that just copy pastes whatever Spotify has done lately.",1.0

Travis Pendell,Functional,70 dollars a year?.... sleep jar.. it's free and full of sounds to help you focus and sleep.

Shelby Evans,Functional,"I love this app and use it every night, but it has so many bugs. The app won't stop playing the background music even if you completely close the app on your phone.

Nicholas Haley,Functional,"I'd really like to love this app, but for an audio app it has a ton of connection/playback issues!

Debra Nanni,Functional,"I have embraced Calm for over 8 months. I did not subscribe to the premium subscription because it is not within my budget. I only used the app for one sound/song/music. The night stories and other choices looked interesting, it was still this one incredibly beautiful sound that was my go-to. I appreciated the app for it. But now, it is locked. After all of this time. They had to lock it. So I would need to pay the yearly premium just to hear this by Kip Mazuy. This is so disappointing.",2.0
Cecile Ferreboeuf Clayes,Functional,"I have the paid version and will not renew. Pros : beautiful interfaces and contents (images, sounds...etc) Cons: 1-application is way too noisy (even when deactivating notifications). Too much stuff, no hierarchy, it keeps throwing new stuff in your face for you to 'consume', where really, the goal is the opposite. 2-navigating the app is a nightmare. So hard to find what I played yesterday. 3- Open end meditation with bell timers is great idea but VERY impractical to use.",2.0
Emma Piechota,Functional,I got this app when most of the sounds were free. When they updated their app and made almost everything premium I was still able to keep my saved favorited sounds no problem. I recently got a new phone and can no longer use my sounds even though I'm under the same account. It's really disappointing especially since this used to be my favorite app. I can't use it anymore after that.,2.0
Not Telling,Functional,"It's only a good app if you can afford the annual subscription fee, otherwise you only have access to a tiny selection that is well hidden within ""locked"" content. I would give two more stars if there was at least an option to buy sessions you are interested in instead of the subscription. The way it is currently set up, it's an all or nothing situation. With the subscription, it's closer to a five star app. As a ""free"" app, two stars is generous.",2.0
John Lillywhite,Functional,"Frustrating App. Developers should pay more attention to the fundamentals and basic functionality before heading into a huge library of sounds and music and lessons. Backgrounds shut off. Volume is hard to adjust. Perhaps there are ways to fix these things, but I tried and I couldn't figure it out. Just to monolithic for the price of $70/year",2.0
Corey Boyles,Functional,"The app can be buggy - particularly with the background sounds. When choosing a scene, sometimes it won't play after it is chosen unless I close/reopen several times. Also the background sounds stop right after the meditation, even when the setting is set to continue playing on the background. So if I'm trying to stay in that meditation zone, there is a jarring silence immediately after the meditation ends. I do like many aspects of the app but feel my blood pressure rise sometimes using it.",2.0
Melissa Johnson,Functional,"Love the idea, but the hefty up front yearly price makes it unaffordable. I read that there is a free version, but I've only found 2 sleep stories and one meditation. The $70 charged yearly is absurd and acts as a massive gate, preventing access. I'd consider if it were a monthly fee, but all that up front is too much. The content is good, like, *really good*, but it needs to be more accessible",2.0
Whitney,Functional,"I would give this app a higher rating, but for some reason when I set the sleep timer, it will override my volume settings and keep lowering the volume. There is no option to turn this off. If I set the sleep timer for 2 hours, I don't want the volume lowering every two minutes. By the time half an hour goes by I can't even hear the sound. And the lowering audio is jarring, having the opposite effect. Please fix or tell me how to prevent this from happening.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Good, but not enough silence. There are some great things in this app and I want to like it. The problem is they talk waayy too much during the meditations. I know they're supposed to be guiding you, but every time I would start to get my mind still, a voice would jump in and go on a minute long directive. I never finished a session without feel frustrated. I've tried many other meditation apps and this one offers the least amount of silence, which is a priority when learning to meditate.",2.0
Eugeniu Cuznetov,Functional,"This app isn't special in any way. It is just simply good. The price for premium account is way too high and isn't worth it. I would not pay more than 40$ per year or probably 3.99$ a month. I enjoyed a few guided meditations. Not all narrators are good. My favorite one was with LeBron James, but the series was VERY short. The app itself is laggy and lacks perfection, it is hard to find the specific meditation you need.",2.0
Jake Law,Functional,"App takes over your phone. The calm app refuses to close and will continue playing sound in the background. Every time I connect to a Bluetooth device, it begins a story or calming sounds or something. If you force quit, it just opens itself back up a few minutes later. I really wanted to like this but the app is hot garbage and has made the experience more annoying and frustrating than calming",2.0
Ryan Rickert,Functional,"Used to really like using this app for peaceful meditative music. At some point though it started getting glitchy, and it's usefulness as a music app is no good anymore. Even within a curated playlist it will repeat a single track or switch out to a random nature noise. Seems like they've concentrated to much on getting celebrities to make tracks and not enough on making a functional app. Absolutely not worth paying $$$ for, I'm not even going to use it until the end of my free subscription.",2.0
Matthew Downey,Functional,"The app is frustrating (user experience is bad). There's a really long load screen where it says ""take a deep breath"" every time you open the app, and if you ever do a mindfulness session it will have a blocking popup notification about that (e.g. I've gotten the same ""you've completed your 9th session"" notification over 10 times). I mostly use the app to listen to waterfalls or rain while sleeping, and I'm pretty sure there's better and cheaper apps for that.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"The app worked well for about two months. Then it stopped syncing (I had a good signal). I reinstalled, logged off, cleared data ... Couldn't log back in. Couldn't even create a new account. ""Forgot password"" didn't work. Now I question the timing of at least 10 phishing emails that suddenly appeared. So glad I had opted for the free version.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I love this app. As a teacher, I was able to get the full version to use with my classroom. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to use it for the last few weeks. Being a school, the filters are strong, and it says ""outdated or unsafe TLS security settings"". My IT person did add much as he could, but it's on the website to fix it now. Please do! I miss it!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I used to love this app! But now they've intertwined all of the paid stuff with the free stuff, and the free stuff is constantly changing. This app needs a tab for all the meditations that are free, especially if they keep changing. It is too difficult to find the free meditations. I know they want you to pay, but be a little user friendly. Will get 5 stars if this feature is implemented. As of now 2 stars because I lost my calm when Body scan all of a sudden becomes locked when it's been free.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,BUYER BEWARE.... This app seems awesome. I downloaded it for the 7 day trial. After that it charges you $60 for a year. My issue is it was difficult to unsubscribe. Luckily I figured it out days ahead of time. If you don't unsubscribe more than 24 hours in advance they still charge you. Uninstalling doesn't make a difference. It's a shame. It seemed like a good app. I wish I had more time to play with it.,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"love the app, recent glitches. recently sleep stories stop playing shortly after they started and i have to pick up the device and press play again...which doesn't help with sleep. Sometimes the story will play through to the end, but sometimes it continues to pause and i just close the app and move to another app. This is very disappointing becuse this is a fairly pricey subscription and the main feature i use is not working right now.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"It's a nice app and I know it's helped many people based on reviews, but for me the subscription price is ridiculously high; there's a fair amount of free stuff but the music tracks I listened to for helping me sleep (unless I missed something) consisted of only 1 melody and not a running play list of several. Setting the sleep timer and hearing only 1 song repeat itself is monotonous.",2.0
Jeri Hendry,Functional,"So far so good!! I really like that there are so many options! And that you can set a daily reminder or not. If you decide to go with an alarm, you can set it on whatever days you want, repeated weekly or not. You have so many choices and options!! IT'S GREAT!!! Update: Deleting app! Who has the $$$ to pay during this epidemic??? Smh cant do any thing anymore.",2.0
TomboyHeaven 5764,Functional,"Really don't want to pay for the the subscription, you're very limited on what you can access and if anything, if they're trying to reduce stress, this way is obviously not the way to do it since people with high anxiety and depression don't want to look for 5 minutes to see what they can access without paying for the monthly subscription and find help after they're already past wanting it. Great app and all but, wish you didn't have to buy the subscription just for everything.",2.0
Matt Deans,Functional,"Well set up but not what I thought it was. Its nothing more than audio clips (some with soothing music behind them) of people telling you how to breath and relax, deal with anger/stress/etc. Literally just instructional audio clips. I immediately uninstalled it. If it sounds like its for you go for it, but know that there is nothing more to this app.",2.0
Carson Predovich,Functional,"I got 1 year of premium for free from American Express. The concept is cool, and there is some good content on this app. However, it really needs a Google Cast button to allow you to cast sessions to a Chromecast, Google Home, etc. I hate listening our of my phone's tiny speakers, and I find it uncomfortable to wear earbuds to bed. I want to be able to cast the session to my bedroom TV or the Google Home Hub on my nightstand.",2.0
Melanie Weiss-Roper,Functional,Content is not working properly. Have had the premium version for over a year and have not been able to use all the content since beforey renewal. No way to contact Calm directly to get a fix to the issues or to get a refund. Very disappointed especially since I cannot use or listen to some items in my favorites lost any longer. I woulddelete this if it weren't for the fact that I paid for a premium subscription!,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I am already so much ahead of this. Also, like always with this apps, its a click bait, they let you try it for a couple of weeks or lessons, then you have to buy it, to continue, and if you want to buy it they tell you a certain super low price per year, and then when you are ready to do it, it says a super expensive price, and if you want to cancel, they make it very difficult to do it, or u just cant, technical difficulties, or buttons dont work. Most of this apps, are just click baits!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"I've had the app for close to a month and listened to the free music and soundscapes included with the app. When I went to use it today, every single item in the music section was locked out telling me I had to get the premium version. This stinks because I enjoyed the app and it helped me sleep or even find relaxation when work has me stressed out. Now I can't listen to the music anymore. What gives Calm? Why did everything suddenly get locked out?",2.0
Joseph Strausbough,Functional,"This app has some issues. The music constantly skips and does so more frequently over time. My alarms don't sound when I'm using the app, the alarm that wakes me up for work will not go off when the app is playing, it will just skip momentarily at the time of the alarm and deactivate the alarm immediately. This is dissapointing because I was hoping to use Calm to help me sleep on work nights when I have a noisy environment. Alarms should not be cleared automatically by an app like this.",2.0
trey williams,Functional,"App is mostly great, the guided meditations are awesome, they have a great selection of bedtime stories and soundscapes.... but... i have one very annoying issue with this app (aside from there was no option for a monthly sub, only a whole year upfront) is that even when i have force closed the app, everytime i unlock my phone Calm starts playing a soundscape. Ive tried it on my tablet and it does it there as well, everything is updated, been reinstalled, cache and data cleared, etc. Unsubbed.",2.0
Estef,Functional,"A lot of the features (much of the majority unfortunately) I can't use because it's locked.. (I have to ""upgrade"") There are features that are free to use - few of them from what I seen tho so.. It's a bit limiting and I feel kinda obligated or in need to pay and (with minimum wage especially at the moment) it's hard for me to do. A little sad and frustrated when the point of it all is to distress and relax. At the least - to make more options available for a free version - have it balanced out",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Will not renew subscription. Only 1 author and very few different voices. I don't jive with Tamara. She is too repetitive. She will give an intro, give a minute or two of silence, give a little reminder to the task, but then keeps droning and repeating. You think she's done with her reminder - nope, needs to repeat again. I use other apps whose teachers are less intrusive and speak softer. I like the music and sleep stories but not enough to renew.",2.0
K. Hudson,Functional,"Don't pay for this. I was lucky to earn 3 months of the paid version at no cost through another subscription. It ends this week, and I won't renew even at 40% off. You can find meditations and sounds on paid AND free versions of Spotify. The sound quality is higher, and there are options for no ads for brown noise there, even on the free version. This is overpriced for what they offer, and I find the meditations annoying and kids' stories are not appropriate and NOT sorted well.",2.0
Brandon Deaver,Functional,"Ran into a lot of issues when casting to different devices (namely Chromecast with Google TV and Nest Hub Max). Content plays fine on Chromecast initially, but after about 10 minutes, the Chromecast shuts off in the middle of playback. Almost as if it cannot detect media is playing and turns off due to being idle. I've had better luck with the Nest Hub, but the media player eventually ""pauses"" after about 30 mins. While Calm's content is OK, the app just feels shoddy.",2.0
Ethel Evans,Functional,"I can't find non-audio content in this app. What busy, stressed person has more than five minutes at a time to put headphones on and just listen to something? I can't find anything I can read, where I could set it aside and then skim to find my place when I have time again later - and only found a couple interactive things for logging feelings and such. 95% of this app is useless for me. I get a free subscription from work - what a waste",2.0
Just Jess (Heyokasue),Functional,"None of the initial 5 options to choose from are interesting enough for me to want to start using the app...meditation, soundscapes, stories, music or breathing techniques. As a therapist, I do not know why every app like this focuses on the same things when we very well know these limited options do not work w/every individual hence my skeptism, loss of interest per lack of individuality and not being free for clinicians any longer to make an informed decision on whether or not it's relevant.",2.0
Nonya Businesd,Functional,Ok so apparently the devs think I am not so swift or something. So let me explain hopefully they will get it. Not all the content has an option to switch to a different narrator. Just an example drift of with gratitude. A fair amount of the content I want doesn't offer alternative selections for narration. It is not intuitive to change narrators! I know how but some things are unavailable to me since I can't change the voice. Nothing personal everyone has their own tastes. Plz fix,2.0
A Google user,Functional,-I'm Uninstalling- The app would be really good if you didn't have to pay to pay for the whole thing. There is no point in making it a free download if you have to buy it all anyways. Besides that the app looks nice and the sounds are good too. I've only ,2.0
A Google user,Functional,I loved what was available in the free app. But of course all the good stuff is locked behind pay walls. I was very much planning on going to a premium account but I discovered you can only do annual payments of 59.99$. Outrageous. If I could pay monthly I would have far more intrest in using your app long term. But since you offer only annual payments I've uninstalled and wont come back til it happens. Here's hoping I find something with better options at a far better price in the mean time.ðŸ˜,2.0
A Google user,Functional,"This is not a great app for beginners. The app doesn't talk you through the meditations. More often than not there is a 30 second framing about the intention of the session and then just dead air for 4 minutes. I end up checking my phone to see if the app closed on accident. Also, there is just one voice for most of the meditations. If you don't love that voice, that's all you get.",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"overall the free app has very limited selection. the sleep section has ambient noises that are poorly looped. the sound just cuts off and starts over, which isn't conducive to a smooth, restful experience. that's my primary reason for not wanting to unlock the app... the price does not match the sleep sound quality.",2.0

Elle Rae Knowles,Functional,"I used to love this app. I used it for free and used the breathing exercise and mood check-ins every night before bed.

But now, I can't go back to using the unpaid version. I get stuck in a loop of ""Which subscription do you want"" and when I hit the X, it just reloads over and over. Very disappointing!",2.0
A Google user,Functional,"Best app until they made most soundscapes and sleep melodies premium. I loved the app because they offered a good amount of soundscapes compared to other apps even if I wasn't paying premium. No they updated all but one or two are free, not even the half descent ones.

A Google user,Functional,"Self-improvement lessons are fine and good, but after months of use it's becoming apparent those are the only things Calm offers.

J,Functional,"Not worth it. I had the paid version for awhile (2 years) and the daily meditations were nice but not worth the price.

Tiffany Roetken,Functional,"My main gripe about this app is that your can't create playlists so that you can listen to multiple stories, classes, meditations, etc, one after the other. If I'm having trouble sleeping, which is when I use this app, I have to constantly open my phone and X out the ""Still Awake"" screen.

Amy Henkel,Functional,Doesn't work well on my phone or tablet. The soundscapes cut out which is actually very irritating. Little blips of silence. It doesn't happen if I play their songs. I also found the advertising to be misleading. The ads feature hypnotic and nature videos but this is all just sound. Using desktop version improved playback but the menu is missing soundscapes.

cathy,Functional,"2 years okay. 2023 app is slow, glitchy...shows me multiple copies of same sleep story in a lineup..I click on one story and it plays an entirely different one. After update, got worse. its updating my status/playlist all the time...freezing constantly. yesterday night it would not work at all. kept saying I had no internet connection. after 2 hours of trying to play my sleep stories I was anything but calm. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. would not let me log in or change pw. 4 hrs later",2.0
Chris Lace,Functional,"It should be a one off purchase. I think this subscription trend needs to stop. It makes no sense and it's daylight robbery. I wouldn't mind if it was cheap but this is way too much money to be spending on an app every year. I'm sure the team at Calm can lower the price and have money to burn but are choosing not to out of greed which is something you wouldn't expect from a meditation company. Please lower the app by a lot. Most people can't afford this, especially due to inflation.",2.0
Amanda Packer-Hopke,Functional,"I have been enjoying this app and it has a lot of good content but I'm very disappointed in the ""unlimited access passes"" I tried sharing it to a friend and it's only a 30 day pass.

Nik Nadeau,Functional,"The update removed my favorites and when I try to add again, I cannot find them in my collection or my favorites.

Marcella Lewis,Functional,"With the recent update, I'm no longer able to easily find my ""favorites"". Please fix this.

Austin Gastineau,Functional,"Very buggy. Casting to my Google Nest speaker is pretty bad, and as of right now, just completely not working. Before that though, it would play but pause continually which doesn't help with sleep sounds. On top of that, if you were casting and opened up a video or other app with sound, it pauses the audio being cast which is not how it works with any other app. Considering I pay for this, very disappointing.",2.0

The problem? Last night was the 22/23rd). Other bugs include not registering meditations, & play/pause being reversed, among others. The fact is, I'm trying to relax and calm down. These streaks are presumably meant to encourage and motivate, however, they cause stress.",2.0
Tim Hamock,Functional,"The app itself is OK but the connectivity itself to other devices is appalling. It does not have a casting feature to connect to other devices, which is a must this day and age . I had to download a super watered down app on my Sonos controller that is nearly unusable and there is no way to find your favourites from the normal calm app. Cancelled the subscription within 30 minutes when I couldn't cast to anything.",2.0
Lindsay Elia,Functional,App is buggy. Play/pause buttons show the opposite of what is actually happening. Audio starts on its own while I'm clicking through settings. There should be a free section for new users to test out app before paying. There are some free sessions however they are mixed in with the paid sessions which are locked and it is stressful(!) to try to figure out which is which while also looking for sessions I like. Sessions with video buffered while not on wifi. Overall disappointing and not relaxing!,2.0
Jessica B,Functional,"Update: I'm canceling my subscription. I have this app mainly to use as a white noise machine when I sleep, but recently it's been turning off sound after about an hour.

Christine Hull,Functional,"Too political. The bedtime story meant to calm is instead working me up because the narrator keeps saying the word ""they"" and ""them"" instead of ""he"" or ""she.""

Niki Zarris Vagts,Functional,"So why after benefitting from playing the Post Malone Circles song on a loop, can I no longer find that song anywhere in your app?

Patrick â€œThejaâ€,Functional,"I thought this would be a decent app to add to my meditation routine. Currently, I am not impressed with the offered content because it is overly commercialized. The meditations are either too short to induce a meditative state; or the narrators are speaking too much and not leaving enough quiet for the session to be beneficial. So far, I find the soundscape feature to be the highlight, but I hope that with continued use over the coming year, I can find the best way to utilize the app.",3.0
Marissa Brigiotta,Functional,"I like the app's amount of content.

B G,Functional,"I love this and it's improved my mental health over a period of four months but I've been having technical issues with it, the longer it's installed the more unstable it gets. Sometimes the meditation audio stutters hard or it randomly stops playing music or meditation audio even while in app over wifi,then crashing when I try to play it again, there's also losing whatever I was listening to when I pause the audio and being unable to find it due to the history only recording completed sessions",3.0
Erica Schulz,Functional,"Excellent media, strange implementation. The stories, the meditations, the music, etc. are all great. But I agree with the reviewer that the visual arrangement is a little...busy.

I didn't mean for it to keep playing, but I don't see a way to make it stop at the end of a selection...the app needs a sleep timer, maybe?",3.0
Omri Abram,Functional,I've been using the app with a yearly subscription for a couple months now. I generally like it but there are a few things that make me doubt I'll resubscibe if they aren't addressed: 1. I'd like to have many more lightly guided meditations longer than 10 minutes. A bit less talking! 2. I appreciate the use of soundscapes as background. But there are often audible and distracting clips when they loop on themselves. 3. The UI is quite poor and disorienting.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Frustrating. While this app does a great job guiding through meditation, the user interface needs help. It's difficult to find settings and it doesn't behave nicely. For example, if you turn off the screen to preserve battery, the instruction stops. You might eventually find a setting under Scenes to keep playing after leaving the app (should be under Settings instead). I set it to 30 minutes, but then couldn't get the app to shut up after I was done using it, even after force terminating.",3.0
Stassja,Functional,"I would love to give this app a 5 stars. I actually can't sleep without it. The stories and meditation sounds are amazing. My main frustration is that I pay monthly for this service, and I can't repeat sleep stories. Sometimes, it takes me a while to fall asleep, and if the story ends before I do sleep, I have to lean over and restart. That's inconvenient and not fair. I should be able to repeat the story or create a playlist with my favorite ones with a timer to listen continuously. Please fix!",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Calm is a great concept, but know in advance there's some major limitations. For instance, sometimes it takes me a while to fall asleep. The Sleep Stories are wonderful, but when a story ends, there's no transition to another story. Without a continuous playlist or a timer, I have to pick up my device at the end of each story, get blinded by the light, and activate another story. Understandably, the light and the movement wake me up again. I wrote the company, and their response was a template thanking me for my ""thoughtful feedback."" The two longest stories are 45 minutes in length, but most run about 30-ish minutes, with others lasting 20, 19, 15, or even a mere 12 minutes. Those people who can consistently fall asleep in 12 minutes probably wouldn't need this feature. But what about the rest of us?  If this app had a playlist or a timer feature for Sleep Stories, I'd surely give it 5 stars!",3.0
Colbrook â€œMetabrookâ€,Functional,"I like using calm. The combination of daily philosophy and nature sounds is really helpful for me. I'm giving 3 stars because I think there is a major problem with how the app is organized. one of the goals of the app is to help with feeling overwhelmed,but the presentation is extremely overwhelming. Even when using the favorite feature to save good meditations, the page they are on is hard to get to and cluttered. You can't even organize it. I would give a 5 star if the app was organized better",3.0
Sue D,Functional,Like the app but it wakes me up 5 hours later. I'll set the timer with a sound or music to go to sleep by. Then 5 hours later the app wakes up again with the default sound of crickets! They're loud enough that it wakes me up. It kind of defeats the point of the app when it wakes you up again doesn't it? I've contacted technical support but they never got back to me. I have the paid version but I won't renew unless they fix this. I'm afraid to even use it anymore.,3.0
Gregory Dash,Functional,"I like the segments themselves, but the technical quality is disappointing. The sessions do not transmit smoothly, and have lots of voids where there is no sound (for example the background sound drops out for a second then come back). This hinders the segments from having the desired effect of calming you, and instead makes it distracting. The developers of the app need to improve this.",3.0
TJ HA,Functional,"Hack to get free sounds. As soon as you open the app, click the ""x"" on the top left of the screen until you hit the homepage. Then click the mountains at the top left. You can choose white-noise music and images for free, without signing up or giving any information. You can set the volume and the play time up to 12 hours. 3 stars because they try to make you pay 70 dollars for the app, and then when you click out of it, they try and offer a 40 dollar deal instead.. total rip off.",3.0
Jorge Bartose,Functional,"I love the content and intentions of this app. However, when using the daily check-in tools to document daily thoughts, it's extremely difficult for me to read white print on a bright pink background and there are no settings options to adjust the brightness or disable the bright colored backgrounds.

A Google user,Functional,"It works, but glitchy. It does help me fall asleep faster. I use the Rain/ Nature sounds. However, when I first started using the app, the sound would play on a loop, which I like, now sometimes it loops or shuts off after about 5 min or so. I've set up timers hoping it would play the length of the timer, but it still stops. Bring a continuous play option. I use this to fall asleep, it's hard when I have to keep hitting play when it stops. Idk what why it just stops randomly.",3.0
Heather Legge,Functional,"Downgraded from 5* Use it almost daily for a few years! Just renewed the annual paid plan. Love the new additions too. BUT recent update caused glitches. When I start a meditation session, it no longer displays my chosen scene, plus it seems like the app interrupts itself somehow, causing audio to pause. Also the music playback seems flawed. When I tap pause it doesn't always stop playing, and even when I tap stop the music stops but I can't exit out of it without killing the app.",3.0

Bethany Rushing,Functional,"I love basically everything about this app - except that it runs at a snail's pace.

Amazing app and I won't delete it...but I would definitely use and enjoy it more if there was an update that made things run more smoothly.",3.0
michael hobson,Functional,"I used this somewhat pretty much exclusively for sleep stories, but I've mostly moved on. The app needs features one would expect such as playlists, looping, and most of all for sleep stories, playback speed control.

These are not difficult features to implement and not having them is pretty much a hard stop for me.",3.0
Ernie Farias,Functional,"App has good content, but it performs poorly. If you leave playing in the background, you sometimes can't pause it using the notification controls. If you don't leave it running in the background, sometimes it'll start playing on its own anyway, and silently drain your battery. I will unfortunately have to uninstall to avoid the unexpected battery drains.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,I wish that this app was not so expensive I would definitely purchase it. The free trial is very limited which does not allow you to get a true feeling for the app. I have looked for discount coupons that would help on me possibly purchasing this product. Perhaps a slightly moderate price for less features would help. I am interested in the sleep stories or a package that can be used on several devices within a family.,3.0
Tami Manor,Functional,"The new app setup is awful. The ability to search on various people was perfect and allowed a quick search versus going by story.

Corinne Myers,Functional,"Not all Sleep Stories are created equal. Some are perfectly dreamy, but, sometimes, the reading is less than professional or the vocabulary is narrow. Calm's idea of A-list artists differs from mine, but, discovering new voices can be good. I've only just seen the rating feature, but, as the goal is to be asleep by the end of the session, it will probably go unused. If there is a timer, I haven't found it. I fell asleep to train sounds and was awakened by same, several times in the night. (Ø¨_Ø¨)",3.0
Karisma Garcia,Functional,"This app is great for calming anxienty and relieving stress. However, there is a reason for giving only three stars. I can't really have an experience.

It is hard listening to the same things. I want to have more of an experience. Thank you and god bless.",3.0
Ariel George,Functional,"I really think this app is too expensive. I mostly use it for sleep stories lately but have used the meditation in the past and while I think it's a great tool, there really should be more features included when it's so GD expensive. One main frustration I have is that you can't make a playlist for sleep stories. I can try to find the longest story but it will still quit before the story is done most of the time. Please add this feature, I think it's a pretty simple ask when I'm paying $70.",3.0
Betty G,Functional,"I like using this app except for one thing - the ambient sounds in the background. They are awesome until the track ends and it restarts in the middle of meditation. It brings me out of my practice often. But I really love having those sounds.

I feel like you would want to cast those more than anything else on the app.",3.0
Rebecca Rowland,Functional,"It's a good app, but it's marketed as a free app with in-app purchases. While that is a fact, almost nothing is free. All of the guided content is for premium users at a pretty high yearly rate. People who are stressed are often broke, too, and even if we know what to do during meditation, sometimes we need to be reminded so we're not just sitting there breathing and getting distracted by our problems. The ""breathe"" exercise is great, but my Fitbit has a similar exercise that works just as well.",3.0
Joanna Belle Photography,Functional,"I love the options on this app from the soundscapes to the meditations.

Gabe Castro,Functional,it has great potential but leaves many behind a pay wall. I do not believe in the monetization of mental health or in those who try to say that it is their primary focus yet make you pull out your credit card.

It would also be nice if you could layer over sounds that you want and at what soundblevel like what Slumber app does on iTunes. That seems more ingenious.

The ""play music outside app"" options are useless and poorly designed. At the very least, allow the sounds to gently fade instead of the sudden, abrupt shut down. This is a good app, but the sound timer options can really ruin a nice meditation.",3.0
Jessica Tangeman,Functional,"Has a great selection of material however there is SO much going on that it's really difficult to navigate through the app to find something.

A Google user,Functional,I'm not sure why this app gets better reviews than headspace. Now I realize how good I had it with that app. This one has annoying default settings like obnoxious background music. The app is sloppy and difficult to navigate. The programs aren't way to understand what their propose is and you can't search for something specific so I can't even tell what my options are. Overall feels cheap and basic,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Helps me sleep a great deal. It runs much quieter during the day though which bothers me. Yes I'm aware there is generally less noise at night to contrast the sound. But the difference is significant. Max volume won't block out almost any background sounds at all. Like traffic sounds, which on my street is busy both during the day and at night. Is the dimming of sound depending on time of day a thing with this app?",3.0
A Google user,Functional,I was just looking for an app with sleep sounds and came across this one. Found a few free ones that I enjoy playing when going to bed. I'd like to check out the meditation and anxiety stuff but I'm not sure I want to drop $60/year on it. Otherwise it's a nice app. Easy to use and you can download some of the sleep sounds to use offline too.,3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Okay so...the contents of the app are great. I've found it very useful for me in managing anxiety in these crazy Covid-19 times. But...the organization, lack of search, and ineffective favoriting method are beginning to make me look elsewhere. Around a month ago I had emailed help or support with some suggestions but they were ""taken under consideration"", which we all know what that means. Please fix this. Tamara's amazing, but not THAT amazing.",3.0
Addison M,Functional,"I'm gonna have to give you 3 stars for that latest update.

JenÃ©e Leigh,Functional,"Music stops in app after one song, all permissions are enabled, and the app is still open. It just stops after one song and this is disappointing.

Desirae D,Functional,"I love this app, except when it continues after the selected meditation/story/song when I'm using it to fall asleep.

During the day, I love this app, but I paid for it to help me sleep.",3.0
Diane Martin,Functional,"I was really learning a lot about reducing anxiety but the app absolutely stopped working. I logged out and tried to log back in.

Can't find again where to call for help.",3.0
Lindsay Inger,Functional,"Do Not Disturb won't allow the app to play content. I have an Android Pixel 4a. If you turn on do not disturb you can't play any content. The entire point of a calm app is to stop dealing with the notifications for a few minutes and listen to a meditation. It used to work fine. Please make it so we can use do not disturb and still play content. I even went into app settings to allow audio notifications from calm, but that didn't fix the problem.",3.0
Kimberly Brodtmann,Functional,"Support was pretty unhelpful. They're running a free year of service for people who have Amex, even if you currently have a subscription with them.

They told me exactly what I was caught on and closed the ticket. Thanks at least for making sure I don't subscribe again?? My therapist has been urging me to switch to Breethe anyway.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"The crickets background music that plays while you browse totally killed this app for me. It was so annoying and anxiety inducing and I couldn't find a way to turn it off.

Shannon B,Functional,"Good content, not always good delivery. With daily and nightly use it's easy to run out of fresh content. They have some very good people delivering content and some not so good per my preferences. When delivering meditation content the quality of one's voice is very important in my opinion, some voices tend to be a distraction rather than an enhancement.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"I think the app is really very good. Actually, it's very very good. My concerns are what I learned from others who have subscribed. There is a security issue with the credit cards and after the year has expired you automatically charge another year to their credit cards and so that kind of puts me on alert it makes me a bit apprehensive and actually that's really the reason that I have not subscribed because I love the app I absolutely love it! it was referred to me two years ago and I loved it.",3.0
Andrew Williams,Functional,"Good app but it's frustrating that some of the recordings have only one voice. One of the guides has a sugary sweet voice which comes off as fake to me or even a little nutty (just my subjective opinion). I need someone who talks without so much artifice. The person I like isn't available on some of the recordings :( But I do love the app, just want to make this one gripe heard.",3.0
Thelisha Thomas,Functional,I love the train stories and soundscapes. I've been finished with my 100th session since... months ago. It keeps congratulating me on finishing it. The app gets stuck in soundscapes. Sometimes the stop button shows and sometimes it doesn't. I have to jump through hoops to get that working right. Forgive me but Tamara Levitt's voice is absolutely annoying. It's nothing calm about it for meditation. I don't listen to daily calm or anything involving her. I tried.,3.0
A. P.,Functional,"Calm really has great ambience, and it helps me relax. Though it has one drawback. I wish the music, sounds, and the rest of the exercises could play outside the app, instead of stopping. Its a big inconvenience, but other than that I enjoy the app to an extent.",3.0
A Google user,Functional,Canceled it before the trial period Because I just couldn't get into it. Im thinking I'm just not cut out for meditation. That was last month. They just billed me for a year.

I love the bedtime stories, soothing sounds, and other useful sections, & is visually pleasing& calming! JUST needs more variety in the free version!",3.0
A Google user,Functional,"Calm is a great app for the category, but I'm not the type to subscribe to a service like this. theres just so many features I dont really need or want access too. it would be awesome if I could purchase individual meditations or sleep stories for like 99 cents instead of being forced into a 60 dollar yearly recurring fee. or even better if there was just a few more freebies included and rotated monthly in the free section I might understand better why it would be worth the money.",3.0

M Belanger,Functional,"The content is ok. I subscribed to the app for meditation, and I find the topics to be limited .

Ryan Siobhan-Israel,Functional,"I love the sleep music which I primarily downloaded it for. Overall, I do like the app for the different things to do. These days, I mostly use it to keep track of mindful tools. My only gripe is, I wish you'd stop moving the Mindful Tools tab off of or around on my homepage. I don't want to have to go search for it. Maybe you should have an option for us to decide what's on our homepage or not. (Update from 2019 review)",3.0
Paul Johns,Functional,"So I had a hard time finding a series I'd started to continue it, and was VERY frustrated. It's a big UI problem, but I was able to work around it. I had to search for the presenter's name then look at his content. There was actually a list for the series that was good. Even though I found it, it was a pain. But at least I can keep using the app. There really should be a link to it from my home page (since I'd started the series), from my recents page, and from every item in the series.",3.0

Marie Coste,Functional,"I have loved this app for years but the recent redesigns have made things so much harder to find.

Patrick â€œThejaâ€,Functional,"I thought this would be a decent app to add to my meditation routine. Currently, I am not impressed with the offered content because it is overly commercialized.

Brandon Petroski,Non_Functional,"This app used to be amazing, but the intrusive ads seem to actually be breaking the core functionality now. I've had several instances of the app simply not recording steps, because the ads had to load in.

Mark Bolognini,Non_Functional,I love the app and I love the reminders to drink water and especially the notifications telling you the equivalent of what you walked or ran. Such as x amount of miles you walked is the equivalent of going from London to Paris...my one issue would be the GPS. A lot of times it's inaccurate and may add or subtract a half a mile give or take. It's not all the time but it's enough to warrant an improvement,4.0

Sara Chapman,Non_Functional,I'd love this app... if it worked! It's been repeatedly recording activities and heart points and then a day or 2 later the points disappear. The activity is still there. This has been happening for years from what I've seen on troubleshooting boards and still no fix. The benefit of this app is it aggregates data across multiple platforms- it doesn't do anything special on its own. If it's corrupting the data then it's a totally useless app!!,1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"It's a shame that this app gets updated so infrequently and each time Google manages to make it less functional. 1.0 was functional but not pretty. 2.0 was less useful and cartoony in design (some liked that, I did not). Now comes the 3rd major iteration and they managed to make it significantly less useful. It records my daily subway travel as walks. It's unclear if they deleted all my history, but only 1 month of data is visible now. The monthly view shows daily data over the past month - there's no way to see how you're doing this month compared to the last few months or the same month a year ago. The new heart points is useful, but since the data is so horridly wrong, I wouldn't trust it. With apps like Google Inbox going away, it's only a matter of time before Google axes this app too.. I guess I'll jump ship before final call.",1.0

A Google user,Non_Functional,"Summary: THIS THING IS NEARLY USELESS, FIND ANOTHER APP !!!  This review is for the new version of Fit that came out in fall 2018, in conjunction with the big update to WearOS. I tried using it with my Nexus 6P for simple tracking of the distance and time of my running routes. For this most basic use case, it just doesn't work, which is inexcusable. Hence the 1-star review.  2 critical pieces of functionality are ridiculously broken. First, when you're doing the activity (running, in my case) it usually computes your pace wrong. Sometimes it seems to include the time when you had paused the app (so the pace shows as way too slow), other times it seems to badly overestimate the distance (so the pace is way too fast). Second, even when the measurement is paused, it counts any distance that you move during the pause as part of the route. So what is the pause feature for?!?  The old version of Fit had a bad UI that encouraged user mistakes around pausing/restart, but besides that it worked at least for basic time+distance measurement. Now it can't do even that.  Other important things are broken as well, if contacted I'll be happy to explain them to a Google QA engineer.",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I liked the old version. It auto synced with my Walgreens apps. The old version was intuitive. It auto tracked vs. me having to remember to turn it on every time I wanted to record. It wasn't as accurate as needed but this is waayyy off. I'm not getting most of my data because I have the remember to turn it on. My weight isn't automatically received from my scale. There's no place to add notes about the day/exercise, etc. There's no place to track food. In an effort to make this simple, you've made it useless. Removing and looking for something better. Update 2/17/2020: Gave it another try with a different tracker -- FitPro. A much simpler tracker and still GoogleFit can't keep up! To add injury to insult my back up plan -- syncing my phone to my medical plan's app isn't working either. My AARP health plan gives me incentives to count my steps with a tracker or my phone! The app won't sync and I have a GOOGLE phone! What on Earth??? I give up. I really wanted this to work. I believe in tracking my steps and, in spite of a physical disability, I challenge myself to walk 10,000 steps or more every day no matter what. It's very rewarding on days when I'm really struggling to ""beat"" my own record but I have to have reliable data to know I'm doing that! This is discouraging. I really thought, by now, Google would have a better handle on this. I actually thought, they might even have their own device but for them to not be able to get their own phone to sync the app correctly with medical apps and devices that are partnering with Google is shameful! Oh well. I guess I can always try the old abacus and pray I don't fall in a hole while I'm walking with my service dog down the street trying to manipulate little beads on tension rods or (even worse) lose my count and have to start all over again! Hey, don't fault my humor! Blame their ineptitude!",1.0
Leslie P,Non_Functional,"No web access to data. Every ""improvement"" to the app makes it more weird, confusing, and less informative. It's fine as a hub that connects the other apps - because other apps are actually usable for the data. Google needs to make all of this content available on the web, then maybe ""google fit"" could be something other than a data synchronizer. Though...they get and can sell the data, so I guess whether we like the interface or not isn't really important to them.",1.0

Richard Edwards,Non_Functional,"It says it connects to my apps for my watch and scale, but the only thing it tracks is my steps.

I waited a while and submitted feedback but it's been months with no fix and it's unfortunate because I used to like it but it's worthless now so I'm finally uninstalling it.

Mindi,Non_Functional,This app is garbage. Doesn't sync with any of my devices that are connected to it. Only tracks through my phone and I refuse to carry my phone every second - especially when I'm exercising. It appears to be nothing but one more ploy to convince you to let Google track every inch that you move on this planet. Just stick with your fitness device of choice and the matching app. Kick this junk to the curb.,1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Such a trash app! It stopped working on May 26 and has not recorded a single bit of data and since it is connected to the Vitality Today app I have lost out on so many points! I have tried several things tonfix it and nothing works. On top of that the app doesn't sync with a Samsung watch so I always have to have my phone on me to get steps or workouts.,1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"This used to be a great app. The GUI redesign is awful, and the metrics are vague.

I don't know or care about 'heart points'",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Update gave up lots of bits of polish, which is fine. But the first day of the week is forcibly Sunday instead of syncing with Calendar settings like it did before the overhaul, fitness tracking doesn't monitor elevation changes, insufficient customization for activities such as detailed logs for strength training, and plenty of other quirks that leave the app lackluster at the moment. Feedback within the app is completely useless and support doesn't address anything when contacted.",1.0
Christine Cunningham,Non_Functional,"Worked great until recently. No longer synching with my fitness devices regardless of all troubleshooting done. This is a known issue for many and Google has failed to correct it. Kinda pointless without being able to synch. Says it can't display devices. Honestly, don't waste your time till this known issue is actually corrected. *** As for the "" response and suggestion to uninstall and reinstall"" I have done that multiple times as well as disconnect and reconnect all devices. Didn't help",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Not intuitive and does not show metrics that make sense. To see and compare activity from previous day/week/month, you have to hit the circle graph of today's ""goals"". The app will tell you how many miles you've gone, number of steps, and estimated calories burned, BUT ONLY on that day (ie at midnight, you can no longer see this info!). After the day is over, you can only see the ""heart points"" and ""movement-""whatevers you have done, and these two ""measurements"" are the only things you can set goals toward. While the idea behind these is okay, I still want a solid number that makes sense to compare and work toward, and it feels unfair to track the info that most fitness apps would track and then hide it/remove it/withhold it. It's nice, I suppose, to get more points for running than walking, and is a different metric than just steps, but the exact ""how"" this works is kindof a mystery. Literally: 1 point for every 30 steps/minute and ""more"" (two?) for ""more effort"". LOTS OF AIR QUOTES! Lots of made up metrics that may or may not make sense for you. As someone who walks a lot as part of my job and to commute, I just want to compare day to day to track what I've done. It doesn't work for me. If you need a reminder to get up and move, this app has nice notifications and a cute graph that i guess you could motivate yourself to do, knowing a run will get the goal met faster than walking, which might be motivating. It will also attempt to split off your runs/walks and show a quick map. So you can see at a glance how long that walk was in the AM vs PM. Of course, this gets truncated/partially deleted after the day is done. It attempts to split my day up into about a dozen separate ""walks"" and appeared to only save (the longest? The most point-making? Again, who knows!) three after the day was over.",1.0
Cynthia,Non_Functional,This is terrible at measuring the distance of my walk. I do the same path and it gives me a different readout every time. I don't understand how Google maps are incredibly accurate when I'm driving but not when I'm walking. I've read the suggestion to reset the app every day and that's not an acceptable solution. The only saving grace is getting heart points which are mildly motivating.,1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I have an app for my scale that tracks weight, an app that tracks exercise, an app that tracks fasting, and an app that tracks my food. All of them do those specific things very well. However, not all of them can be linked together. The ONLY reason I was using Google Fit was so I could share the weight data amongst all of the apps, which it in theory, says it should be doing. Unfortunately, early October the weight stopped updating. Super frustrating.",2.0
Brandon Martin,Non_Functional,"No website to interact with your data in more granularity, which at 45 yrs old is a pain in the eyes. I don't want to stare at my phone 100% of the time, not when I could look at the data on a full sized screen occasionally. Also, occasional sync issues between my watch and my phone, as in my watch will track my ""heart points"" and steps to be ""x"", but then the phone will report one number correctly but not the other. The data is mostly there and mostly useful, but considering Google's power/ resources, this app is severely under powered. Very difficult to really interact with your data or dig down deeper into it. Which is dismaying. I have used it every day for the last 4-5 months and it gets the job done, but it has a certain simplistic feel to it that just feels amateurish. It's Google for goodness sake! They can do better. Even if it had a paid version so you could do all the fancy stuff to help people train better. It appears this is built for fat housewives and fat old retirees who need to be reminded that a nice leisurely walk isn't what the AHA was talking about when they recommended exercise. If you're somewhat athletically geeky and want to improve your training, this really isn't for you. Perhaps G is saving their advanced programming powers for the full integration of FitBit into their stable. That way they can charge more? Maybe. It WILL do the job...most days...and is certainly better than nothing. But, like many G initiatives, it seems like they didn't have a coherent plan nor enough follow through to provide the value that we all know they have the ability to. Hopefully it gets better one day.",3.0
Spring Shine,Non_Functional,Will be looking for a new app immediately. It used to be great but the forced active advertising ruins the experience. I didn't mind the passive ads.

Rob Urbaniak,Non_Functional,"I've used this app for YEARS, and always thought highly of it.

Dan Hoelzel,Non_Functional,"The app used to be fine, but after the most recent update, it made it terrible. There are now intrusive pop up ads, and ads that take up a large portion of the screen.

With the recent changes to the free version (e.g., full page ads every time I log in an entry) and impending changes (e.g., paywalling barcode scanning), it's unfortunate MFP is alienating it's free users.

I'm giving MFP a low score because of the ""pop up video ads"" that started to show up recently. I would like to track without a video popping up. The ad is already had apps all over the place. If this continues, I will have to stop using MFP. It's ridiculous.",3.0
Ryan Bavetta,Non_Functional,"It really hurts that the Health Connect integration isn't working yet. Please make this work to solve exercise syncing issues. Additionally, tons of ads and way too expensive to subscribe. I used to be able to scan barcodes to add items, and now that's a premium feature for no good reason. Sorting foods by recency doesn't actually do that - it seems like it sorts it by recency of the *first time* you ate that food instead - mistake. The subscription price should be around $3/mo.",3.0
Colin,Non_Functional,"The app is decent. Ads are a little intrusive. I hate that they took away the barcode scanner from the free version and put it behind premium. If the premium (ad-free) version was cheaper than $80/year, I would buy. The price is a little steep for not much in return.",3.0

Yuki Lee,Non_Functional,"WARNING for those who are thinking of using this subscription. It is a scam, they advertise cheap subscription but use fraud-like tactics to get you to upgrade and spend more once you have the app. Example using countdown timer to start your new upgrade which usually costs 2-3 times more than your trial plan.

J Henson,Non_Functional,"App is nothing of what I expected. It was a very frustrating way to start my day. As soon as you open the app you are bombarded with suggestive ads to add something else to your already expensive subscription. You click out of one to be bombarded with another. Aggravating! Also, the walking workout is just a timer that timed you walking. I can do that with my phone for free. My suggestion to anyone thinking of getting this app is not to sign up unless a trial period is offered. Good luck!",2.0
Becca Bongiovi,Non_Functional,"It's okay. It's a decent way to get into pilates I think. But all of the workouts I've done outside of the wall pilates aren't narrated, give no transition time, and are all around lack luster. Some of the other features, such as the fasting timer, don't fully work. Also, the wall pilates can be too easy. They play the same song the whole time, which gets annoying, and the longer ones are really glitchy. I'd give it four stars if it was a free app, or even cheap. It's a painful 40 bucks/month!",2.0

Kirsten V,Non_Functional,I think it's very over priced for what you get. 11.99 for 1st month and then $30.99 per month?? That's more than Netflix!

Nothing about gender, stage of life or any other considerations. The help function did not help at all on all occasions that I asked. The subscription is underhanded and confusing and designed to confuse you into staying on a recurring subscription. I do not recommend this app. Just use MyFitnessPal.",1.0
Kyle Lester,Non_Functional,"Fraudulent company. Despite canceling my ""membership"" months ago, they charged me out of nowhere last week (with NO notice whatsoever, they have my email) for $177.

Jackson House,Non_Functional,"Decided to try this and spent some time answering all the setup questions. Then got to the payment part. 40 odd quid per month. Really??? Turned this down and have been bombarded with emails stating free 7 days trial just for you... Yeah, right. Why not make it more affordable so you don't have to try and claw people in this way? I'm sure the program is good, but for that amount of money it's certainly not for me.",1.0
Nicole Lombardi,Non_Functional,"If you want to pay hundreds of dollars a year to be told to eat grapes instead of raisins, and constantly be fed more and more ""add ons"" that you have to click multiple times to opt out of, then you'll love the app. They will start bombarding you with encouragement to spend more the second you start the trial. If you have even a rudimentary understanding of the principles of eating well, this is a complete waste of time and money.",1.0

Very expensive, I paid over $200 and I'm not getting what I paid for. All I'm able to do is log my food, weight and exercise . There are no videos, no articles to read an no coaches - all these things I was promised but I'm not getting.",1.0
Gianna Cassaro,Non_Functional,"This company is trash.

Ashley Coward,Non_Functional,"I wanted to love this, but all they care about is money. I enjoyed this initially, but there were so many things that fell short.

Lindsey,Non_Functional,"While they did help me to make some lifestyle changes that helped me to lose some weight, they charged me for a subscription renewal 5 months after my initial charge without ever making it clear it was a recurring charge or sending me a renewal notice.

Cameron,Non_Functional,"Terrible experience. The program was ok (though it is just a pricy calorie counter), but felt duped when they immediately charged a large lump sum (several hundred dollars) to prepay for months-long subscription. I was willing to pay, but the upfront charge for many months was not made clear. Despite their claims that they won't, they refunded and offered me a promo code. When I tried to use it, customer service hell, not resolved after a dozen emails back and forth. Will never try again.",1.0
Michael Smith,Non_Functional,"The app has ""dark patterns"" as soon as you sign up--designs which hide what is being offered and what you're paying for. The trial is not free and defaults to costing $10, which is the per-week cost of the program. If you opt to cancel before the trial ends you'll be offered an extended trial and decreased price. But the app fails when I try to delete my account after I cancelled the subscription.",1.0
Chelsey Birch,Non_Functional,"Company is saying they are refunding fraudulent double charges. It has taken weeks to address this issue. Originally, they agreed to the refund of over $500. They then charged my card again for the same amount of over 500. They stated it was a banking error, it was not. After complaining they clearly reversed the new incorrect charges because those were removed. But, still have not given the original refund. I attached multiple banking screenshots to argue with them.",1.0
Kaitlin Johnson,Non_Functional,"I like the app and the lessons, but there are some bugs that are just driving me crazy. For what you pay for this app, it shouldn't be so buggy. There are bugs that are driving me crazy.

I also haven't even been able to talk to my coach. This isn't worth the money",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"It seems like it would be helpful. However the notifications became overwhelming and unmanageable. The so called goal specialists are just automated responses, and do not help with you questions. Additionally, the advertised price showed monthly billing of $49. When my free trial ended and I was charged, two months of the subscription were billed to my account. I can understand that it's my job to cancel before the trial ended and would have accepted that I had to pay for one month. But it's not appropriate to charge me for two when I will not be using the ad, and did not know about the bi-monthly billing. Nothing special about this app, and not as personal as they advertise.",2.0
Kit Welch Potelle,Non_Functional,"The app is not as good as other similar apps. You can't sync your data between phone/computer, so you have to use one OR the other; you can't change your exercise if you enter it in wrong; it crashes constantly; and if you reload it, you have to restart the entire program (I've had to twice in just a month.) Not impressed considering it is an expensive program to join.",2.0
Faedra Bariring,Non_Functional,"The app itself isn't bad. The program is fine. But they make it INCREDIBLY difficult to cancel, you have to pay for 8month or a year subscription since they make it impossible to select a monthly option.

I asked to cancel for over a week before they took the money out, and they still ended up taking it!! Use at your own risk!!!",2.0
Wesley Geddes,Non_Functional,"The content is pretty good. But the app is horrendous. If you ever switch phone, good luck. I've been 2-3 months since switching phones trying to get the app to work properly. The information from Noom to ""fix the issue"" is always the same, and doesn't work.

Rich Smith,Non_Functional,"App used to be great but several issues now with displays on homepage that are totally frustrating and decreased usefulness! Technical support was unhelpful, probably because it is a design issue. If it ain't broken don't fix it! I paid $170 for 10 months and lost 60lbs! Great Fast forward one year and a ton of stress, I regained 15lbs and wanted to rejoin. I was given a price of $115 for 2 months!?

Heidi Ibarra,Non_Functional,"Honestly, it's not that good. I like the concept and wish it was better, but logging food is difficult because no food is ever scannable on there, and it's impossible to search for anything specific. Also, just the setup is not ideal. The layouts are better on other calorie and workout tracking apps I've used, and others offer better for free. The tips are fine, but I have been dieting my whole life, and there really isn't any new info on there. It's just not worth the money right now.",2.0
Ace Estrada,Non_Functional,"I really loved this program, but I've been using the app over a year now and I'm feeling the lack of love for Android users. They simply won't put in the work to give us features the iOS app has had since the beginning. Really simply things like remembering foods you add that are not in their database, or editing and deleting your workouts. I've been paying for a subscription this whole time and frankly find their customer service and app lacking. Canceling my subscription and deleting the app.",2.0
bryan hall,Non_Functional,"Downloaded the app to try it out, it offered a free trial. Go through a lengthy set up where you're forced to pay for the trial. It's a nominal amount of $0.50, $3, $10, or $18. The free trail is BS. I get it, pick the fifty cent option. But I have no trust in a company that can't have an honest trail price upfront.

Lisa Reshad,Non_Functional,"I'd heard so many great things about Noom last year but please be aware: these amazing features have ended. No more coaches... they've been replaced by chatbots and nameless ""guides"" who chat back with you in vague advice 24 hours later.

Beckie Jenek,Non_Functional,"I will probably not stick around beyond the trial, for one simple reason: no monthly payment option. While I do have a small monthly discretionary budget, a $169 lump sum payment exceeds that, at the moment. A monthly subscription option fits within my budget. Bonus to NOOM: I tend to forget some monthly subscriptions, and they continue, indefinitely! While I understand the psychology behind making someone pay in full, it is cost prohibitive, at this time.",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Good program, needs better access options. It's frustrating that the only place I can access a service that's so expensive is via my smartphone.

Don't waste your time or data on this one, guys.",2.0
Amanda,Non_Functional,I used to love this app. I downloaded it over 5 years ago. It offered a lot more free content for a few years and it even had a rain and ocean sound for free which helped me sleep. It got me through a lot back then with the walkthroughs and sounds and for that I am definitely grateful. Now I am extremely discouraged that all the sounds and all but one walkthrough are behind a paywall. I am going to look for a different app as this one wants you to subscribe instead of a one and done payment.,2.0
Heidi Solterman,Non_Functional,"They do have monthly subscriptions (still expensive) but you have to do several things to get there. You're definitely pushed toward an annual subscription with no mention of a monthly option. You will need to seek out other options, they definitely do not make that visible. Not the best app, but not the worst as far as functionality. Two stars for being seemingly devious with the billing. If you believe in your app and it's abilities, don't use lame tactics to get people to commit.",2.0
Tessa,Non_Functional,"Downloaded the app and started the free premium version trial. After trial I would be charged around 59$ per month if I did not cancel.

The stories are perfection, etc etc. But it really sucked that they took the money when they weren't supposed to.",2.0
Lumpy,Non_Functional,"It's a low ""meh"". Don' get me wrong, the soundscapes are high quality. But there was already very little in the free version and since I first got it you've moved even MORE stuff to premium.

I'd gladly pay for PERMANENT ACCESS to an individual item but since its premium or nothing, I've just gotta do without, which means you don't get my money. Dont you want my money? Needs work.",2.0

A Google user,Non_Functional,"I've had this app for a few years now, referred by my therapist at the time.

Over time they've added more features, lessons, stories and narrators but the free version is now so  limited that I can't get anything new out of it.

My only real issue comes from the fee, a $59.99 yearly charge after the first seven days. Now as far as pricing goes, that's only $5 a month, but my hang up and there reason it got three stars instead of five, is that there are no other billing options for say just a month.

Holleywood Kid,Non_Functional,"Great app with a variety of exercises for all areas of your life. Unfortunately, a 7-day free trial isn't long enough to determine if this app is right for you.

Cregory B.,Non_Functional,I just signed up for this app for 7-day trial they took the money up front before the trial was even started I canceled it and couldn't get my money back. Whatever you do don't use this app it is a rip off. They will take your money and not refund it. I can't believe it I use this app a long time ago and it was pretty good but now they're ripping off people for their money. I will never use this app again how can you take the money before the trial ends. canceled and still didn't get my refund,1.0
Oskar Nordstrom,Non_Functional,Apparently resetting the password after getting a new phone causes continuous server errors when you try to log in and there is no way to get back in the app.,1.0
Michael Reid,Non_Functional,Up until 2 weeks ago it was working fine. The app keeps twitching and worst of all when I click add food it won't work. I don't think ill be renewing my subscription this year.,1.0
Jacquelyn Lucas,Non_Functional,"I have attempted to put in a request for a refund through the app, it says a reason for requesting the refund is required but won't let me select anything to put the information in. I simply just want my refund, and the date it is to be charge to 10/6. I was under the impression it was monthly and was sorely mistaken.",1.0
Heidi Zanotti,Non_Functional,"It's not free, not ads only. It's only a 7 day trial then $39 a year. Bad description. Could have been good but 7 days is not long enough to evaluate.",1.0
Jocelyn Navarro,Non_Functional,I'm trying to cancel the subscription and it says I need to cancel through Google play. I cannot find the subscription anywhere any Google play. I should be able to cancel directly lose it's app or website.,1.0
Rob LeCheminant,Non_Functional,"I never once saw anything about the app being a trial. I got a notification that I paid $42 bucks for this. I'm furious. I NEVER agreed to this and of course their refund policy says no refunds. Why? Probably because this happens all the time, I would guess. Nice functionality but be up front about costs and trials. It wasn't clear to me. I won't be coming back to this one, that's for sure.",1.0
Skyfire023,Non_Functional,I would give it 5 stars if it synced with Samsung health. Since it doesn't sync with Samsung it doesn't seem that good for anyone who has a galaxy watch.,1.0
Tiffany Davis,Non_Functional,I've been using this app for years but today it logged me out and won't let me log back in. I keep receiving an error message.,1.0
Shawn Furniss,Non_Functional,"It works alright the first year using it I went from 290 to 190 in a year. However, the ads are insufferably obnoxious and ultimately counterproductive to what they are selling. It also makes the app a chore to use. You get an ad practically everytime you go to the main screen and lately it's been running extremely slowly at unpredictable times but an ad drops right away so I'm inclined to blame that. I would give this app 5 stars for the success that i have had with it, but the ads let it down.",2.0
Aaron Sutton,Non_Functional,"Your app is driving me mad! I know it's free, but it's freezing EVERY single time I scan something. It's so bad I have to keep info open to force close and open every single time I scan. It even freezes up my phone briefly. I'm probably gonna switch to another app very soon. Samsung Galaxy S9, Snapdragon 845. This is still a pretty powerful processor.",2.0
Esuerc Voltimand,Non_Functional,"Intrusive ads that take up the whole screen when you try to put in a meal? I close the app and come back. I don't mind the small ads in-between segments that take up only a fraction of the screen, but since the newest update, the fullscreen ads are too much. I've been using this app since 2018, and it's definitely put a sour taste in my mouth how hard you're pushing for people to pay for the service. No thanks.",2.0
Sean McKenna,Non_Functional,"I used to love this application because of it's fair premium price subscription compared to competitors and it's simple, utilitarian vibe. It honestly helped me lose 70 pounds. But lately it has been crashing on the most important of functions - adding a food. So disappointing that if this isn't fixed, I'm going to have to move to another service. In it's current buggy state, I would not recommend.",2.0
Patricia Barnes,Non_Functional,"Used happily and successfully for many years. Didn't mind the ads until lately, they are now beyond intrusive, they hinder use of the app. Sadly deleted the app and am here shopping for an alternative. Yes, I tried the paid version for a year and did not need the features and can't justify the cost in my budget. Hoping to find an app that plays nice with Samsung.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,I've used this app for years and I really like the usability and interface. It always allowed you to connect your fitness tracker to it to keep track of calories burned. Now all of a sudden you need to have a premium subscription to connect your tracker. Really disappointed and will probably use a different app now that has kept that as a free feature. Shame.,2.0
Preston Bowman,Non_Functional,"I really wanted to love this app. It's beautifully designed, but to get to micronutrients you have to be premium. Ok. But then when you use the barcode scanner and the only data you get is calories, it's a little disconcerting. The database does have a verified filter, which is good, but there are a lot of discrepancies even when you use that. I guess it's back to MyFitnessPal for me.",2.0
Kurtis Davidson,Non_Functional,"I've been using this app an extensive amount of time (6 years) and have found it very useful and easy to log both food and exercises. Recently, pop up ads had been introduced and are extremely intrusive. When adding an item an ad will pop up and only some of the ads are skipable. I completely get that it's in a businesses best interest to monetize but the number of pop ads have made it harder to justify the use of this app. Editing nutrition of an item after scanning it is also broken now.",2.0
Julia Pierce,Non_Functional,"I have used this app for awhile now, it is mediocre at best. The most frustrating thing for me is that if I create an exercise it doesn't stay at the calories I originally input. I know they change because when I create an exercise I input the calories burnt in the title. For some exercises I created awhile back the variance is as high as 10 calories. All together I have noticed subliminal changes that, in my opinion, are done to try and get the user to invest in prime membership.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Not your best choice for counting calories Entering data is easy and intuitive but trying to analyze the data is tedious. Their support articles do a terrible job of explaining how to do something. If you are serious about tracking your macros and understanding which food specifically got you there at the end of the day you'll want a different app.,2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"It looks OK overall, but the foods are usually not listed in grams, which is too annoying. When counting calories, it's easiest to throw the food on a scale and then calculate based on that, rather than trying to figure out tbsp or whatever. Almost every label lists servings in grams, so it should be in the database. Also, the app doesn't seem to let you define a manual calorie target.",2.0
Hope Duncan,Non_Functional,"Had this exact app years ago. it has changed. I will be looking for a different one. It seems like the just try to make it more and more complex and it doesn't need to be that way, and that's just the free version. there's just more piled on with the paid version. I need to simply record my meald for calorie counting, be able to change things to what I want rather someone else finds my goals unreasonable, that's not for you to decide. and then record my weight. The other things aren't needed.",2.0
Grace McCarthy,Non_Functional,"I LOVED this app - I've had it for over 11 years and it helped me stay focused and lose weight for my wedding and after kids. HOWEVER, it is now PUSHING their paid upgrade in your face all over the place. It's when you open the app, all over your logging screen. It's distracting enough that I don't want to use it anymore. Im holding on a bit longer hoping they fix this, but chill out with the upgrade push!",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Good-ish, but has some issues. It says you can adjust calories on the ""daily calorie budget screen"" by using the adjustment field... but that is not possible because there is no adjustment field. No mention that it is only for the premium service... So frustrating. Often gets stuck searching for a food. Some barcode scans can be adjusted which is helpful, but some are juat plain wrong and I cant adjust. Ugh.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I had downloaded this app and loved it! BUT, I changed phones and had to reinstall it and suddenly to track my protein and carbs, I had to upgrade to premium. I kept the app anyways, just to keep track of calories. Didnt use it much, switched to a different one. Out of curiosity one day, I opened it to check if maybe they allowed carb and protein tracking again, and they not only didn't, they had raised the price! No thanks!",2.0
John Cruz,Non_Functional,"Used this app several years ago to track carbs and meals. Bought the upgraded version even. Extremely annoyed to return to it to discover that most of the useful features (configuring meals per day, carb tracking, etc.) that used to be free are now behind an annual subscription, and no way to just go back to the old version where these things were free. Massively overpriced for annual as well. Greedy. I'll be saying ""nope"".",2.0
Seth,Non_Functional,"Very simple to use but, it can get a little tricky at times. I think it would be a much better experience if they added some features such as ... 1) CSV import/export for weight, 2) Sync water consumption with Google Fit (for premium users), 3) Add an app for WearOS smartwatches for quick & easy access, 4) Quick add option so it is faster and more convenient than searching for a specific item.",2.0
Meredith Haldeman,Non_Functional,"I used this program years ago on my computer and really enjoyed it. I reinstalled it today but I can't use it. I'm legally blind and if I have my font sizes turned up on my phone, it cuts text off Lose it or it still keeps much of the text at a default small size. This is just the lastest in a long line of apps with disappointing or non-existent accessibility features.",2.0
Evelyn Garcia,Non_Functional,"I have used the Lose It app for 6 years and liked it a lot; however, they have announced that they are going to discontinue the challenges by the end of 2021 because they're not cost-effective. I use this app not only to log my calorie intake and exercise and lose weight but also used the challenges to motivate myself to eat better and get more exercise. Without the benefits of these challenges, this makes the Lose It app just another calorie counter and not worth the money to upgrade to Premium",2.0
Sara C.,Non_Functional,"I met my goal of losing 22 lbs in a little over five months. I entered everything into the app, and it configured my diet plan perfectly! Update: Been using this app for 5 years. Suddenly, there are tons of ads on the free version. You have to watch a clip after almost every meal you enter. I'd use a different app at this point.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I loved this app. strongly visual and compelling for meal and nutrition tracking for weight loss. i had success! unfortunately it caused my pixel device to malfunction. issues included: No calls in or out, calls would freeze phone, froze and shut down System UI often, inability to play audio or any media, or use the microphone or record audio. i thought it was the phone, but unfortunately it was this app. i would give it more stars but that wasn't my personal experience",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"The app doesn't allow me to search foods through wifi. I have to use my cellular data to use the search and barcode functions. I have contacted customer support asking for a refund since I pay for premium and they said they had to escalate the problem with absolutely no idea when it would be looked into or fixed. So I'm currently paying for an app that doesn't work properly. If I didn't upgrade to premium it wouldn't be an issue, but if I'm paying for an app I expect it to work.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Basically a less useful version of MyFitnessPal I downloaded this because it was ""editors choice."" I wanted to like it because I find MyFitnessPal really judgemental with all it's terrible nutrition goals and its unalterable color coding. Lose It is definitely more neutral so that's a win. Unfortunately the take a picture of food feature doesn't really work. What I want is something using advanced image recognition to calculate the food and portion size. I expected less. I got even less.",2.0
Vanna Krawczyk,Non_Functional,"If all you want to do is log calories and use the food database it's fine. I paid for a year membership for premium and none of the links for refipies or meal plans worked, so it felt like a rip-off. Fitness tracker integration is limited. Additionally, I was unable to delete an outlier data point from 2011 (9 years ago!) so none of my current goals tracked properly. More frustrating than helpful. Would not recommend for anything beyond calorie counting.",2.0
Jeffrey Schunk,Non_Functional,"This was previously a decent app. Updates over the past year have made it almost useless. Bugs introduced recently: App doesn't start the day on today's date, so I have to go back and then forward to begin logging. Calorie counting display for the week no longer works. But the worst is that now every time I enter a food item, the app starts streaming a very loud ad; even with my volume turned off, the ad screams out of my phone's speaker. Annoying at work or at home with others asleep.",2.0
Mandi Kary,Non_Functional,"I haven't been using it very long, but I like the ease of scanning barcodes for my food. I hate that I can't make my own target calorie goal. I also can't sync my Google watch so if I want the app to consider my workouts, I have to manually try and enter it and that's super annoying. Use this app of you want a free app with a label scanner.",2.0
Alphax Anon,Non_Functional,"This is a slick, but slow app that's free crippleware. I love the interface and selection of foods. The calorie counts seem about right. But slowness OMG. On my Moto G6 it takes forever to load, and the main screen freezes for about 20-30 seconds while it gets itself ready, even when switching between apps. The usefulness of the free version is crippled, but there's no realistic preview of what we're missing. In this genre, the $39/year premium fee is not expensive but too laggy to pay for.",2.0
Nicole Copeny,Non_Functional,"It has a good setup, but it calculates calories wrong which is a big deal for a calorie counting app. It took me a minute to figure out why I would come up with different total calories when I would put in macros. The app calculates fats as 4 cal/gram and carbs as 9 cal/gram which is the exact opposite. That's a big mistake, one that really needs to be corrected. I had higher carb meals calculating crazy high calories and high fat meals super low. Hope this helps someone.",2.0
Barbara Ann Miller,Non_Functional,"The LoseIt app used to be great. Up until recently I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. Now I give it only 2 stars. There has been a challenge section on the app where people could sign up for & join weight loss, healthy eating, exercise challenges. These challenges were very motivational. Folks encouraged each other. LoseIt has now decided to discontinue the challenges! So many have voiced their objection to this but LoseIt just does not care. I discontinued my premium membership because of it.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Tracks you and your information just like any other invasive app. Disappointing that you cannot use the barcode scan feature without giving the app full access to your files and media. This hasnt always been the case. Years ago, when I first used Lose It, it didnt require anything but the camera. I understand that you have to get paid, but dang... Just show a commercial based on workout gear or something. You wouldnt even need to collect user data for that.",2.0
Alicia Clark,Non_Functional,"I liked the free version of the app, so I paid the yearly subscription. I like the ease of use and it definitely helps me keep my macros in check. However, the app is constantly crashing! I've uninstall/reinstalled several times. Not to mention, it seems to mess with some of my phone's functions. Not sure if I will continue to use the app or if I'll just cancel my subscription, delete the app, and move on.",2.0
Matt Rottinger,Non_Functional,"After the past 2 updates the recipe logging is borderline unusable as it does not accurately calculate calories per serving because of this. Also, it has started frequently crashing in the background and android is flagging it as a high battery usage app. I loved this to start with as its helped me lose over 50lbs and want to get back to that again.",2.0
Denine Attride,Non_Functional,"Bought this app and premium because its supposed to sync with fitbit. Tracking calories is good. But exercise, calorie burn, and water intake are not syncing from fitbit even with a forced sync. This is not what I expected, if I wanted to do double data entry, I could have kept the one I had. Not worth it, wasted the money on a premium feature thst doesnt exist!",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"It was helpful at first so i bought the $30 full version but it never worked for me after that, wouldn't connect to my Fitbit properly. I had to input stuff manually all the time. And it would crash and i would lose my records idk how it happeneded. Many of the food dont even have enough data, I lost all motivation to use it again. I purchased my subscription last June but i dont think i even used it after July. Waste of money. If you're going to use this, just use the free version.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I installed the app over a year ago. I immediately lost 10 pounds, and another 5 over the first month. I was enthusiastic. I am not fond of the constant pop-up asking me to pay for a premium account. Update:. After using the app for a year and a half, I have uninstall it. The constant pop-ups were annoying, but the last straw was when they made excersize a premium feature. Looking for something new.",2.0
Alice Cash,Non_Functional,"It works is the best I can say. The interface keeps changing every day, fields disappear and new ones appear elsewhere trying to get you to upgrade. I will hit a field thinking it was the same one as yesterday only to get the big old upgrade here screen. Seriously they either didn't hire a UX designer or found the first one that would accept pay in hot pockets and a subscription to Spotify.",2.0
Mo Sipila,Non_Functional,"I started using this app as an iPhone customer 3 years ago, and it was great. I had a premium subscription and used it a lot. But then I switched to Android before the end of the premium period and found that LoseIt premium wasn't anywhere near as useful on droid, and a lot of features were missing. Now I'm being badgered to upgrade to the now-useless premium every single time I try to log a food, and it's so relentless that I'm ready to delete the app and find another one.",2.0
Kevin Brosnahan,Non_Functional,"Been using this app for years with no problems. Then last week, they add really obtrusive and annoying video ads. Literally anything you do, there's an ad.

Scott Berger,Non_Functional,"I love the app but very disappointed in what seems false advertising sale price as $39.99 shows regular and on friends. As I took screen shots of regular price, 25%, and 50% off. The all go to same price point. Other than that I love the app and was going to buy full version until I noticed the sale / non-sale.

J Don,Non_Functional,"OK but dodgy promotion of premium and filled bad calories/macros so you must research outside the app to make sure you get the right ones. I started with a calorie budget of 1,650. It auto adjusts down as your lose weight. When your calories are under 1,500 it warns you that's too low. But you can't manually set it unless you buy premium. I was offered 51% off premium for 3 days. That expired. Then a day later I was offered 50% off. Pressure tactic, 50% off is the normal price, never pay more",2.0
Chris,Non_Functional,Ok but with a few problems. App isn't the easiest to use. I paid for a subscription. Website is terrible. The biggest issue is there's no way to export or share recipes outside of loseit.,2.0

Laslow Greene,Non_Functional,"Love it. Great app with great features! Makes it really easy to keep track of stuff though and the search feature is awesome! The bad: Premium is an annual subscription so I'll never end up buying it. If it was a one time fee I could understand, but any subscription based app, regardless of features, at $20 a year seems a bit greedy.

Mark O'Keefe Jr.,Non_Functional,"Look, I really like this app. Unfortunately ever other thing I look at in it is something telling me how I should upgrade. Please give me the ability to remove the adds. I'm NEVER going to pay for an app annually. If you want to charge to unlock for features that are basically addition, subtraction, and sorting, fine, I'll pay once for that, but please stop accosting me ever time I open your app or add a meal to upgrade. It's really annoying. Other than that it's really a great app.",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Don't pay for the upgrade premium!! It promises extra features, but they disappear when I upgraded. I regret paying the subscription, and just kept the free option. App in general is great, I'm just disappointed that the extra features don't exist. I sent an email 2 days ago and still haven't received a response.",3.0
Staci Liscombe,Non_Functional,I have been using this app for a couple weeks and love it. I wanted to upgrade to premium when they were having a special offer but got an error message each time. I saw in someone else's comments an email address to send my issue to so I sent an email. Havent heard back. Now the promo is over and I can't even upgrade to premium at the regular rate! Wth!? Frustrating to say the least. Never had such a hard time trying to spend moneu,3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Great service. I've been a premium member for two years. My gripe with the app, is the Android app is not as polished as it is on iOS. I really miss themes. And I think on Android the app would look great if it adopted a similar look but with keeping with the material design guidelines. If the app is going to be different between platforms, at least let the Android app embrace the aesthetic of the platform.",3.0
Stephen Brents,Non_Functional,Just started using this tracker app and committed to a year of the premium version. Thought the price was worth it for a year. App feels a little cluttered doesn't have that intuitive feel. Biggest complaint is that it doesn't stnc with my Samsung watch for gathering data. Would definitely increase rating if it would sync with my Samsung watch.,3.0
stacy lalumondier,Non_Functional,This app is easy to use and helps keep me on track. Recently my update added full screen adds with sound that pop up after adding meals. Beyond obnoxious! I prefer the ads on the bottom of the screen or smaller adds between the sections of meals. The full screen ads interfere with me adding items and discourages me from using.,3.0
Kimberly,Non_Functional,"App has declined significantly over the years. Used to be quick to look up items, but now it is so slow and freezes up a lot. Works good though when it does work. The free version is all I use.",3.0
Ray stern,Non_Functional,"The apps usually good, but recently I can't log on, I redownloaded it and decided to log in with my old account and it's not like I forgot the password, but it stays loading or says it's having trouble getting through basically",3.0
JC Caine,Non_Functional,"Customer service is TERRIBLE. I'm guessing they outsource. I've asked a question multiple times and have gotten no answers. I regret paying for this app. Advice to Developers: Hire people with literacy skills who can actually read, comprehend, and answer questions.",3.0
Emily Adkins,Non_Functional,"Good app but it's incredibly frustrating to be constantly bombarded with ads for ""50% off premium"". I'm fine with the free version, but I hate seeing ads so constantly it interferes with actually using the app",3.0
William Bailey,Non_Functional,I use the free version of this app and I understand there must be ads to support the work that goes into this useful app. What I don't like is being served ads (hello Carmax) that run longer than a major motion picture or ads in a foreign language (Facebook in Spanish) that will only close if you shut the app and restart it. It's very annoying for this to happen when you're trying to log your food. It ruins what is an otherwise excellent app.,3.0
Meghann Edwards,Non_Functional,Helpful for counting calories. Had the app a few years ago and recently started using it again but the quality is a lot lower. The ads are way too frequent and don't have a timer--I just have to close and reopen the app after every single entry. It's also harder to add custom recipes. Very clunky and annoying--but free!,3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"This app does everything I want and displays everything in a nice way. My only real issues are the ads and the performance. It's just so slow. Everything stutters and freezes and bounces around so I click on the wrong thing, which makes it take even longer. I'm using the free version so I can't really complain about ads, but full screen video ads after entering a meal are pretty intrusive. It never used to be this bad so I'm removing a star.",3.0
Roger Frankenberry,Non_Functional,"Love this App! Used the premium version about a year or so ago, but has some features i didn't really need. Currently using the free version. It would be nice if there was a lifetime premium available similar to the ad removal. Having a monthly or annual payment is ridiculous.",3.0
Cory Garvin,Non_Functional,"Was good, intrusive ads make it harder to use. They pop up after every meal I add and it makes it so annoying to do my logging. They're also unskippable video ads, a lot of them being the kind with fake or hard to see ""X"" buttons to close.",3.0
Brian Earle,Non_Functional,In the past few months the app has slowed considerably when searching for foods or scanning barcodes. It used to be instant and now can barely do it. Intrusive full page ads are also ridiculous. Other than that the basic version has enough features to do what you need.,3.0
Jessica RI,Non_Functional,Three stars because it doesn't connect to Samsung health. The apps they offer connection are outdated. The program is not expensive and I would consider purchasing it but I need it to connect to Samsung health.,3.0
Zsolt L,Non_Functional,"great App with Lots of Bugs, especially annoying when scanning Barcodes, App keeps hanging and saving data wrong, so you need to start again. This is madness Ã¡t recipes with ingredients... forget free Version, loaded with annoying ads",3.0
Steven Prete,Non_Functional,"My biggest issue is that it doesn't show the total calories for each meal while I'm adding items. I have to back out to see if I've gone over my target, and of course that's when the ad pops up.",3.0
Isaac Hyde,Non_Functional,"I think overall it's a very good app that has plenty of utility and tools, my want and hope however would be being able to connect Samsung health as most of my info is stored there as well as my smart watch. There doesn't seem to be any ability to connect Samsung apps or devices with this app",3.0
Jen M,Non_Functional,"Started using this app at my doctor's request. Like the ability to scan a bar code and having the nutritional information come up. Considered upgrading from Lose it free to the premium, decided against it as it's a yearly subscription rather than a one time payment.",3.0
Graciela Suly,Non_Functional,It was pretty good up until the past month or so. The ads now are insane. Everytime you log a food you get an ad. Everytime you log exercise you get an ad. Everytime you log your weight you get an ad.,3.0
JC Money,Non_Functional,"I like this app better than FitnessPal now only because you can still use the scanning feature. However, I wish I could synch my Galaxy Samsung watch. You'd think that would be a top choice for wearable by now. PLEASE ADD SAMSUNG WATCH!",3.0
Cotton Squab,Non_Functional,"Mostly does what it's meant to, but it resets my calorie limit every week which is annoying. I have to manually change it back to the right one. Also i don't understand why i have to manually click ""done logging""",3.0
Courtney Wagner,Non_Functional,"Here from MFP. Accidentally signed up for the free trial, premium. I thought this was a free app so kind of confused. But going to try the 7 days and see how it goes.",3.0
Lee Scott,Non_Functional,"Works well most times really closer to 3.75 stars. I started using this about 5 months ago. I have the free version. I have lost about 15 lbs. I like that it keeps track of my protein and fiber. My husband decided to start using it, and also has the free version. His does not let him scan the labels of products, it is premium only. Also I usually create a recipe for dinner and would share it with him, but now when I tap share nothing happens. For a free version I deal with the ads.",4.0
emily collins,Non_Functional,"I like the app, it does exactly what I needed which was log my food and track calories. I gave it a 4 because the premium portion you can pay for is not worth the amount they charge. I tried the free with the ads and the premium and I didn't utilize the extra micronutrients tracking because I didn't need all that but someone else might.",4.0
A C,Non_Functional,This app is similar to myfitnesspal but cheaper. I love the scanning option! I like the dashboard as you can see a weekly snapshot and visually makes a difference. The theme is cute too [beach theme]. I would like the app to improve on is 1.) the ability to copy the meal used the previous day. Sometimes this option shows and disappears and wont come back once an item is added on. 2.) Able to have customizable macros. Once you set it wont customize 3.) Not compatible with samsung health/watch,4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"This would be a 5 star app but the recent changes to the interface when logging foods is horrible. It is now really inconvenient and frustrating to use, as it had a really easy slider to scroll through ounces, grams, etc. Very bad update and extremely annoying! Will update to 5 when this is put back. Edit on 11/11/18: it's okay now, changed to 4 stars. It's still uglier and harder to use than it was, but at the very least, they've added the slider back in some capacity, which is nice. I think it does harass you too often about the premium option which is sadly an annual commitment. I'd pay $10 upfront (which isn't an option) for premium, but I'm not paying anything for an annual subscription to an app that makes some unpopular and unwanted changes with no choice to the consumer.",4.0
Jessica Anderson,Non_Functional,"I like this app. Do I love it? No. But it's adequate for starting out on my health journey for now. I use the free version, which allows me to track my exercise, weight, what I eat (calorie count) and also see my daily food intake divided into fat, protein, and carbs. The ""upgrade to unlock"" parts are a little in your face, as well as the frequent ""sales"" for premium, etc. It would be nice to not have the premium features on your dashboard. But overall it's doing what I need.",4.0
T. Greenlee,Non_Functional,"I've been using this app for several years. I have the premium version. For the most part, the app works well. However, I dont like that the Weekly Views on iOS is much better than Android. I dont have the option to see the weeks displayed in a month format (with daily check marks). A very motivating view that Android users do not get-- very disappointing.",4.0
Joe,Non_Functional,"Pretty nice interface BUT a lot of integration like joining fitbit information to LoseIt requires a subscription to their premium service. For $2.50 a month, that's not a bad deal however every time I click on the upgrade option it tells me there was an error on their end, so I can't subscribe even if I wanted to.",4.0
Brian Gillespie,Non_Functional,"New ads are awful, but the one time fee to remove them is ok. Ive used this app on and off for years, so I don't mind a fixed purchase. Its well worth that. I was under the impression I'd have to subscribe to their premium version to get rid of the ads, which meant I was going to go elsewhere. Fortunately that's not the case. I got my app back the way I liked it, and I could show a little support for the folks who keep it running.",4.0
Daniel Womick,Non_Functional,"Great app enabled me to lose a lot of weight by having a large food database. Would love a premium version that isn't subscription based. But that's the way of the world unfortunately, subscriptions for remote start vehicles are becoming common. Would also love to see a button to request a free trial of the premium",4.0
Jen Jen,Non_Functional,UI needs a bit of work to be able to find and adjust things. Took off a star because you can't change the notification sound. It uses the default system notification sound that every other app that doesn't allow customisation of notifications which reduces the effectiveness of them.,4.0
Lonny Bingle,Non_Functional,"I love this app. I am a psychologist and was on Noom and got a bit irritated with their program. Honestly, this app does the important things better. I would have rated it a 5, except it struggles to interface with Google Fit. I wish it would integrate with Samsung Health. For those concerned about the ads, pop the $4 a month; it is well worth it.",4.0
Jamie Telfer,Non_Functional,"Loseit is a great calorie tracking app. It has a very large database of foods, and gives good options to enter your own food such as taking a snapshot of the nutrition label on a product and converting that to an entry. My only beef with LoseIt is the cost. If it were possible to make a one-time payment to unlock premium instead of a continuing subscription, I'd probably do it. Then again, considering it costs $13 CAD to disable ads, the one-time price would probably be set too high anyway.",4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Requires paid Premium plan to connect to Fitbit. A real shame as I've been using it for 6+ months and had great results with weight loss, also, the interface is excellent and easy to use. However on getting a Fitbit to track exercise I discovered it isn't possible to sync without signing up to Premium. I won't pay just to get a feature which myfitnesspal offers for free, and for that reason have unfortunately stopped using and switched.",4.0
Douglas Mecca,Non_Functional,App is good for what it does. The problem is the subscription model is way to expensive. I'm not paying $40 a year for simple app like this. $40 for forever. I'll buy that. You'd make more money. Way more money.,4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I really like Lose it, it has a huge food database and displays macros. The exercise database is also of a good size. However, I would upgrade to premium only if the billing was changed from yearly at nearly $60 to monthly, I would like to be able to test whether it's something I would get sufficient use out of before comitting to an entire year payment. Other than that the free section is sufficient.",4.0
Caleb Howe,Non_Functional,"Edit. Very pleased with how LoseIt handled the situation. Kicked me out and doesn't recognize my current subscription. I've been using this ap for over a year and would give it 5 stars. Today I logged in, was kicked out and when I logged back in the app didn't have my history and wants me to buy a new subscription at $39.99 when I have a renewal in Decmember for $19.99. I've submitted a ticket with Lose it and based on the results will either change this to a 5 star or leave.",5.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Excellent app! Super easy to log and track calories. Wish the 'reviewed for accuracy' foods were a little more accurate, but overall a great database of foods. Bar code/nutrition info scanning takes nearly all the work out of the experience. I have no interest in all the bells and whistles that come with a subscription. I wish there was a way to pay $10 to go ad/nag free instead.",5.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I've had Lose It! for about 3 years. I love the simple interface of this app as well as the goal setting and progress tracking features. I think it integrates many different and useful aspects of a calorie tracker/fitness app very well. Customer service is also very responsive and polite. I have found it to be well worth the subscription for the premium version, but it's great in its free form as well.",5.0
Alexandra Fiorenza,Non_Functional,"Switched to Lose It! after the tracker I used for years became oversaturated with ads and wanted a ridiculous amount of money per year to remove them. Within a day, I had all my recipes and meals copied over. This user interface is SO much better! I love the food icons, that you can log something ""in the future"" and it is grayed out until you click it, and that you can collapse all the items listed under a meal. Already subscribed to premium. Thank you for keeping the price reasonable.",5.0
Carol F,Non_Functional,"I'm just now starting to use this app and so far it's been easy to use. I opted for premium so that I could include intermittent fasting and also all of the other features included with the premium subscription. I understand that I can cancel the premium subscription at anytime however, at $19.99 a year(current cost)which is $1.67 a month, I didn't see why I shouldn't enjoy added benefits.",5.0

I literally paid to lose the option to watch a video and try a challenge. Seems counterintuitive.",1.0
Tyler Pool,Non_Functional,"A LOT OF THESE REVIEW ARE FAKE! This is a really good app... Besides for the fact that a little while ago the premium feature was a one time payment, which I paid for but when they updated the app and added the monthly payment they didn't give people who paid before any extras, in fact there are still ads for me.

You want a refund and itâ€™s been more than 48 hours since you made the purchase.

Nice thing is that I can regularly edit this to keep it current! Your response was unhelpful. I paid to remove ads in February 2019. I recently reinstalled the app and cannot restore my purchase. It has changed to a subscription app. I have clarified as well as I am able to.,1.0
Ahmed Yamani,Non_Functional,"They kept continuously shoving an ad to upgrade to the Annual Premium membership down my throat (on my iPhone).

Jerry Zyskowski,Non_Functional,Do not buy this app. I tried to cancel the subscription same day they charged me. Customer service is terrible.

There is an option to remove ads by paying a fee so i did...only to find out that now i can no longer start the exceraises at all unless i pay for ""prenium"". :) Basically i paid for the excersises to lock and have the privilage to unlock them with another subscription. Such a bad practice ahould not be allowed in the store",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Calendar is not correct. It is logging my workouts for the wrong days. Too many ads and the only way to remove ads is to pay $9.99 a month... Every other app you can just make one payment to remove ads. Seems as though this developer is greedy. And yes you do get other things for the monthly sub, but why not make ads a separate one time purchase? Would make 5 stars if calendar was fixed and ads were a one time purchase to get rid of.",1.0
Sophos van Alles,Non_Functional,"Can't turn off ads unless I pay more than an Audible subscription every month! What a rip-off. I'd happily pay $15 once (still a huge amount for a phone app), but this is not okay :( I only use the app if I absolutely cannot motivate myself or am too tired to think of my routine, and find myself falling out of fitness. It's otherwise a nice app. I just wish I didn't have to deal with demotivating advertising BS either end of every workout. I can't believe you came back to ask me for a 5-star review after addressing absolutely none of the things that made the app hard to use. You get 1 star now. What a joke.",1.0
Brian Frank,Non_Functional,Forced adds are so invasive it is a complete hindrance to the workout. They are also placed in such a way it is very easy to accidentally install something you don't want. Addendum: At the very least all adds should have the skip add feature as well as no adds should completely take over your screen so you cannot access your controls. The workouts themselves have gotten very good. I would pay for an add free version should it become available.,1.0

Wanted to use this as I can't hit the gym during quarantine. However, I can't handle the ads you have to go through just to start and finish a workout. I'm looking to stay fit, not get sold a timeshare.",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Are you kidding? I've been using this app for past one year. Already purchased it with all payment at once AND now you decided to go with monthly subscription?

What about the people who paid money beforehand to take advantage of all courses and now bound to buy a monthly subscription which too is damn high? Not cool.,1.0
Vinod Verma,Non_Functional,"I am writing this review after using this app from last six months. Pro- 1. Type of exercises are good. 2. Easy to use Cons- 1.

You can't use same premium account on Android and iOS. If you paid in Android, they will ask you money again if you switch on IOS. They even don't reply your emails.",1.0

I spent nearly 40 quid to only have the these workouts taken away after just under 2 months hence the 1 star. so if i can get a refund or the workouts back then you'll get 5 stars",1.0
Sandeep Balakrishnan,Non_Functional,I made the mistake of opting for premium membership on this app. I just wanted to try 7 days free trial. They have charged me already!

A Google user,Non_Functional,ads appear in the worst places. i wanted this to be good so badly but trying to get it set up is really frustrating. dont have ads take up half the screen. im sure the work outs are great but ive tried to start multiple times only to have the ads interfere.,2.0
Gaurav Nema,Non_Functional,Its a good app. Everything else is just ok except for the fact that it syncs my weight to Google fit without asking. And this happens even when I don't use the app. And this is so bad because it will enter my old weight data into my Google account. It doesn't even give me a chance to update that weight. I have to look for an alternative now.,2.0
Nicholas James,Non_Functional,App doesn't give you any free options without watching videos. Plays advertisements on opening. I might actually pay for the app if I could use it without ads behind every screen tap before I actually get to the content.,2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"After updating they started having a ""premium' subscription to their service and they removed some workouts that were originally free with the app. They still have the basic core workouts without equipment but for them to get greedy and hide the previously free additional routines under a subscription service? That does not sit well with me, even after i was so satisfied with their app that i voluntarily paid to removed ads originally?? Honestly really disappointed when app developers get greedy?",2.0
Shubhankar Jain,Non_Functional,App is fine. Even free options are good. I believe though that the calories count it shows is entirely incorrect and is entirely inflated for the amount of exercise.,2.0
Avi Bhargava,Non_Functional,"I accidentally selected the premium version and now have been charged.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"This app is very helpful and has some good exercises. It allows me to unlock once the paid exercises by watching ads. But after I purchased the Ads Removal, the option to unlock once is no longer available, which is very unreasonable and frustrating.",3.0
Alaina Carron,Non_Functional,Not a bad workout but I have to do three of them just to get my heart rate up enough. The workout setup definitely needs fixing. I selected full body and my workout was over 30 pushups only. The ads are annoying but I don't feel they're as intrusive as other apps.,3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Great for workout ideas. Fundamentals are the best. I also like that the users can arrange the exercises to suit their needs and adjust the rest time between sets. The exercises I prefer not to do I simply modify it or replace it. I can tolerate the ads but the one thing I would like to see gone is the trophy and confetti at the end of a workout (they bring no satisfaction). Thanks.,4.0
Wyatt Erickson,Non_Functional,"This is a really slick app and has effectively gotten me back into home workouts. I feel motivated to keep doing it. The scaling is also really slick if thing are too hard or too easy. I haven't looked yet but it would be nice if they had a space to add home workout equipment like dumbbells, bands, etc to add to the workout options. The ads a bit invasive wish I could just pay to remove the ads.",5.0
Jordan Shenefield,Non_Functional,"Ads can be somewhat ill timed. When you select a workout an ad will, at times, pop up before bringing up your selection.

Had I known my ""donation"" was going to be my new yearly cost I wouldn't have ""donated"" that much. Can't help but feel like I'm being swindled and I really don't think I will be renewing!

Emma James,Non_Functional,Can't see. What the app does until you subscribe. I'm looking for an app that I can search or scan products to see if they have milk in them.

A trial of the full app would help immensely!,2.0
Valerie Foster,Non_Functional,"I downloaded this app after my friend raved about how it helped her make better choices when buying products.

Jim M,Non_Functional,OK when it works but it will stop counting for no reason. Sometimes you can pause then restart or reboot and app will start counting again.

Jessica Lundbom,Non_Functional,"Will lose all your data if you switch phones. Fairly accurate step counting but don't rely on it to keep track over time.

Olga Chernysheva,Non_Functional,"Not accurate. I just walked for 40 min and over 2 miles, I checked the distance on Google maps. According to the app, I only walked 24 minutes and 1.5 miles.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"This app didn't even last ONE DAY before uninstalling it. I did some calibration, taking a known number of steps and comparing to what the app counted.

I'm not sure if folks who left those rave reviews actually checked for accuracy, but I can't speak highly of this app.",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Count is off. My Samsung Galaxy watch is more accurate than this app on my phone. I have made it pass level 9 but have had the 100 day combo reset twice.

However: Steps are sometimes not being counted at the beginning of the day, and sometimes in the middle of the day, and I need to actively select ""no restrictions"" and ""auto start"" to fix it.

Mike Koehler,Non_Functional,"I downloaded this app on my old Samsung phone after the OEM pedometer suddenly demanded I create an account. This was a free app that just tracked steps.

Susan Bednar,Non_Functional,"I have tried using the step counter for two days, but based on the amount of time it says I've walked, it is not even close to accurate! Today I worked outside for two solid hours, yet the app thinks I have walked only 28 minutes all day. I have tried setting the sensitivity higher, but it doesn't seem to matter. My phone should have a good sensor. It is a Galaxy S21 5G purchased this year. I have my height and weight entered in the app. It just doesn't seem to know when I'm moving.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"When this app works its very good but unfortunately it is very unreliable. It is so frustrating that after a long walk I check the app and it is stuck on zero!

Keith K.,Non_Functional,Records 2000-3000 steps per hour on low sensitivity when flying. Makes app useless.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"You've been very helpful Ada! Since I installed it, I had a lot of thoughts but ada will clear that up for you.",5.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I was really excited to try this, the charts and the promises of taking pictures would make life SO much easier; however most of it is in the premium, MyFitnessPal offers more free in my opinion and the ads are way less invasive... I'm just going back to them, easier and syncs with all my device stuff, plus records water!",2.0
Ya Boi Link,Non_Functional,"This app is excellent for tracking what you eat daily, especially if you have BED like me. I used to believe ""I wasn't eating much"" throughout the day at 250 lbs and counting 6 years ago. Tracking everything down to the ounce truly helped putting things in perspective! Now at 170 lbs, everything is in line and just habit. But! Now the app is ruined with huge unskippable pop-up ads. I get needing to make money, but really!? I don't want to use another app, but I'm contemplating it.",2.0
JB,Non_Functional,"Amazing app that has helped me lose weight and maintain it, but as of late I noticed ads started getting bigger, more obtrusive. I could ignore them. However, now I'm getting ads after every meal log and it's way too ridiculous to ignore. That will not make me want to pay for your premium services, only to delete the app despite using It for years.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"As all the other reviews say, the new update is not good for selecting quantities easily. It wasn't very good before though, as it didn't have the proper scale. Anyways, the free version is becoming unusable thanks to self promotional ads for premium. I get it, you guys need money, but you're ruining your brand and you're losing the respect of free users. You need to change something, and spamming free users with premium ads is only going to push away users that might one day pay for it.",2.0
Sarah FitzGerald,Non_Functional,"I used this app in college, was free then. I remember it being good. I liked that I didn't have to look up the calories for everything I was eating. After completing the intro quiz, they told me it was $35 a year. That comes $3 a month, which is not that bad. I just dislike that they weren't more upfront about it. I'll just Google how many calories are in a banana for now 🍌 🤷‍♀️",2.0
One B,Non_Functional,Almost everything requires a pro upgraded account now. Used LoseIt for a couple years and stopped in 2016 after an update. Decided to return to try to lose some weight after becoming a Dad. I don't understand why good apps consistently get wrecked by UI changes and unnecessary features that cannot be turned off. Deleted and won't be back again.,2.0
CrazyWeeMonkey,Non_Functional,"While imperfect I've found this app (which has helped me lose like 20pounds so far), be very useful, though the UI is a bit clunky and dated in appearance. (Previous app performance issue was resolved) Edit: they doubled their pricing for the premium plan, I'm cancelling it. I can excuse $20/year but $40/year is quite the leap for an app that feels like a puzzle to use.",2.0
Mo Sipila,Non_Functional,"I started using this app as an iPhone customer 3 years ago, and it was great. I had a premium subscription and used it a lot. But then I switched to Android before the end of the premium period and found that LoseIt premium wasn't anywhere near as useful on droid, and a lot of features were missing. Now I'm being badgered to upgrade to the now-useless premium every single time I try to log a food, and it's so relentless that I'm ready to delete the app and find another one.",2.0
Kevin Brosnahan,Non_Functional,"Been using this app for years with no problems. Then last week, they add really obtrusive and annoying video ads. Literally anything you do, there's an ad. Hopefully they will reconsider this redesign, which is really annoying. I think they made it annoying on purpose to force you to get the paid version.",2.0
Scott Berger,Non_Functional,"I love the app but very disappointed in what seems false advertising sale price as $39.99 shows regular and on friends. As I took screen shots of regular price, 25%, and 50% off. The all go to same price point. Other than that I love the app and was going to buy full version until I noticed the sale / non-sale. Also, if it allowed me to pay monthly it would have been even better.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,I would give this app five stars if it wasn't constantly harassing me to upgrade to premium. The app has a user friendly interface and is an efficient way of food journaling on the go. I love the fact that it can sync with Google Fit and apply my calories burned from my workout to my daily budget. The base form of the app meets my needs but the near constant pop ups urging me to switch to premium are obnoxious. I have no intention of ever getting premium.,2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,I like most of the app. Workouts are great. It's user friendly. My largest complaint is the food database. ITS A MESS!! Too many people putting in incorrect information. I'm finding myself having to look up the nutrition of everything online which is taking away from its convenience. May not renew if this is not fix.,2.0
Kristopher Huff,Non_Functional,"If you think the often unskippable full screen ads are going to get me to buy a subscription you thought wrong. If anything it will make me use a different app. I won't give this app 1 star, it helped me lose over 100 pounds. It's very disappointing to see what was once an incredibly useful app go down such a dark path.",2.0
Jason Mckimpson,Non_Functional,"App is slow and clunky now, didn't used to be. Was supposed to be the replacement for MyFitnessPal but at this point it might be worth it to just pay them instead. Ads after EVERY entry, ridiculous!",2.0
J Don,Non_Functional,"OK but dodgy promotion of premium and filled bad calories/macros so you must research outside the app to make sure you get the right ones. I started with a calorie budget of 1,650. It auto adjusts down as your lose weight. When your calories are under 1,500 it warns you that's too low. But you can't manually set it unless you buy premium. I was offered 51% off premium for 3 days. That expired. Then a day later I was offered 50% off. Pressure tactic, 50% off is the normal price, never pay more",2.0
Anahi Hernandez,Non_Functional,I like the app pretty good however it would be nice to have a setting where I can change the date of what I've logged. So many times I'll log the past days food on the current day and then I have to delete it all and redo it on the prior day. Other than that very user friendly. Also mime often plays music when I try to log stuff sometimes,2.0
Andrew Evans,Non_Functional,Nice app...when it doesn't keep crashing. Constantly taking way too long to add food because it keeps stalling out every ten seconds. Other than that it is a nice app. If you want to spend half an hour adding food then go for it.,2.0
peter mansour,Non_Functional,"This app is absolutely infuriating. While the app itself is fantastic, I don't know who the product manager is who decided it it's best to spend half an hour asking the user questions that may not pertain to them. I don't think I've ever come across a poor decision in software development. I wish I could recommend this to my friends and family because the app itself is great but I wouldn't put them through this pain.",2.0
Laurel McConnell,Non_Functional,It was a good app until they started allowing ads to interrupt everything and force you to watch the ad before you can use the app again. I'm uninstalling it.,2.0
G Skuzx,Non_Functional,"Update: What's up with the annoying background music? Turn it off! it's definitely one of the better apps, however I would like a way to just manually input the maximum and minimum amount of calories that I'm aiming for per day, and then just have a be happy with that number. In other words it will be red if it goes outside of that range. and it would be cool to have the ability to only show dinner for somebody such as myself who's on an intermittent fast for 19 hours per day.",2.0
Chris,Non_Functional,Ok but with a few problems. App isn't the easiest to use. I paid for a subscription. Website is terrible. The biggest issue is there's no way to export or share recipes outside of loseit.,2.0

Whitney Fain,Non_Functional,I really loved this app until a month ago. It suddenly became so unbearably slow. It takes 20-60sec for any search item to load. Regardless of wifi speed or data. I can't handle it anymore. You will be missed. I hope the bugs get sorted out.,2.0

Kristina LV,Non_Functional,"Would not recommend in its current state. Every time the app is opened it displays an annoying 'Buy Premium upgrade' notice. It takes forever for it to find a scanned item in its database. For most of the things I've scanned, I had to input nutritional values myself since they weren't in the database. A lot of the products have wrong nutritional values displayed. Guess who corrects them? Me. And still I am prompted 5+ times a day to buy a premium. This app is a waste of time.",2.0
Keenan True,Non_Functional,"Been a user for a long time and generally the app has been great and helped me lose weight.

Preyator “Preyator”,Non_Functional,"Been using this application for 2 years as a paid subscriber and it seems like the quality keeps degrading. The application is not as quick and snappy as it used to be. For example when tracking water consumption you need to wait about 1 second between clicking each 8oz glass of water icon, before there was no delay. This has been so frustrating I stopped tracking it. Another example when inputting my daily walked miles, they round to where ever the hell they want to. Doubt I'll renew again.",2.0
Grace Martin,Non_Functional,"Great app, if it actually updated the over-time tracking of protein & other metrics on dashboard when meals/recipes/weight edited. If it isn't tracking accurately, it does me no good. Mis-entered my weigh once, though corrected, it still says I gained 83 lbs in 1 day. Not pulling in Google fit data & I cannot delete custom recipes. Fix issues & I would rate it 5+! Plz add: track nutrition (iron/vitamins/minerals/nutrition) vs recommended daily allowance & vs recommended for post bariatric.",2.0
G L,Non_Functional,"This is not an ad-supported or free version, but only a free trial. Users should be told up-front, before bothering to download, before the app does its data gathering, that the 'free' version is only a 7 day trial, after which it will automatically charge $39 a year. No scummier than most apps, but that's a low bar. If you're into being manipulated, the graphics look good, and a lot of thought went into the process of making the user feel comfy about it.",2.0
Coleman Trantham,Non_Functional,It was working fine for a for a couple of weeks and now it locks up constantly especially when I'm trying to read a barcode. I paid for a year and it would be nice for it to work properly. I have even updated it and it still is the same. I have rebooted my phone several times trying to get this to work. It's very disappointing. I thought this would be a great app to replace my fitness pal but it seems not.,2.0
Aleksandar Milenković,Non_Functional,"The app is normally awesome. But what happened after the latest update? Sync between the android app and the website version is completely broken.

Katarina Cavins,Non_Functional,"made a rash decision to download this and subscribed to premium yesterday. They have you fill out a refund request form that requires a refund reason, but doesn't have a way to input one. Calorie counting can be really dangerous, and they don't have any information about how to try to stay safe about it. I really shouldn't have signed up based on the name itself, but it looked like an okay way to track food patterns. It's not worth the rest of the app to me.",2.0
Tim Ellis,Non_Functional,Decent app but very aggressive about harassing you to upgrade to premium. Edit: lowering my rating because the ads are becoming increasingly intrusive.,2.0
Aaron Sutton,Non_Functional,"Your app is driving me mad! I know it's free, but it's freezing EVERY single time I scan something. It's so bad I have to keep info open to force close and open every single time I scan. It even freezes up my phone briefly. I'm probably gonna switch to another app very soon. Samsung Galaxy S9, Snapdragon 845. This is still a pretty powerful processor.",2.0
Esuerc Voltimand,Non_Functional,"Intrusive ads that take up the whole screen when you try to put in a meal? I close the app and come back. I don't mind the small ads in-between segments that take up only a fraction of the screen, but since the newest update, the fullscreen ads are too much. I've been using this app since 2018, and it's definitely put a sour taste in my mouth how hard you're pushing for people to pay for the service. No thanks.",2.0

Mikaylah Cheyenne,Non_Functional,Just a few years ago everything or just about everything on this app was free to use. It sucks you have to pay just to log in your water intake or other very basic things. The free version isn't really worth using when on any other diet app you get so much more free. Hopefully they'll make some changes but until then I'm going elsewhere. Best of luck to everyone out there trying to make healthy changes.,3.0
Isaac Hyde,Non_Functional,"I think overall it's a very good app that has plenty of utility and tools, my want and hope however would be being able to connect Samsung health as most of my info is stored there as well as my smart watch.

Aaron Dickey,Non_Functional,"This app is in decline. I have used it for a decade and am currently on a 422 day streak. The basic function of tracking calories and macronutrition is still useful, but the recent full page ads are frustrating.

I understand that it is the free version and the company needs to make money, but there are plenty of ways to monetize an app without disrupting functionality.",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I really liked this app and it definiatly was fun to track my food and lose some weight. After the recent update Oct 2018, it now comes up with option to enter number for servings or amount of items, instead of being able to scroll through numbers. I hate the new update, i don't want the number pad to come up every time i select a food item, i would rather scroll like it was before. why change something that was just fine like it was. I was thinking of getting the premuim version, but if it is going to be annoying having the keyboard pad come up every time, then forget that.",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Just not what I was looking for. To be fair, I didn't give it enough time, but I found a couple of other apps for tracking keto specifically that impressed me more than this app. One thing in particular about this one was that it has a button or a gold key to unlock premium EVERYWHERE. It was just a little too cluttered with the focus of getting me to subscribe for me to put enough effort into trying the app. Sort of an ""over selling"" situation IMO.",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"This app is fine. I switched to this from MyFitnessPal a few months ago on a friend's suggestion. I loved their ""pattern"" recognition where it would notice I was more or less likely to go over or under calories with certain foods. However, they moved this behind a paywall. They also used to have more statistics and carb goals but then they moved those behind a paywall too. Almost every reason I was using this over MFP has been moved behind a paywall, and while I'd be happy to watch some ads or something to unlock features for the month that's not an option. I'm moving back to MFP because, while I think this is a better app for paid users I am not one. Now the free version is just a tracker with less features than MFP. Good app, stable, great pay features but too hollow as a free tracker.",3.0
Mark Thomason,Non_Functional,"Basic version is about useless. If you want people to try your premium product give them a free trail THEN give them the option to upgrade. That is not what this app does. It gives you the basic version which pretty much only tracks calories and if you want more features you have to pay $40 for a year. Yes, it is a trail but how many people remember to discontinue their free trail after the 7 days is up? Very few. That is the business model here. If you have a product you are proud of, show us.",3.0
Becci Marin,Non_Functional,"This does what I need, which is track my calories, so it's good in that sense. I don't like that you have to toggle ""done"" every night for it to count in your tracking. You forget one night and it takes out your streak and you go back to day one. Also it will say ""after a week you'll get more help"" but that's only if you buy the premium version. There is an option to track your exercise too. That's helpful sometimes.",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,IT's not a bad little app but it constantly bugs you to upgrade to the pay version.  A lot of home cooked items are not in the database.  For many items there are pages and pages of the same thing with a serving size of 1 but no mention of how big that serving size is.  You can edit a recipe but you can only add and remove items you cannot adjust the quantity/size.,3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I had this app two years ago and it seemed easier to do stuff on than now. I can't search for challenges because when I got search it doesn't work, the foods I look up have many different calories for the same food and servings. And it's even more push-y to have me upgrade to premium. I get having ads, but when the ""ads"" are just the app promoting it's paid portion it gets irritating. Also, please fix the search for challenges. I want to do more than just basic logging challenges and can't.",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Used the app years ago & it was great. Seems to have been upgraded and is more complicated to use now. I wish it would allow me to completely delete all my past failures when I reset goals or restart a diet. No one wants to be reminded of a long history of diet failures!! I've switched to the keto diet so I'll just use their specific app.,3.0
Greg Rezos,Non_Functional,"If you set a goal and follow it, you will lose weight! UPDATE: Recently the app has started forcing you to watch adds while you enter your calories. It's very annoying and the only way around it to to subscribe to an ongoing service or pay $10 one time to remove the adds. I have been using the app for a long time so I will pay the $10 dollars to remove the adds. The free version is a terrible mess now with all the adds, so assume you will need to pay $10 if you really want to use it regularly.",3.0
Kino Hsu,Non_Functional,"Great before the photo update. I loved being able to drag my finger across my weight chart and quickly see what my weight was on a certain date. Now it just annoyingly brings up a prompt to add a photo no matter what I tap. Sure, add new features, but not at the expense of old useful ones. Will probably cancel my subscription in January before it renews since the old weight timeline display was one of my favorites across all weight management apps.",3.0
Tanya Love,Non_Functional,Works great... Sometimes. It's a pretty good app it's very colorful I like that aesthetic. It's having a lot of technical issues at the moment. often I am getting stuck on certain pages it's not swapping back and forth from days very cleanly. For example I work second shift so the way I log means I may behind the actual when it's 3 in the morning and I'm logging. Another issue is its if you accidentally log something for breakfast that's lunch you can't just drag that item to the lunch slot.,3.0
Mark O'Keefe Jr.,Non_Functional,"Look, I really like this app. Unfortunately ever other thing I look at in it is something telling me how I should upgrade. Please give me the ability to remove the adds. I'm NEVER going to pay for an app annually. If you want to charge to unlock for features that are basically addition, subtraction, and sorting, fine, I'll pay once for that, but please stop accosting me ever time I open your app or add a meal to upgrade. It's really annoying. Other than that it's really a great app.",3.0
Willy H,Non_Functional,"I wish there was some way to export the data in to excel (.csv) All the foods, times, and calories, carbs, fats, data are locked in the app. More convenient then a note book I guess. 48 days straight day logging and now I would like to examine the data but I can't.

Dave Hargitt,Non_Functional,"This once was a great app. It has a lot of features, but now the free version is getting more and more ad heavy.

Lagniappe,Non_Functional,"The interface on this is horribly convoluted. It's as if Picasso had created each page. Good luck finding what you're looking for it will be buried in a sea of marketing and randomly placed buttons. I finally just gave up on it, uninstalled and went and looked for something else.

Brian Chadwick,Non_Functional,I have used this app for several years. I recently stopped paying for premium. I like the app but it's too glitchy to spend money on it. Too often it stops syncing with Google Fit. Food I enter into My Foods goes away. Sometimes weight gets measured in hours. My exercises are not in the app. I think developers have a right to charge for their product but I don't want to pay for a product that is not dependable.

Justin Dingle,Non_Functional,"Works but recently getting unskippable ads. One such recurring ad will pop up partially in Greek. It will have two options to click one that says ""visit site"" and the other option in Greek and those are the only options so I have to close out of the app and go back in to get around because it's shady. I don't mind some ads but disruptive, shady, and unskippable or not clearly skippable ads are not acceptable and don't make me want to purchase the premium version because it feels like a big scam",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Would give it 5 stars but it is very irritating that literally every time i open it and like every other time i go to the log screen it puts up a full screen advertisement for the pro version and i have large fingers so it can get tiresome closing it. Also that i have to edit about every 3rd item i use the bar code scanner on because it gets the values on it wrong. It is good app though. With its assistance I have successfully lost over 50 lbs in under 6 months. Now just 60 more lbs to go.,3.0
Noah Beck,Non_Functional,"Mediocre in every way. The UI is good and I like the idea of having fasting tracking in the app, however... One of the most important features of any food diary is the ability to manually edit your calorie and macro targets. This app puts those behind a paywall. While the premium is very affordable, I'll just find another app. Also the library of foods isn't that extensive vs competitors. If you're looking for the next serious food tracker after MFP made their app unusable then look elsewhere.",3.0
Christy Hudley,Non_Functional,"Just ok. Upgraded to premium and synced the Fitbit. My main gripe has more to do with the exercise not syncing up immediately and reducing the total caloric intake for the day. While I usually can tell or know how much food and calories are needed on a workout day, waiting until the end of the day to see their calculations is annoying and quite frankly, useless.",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Not a bad app but not the best. What I really need is to see how many macros I actually have left without having to click on them individually. That would be extremely helpful. I see what they did with displaying them when you click in them but I'd love to he able to open my log and see how much more of each that I need to eat. The database has almost everything in it that you can imagine. I am a premium user because on black Friday it was on sale for $20 for a year. Too cheap to pass on. I'll put up with my small gripes but aside from that it's a good app.,3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"The layout and general setup were ok but a lot of the nutritional info was incorrect, even when scanning barcodes. Also a lot of items forced you to log in 'servings' instead of allowing lbs, fl oz, grams, etc. ...So if I'm logging a potato for example, it makes me say how many servings I had... I don't know what a serving of potato is, but I know the weight of the potato I had so it would be a lot easier to just be able to enter that.",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"For years, this app has done a fine job helping me track foods I eat throughout the day... but lately it's been nagging (and I mean NAGGING!) me, sometimes multiple times a day, to upgrade to the premium level. It's to the point that I almost no longer want to use it, and may stop recommending it to others. Ease off the nagging, Lose It!",3.0
Catherine Putz,Non_Functional,Updated: the issue I was having seems to have been fixed by reverting the way recipes are entered. Original review: The app became essentially unusable when it removed the ability to fill in recipes completely with how many and what kind of servings.

Timothy Herman,Non_Functional,"It does what it says but it's not perfect. I understand that they want to make money through subscriptions but why not let me pay for a lifetime license?

That's kind of sketchy",3.0
Dalton Ridgeway,Non_Functional,"It feels like a very good college project. There are crashes that annoy me, such as when I'm trying to upload a photo and the app dies because it's too big. There is unverified food that is ridiculously incorrect and a default ""share my food"" option that is probably to blame. Auto adding food to recipes is hard because I have no idea if they added verified food or not. Let me drag and drop food between meals. Let me add a timestamp to a calorie entry. Perk: it's cheaper than other apps.",3.0
Michael Fardella,Non_Functional,"TL;DR: To lose weight, you need to track more than just calories, and you need to double check the macros on the app. This app is good for the most part, but you NEED to double check anything you didn't log yourself. Because everything on the app is added by normal people, it can be very inaccurate, even if it has the ""Verified Check"". For example, when logging Jersey Mike's subs, even the ""Verified"" sandwiches were sometimes off by almost 100 calories, or by 11g of protein. Just ridiculous.",3.0
Andi Lanell,Non_Functional,"If the barcode scanner still worked I'd give it higher. I loved it when that worked, but now it I have to manually type everything in.

Please fix this issue, because I really did love this app.",3.0
cagethelonewolf,Non_Functional,"It was pretty decent but once you go to far into the app you are no longer able to see or edit past meals, if you realized you made a mistake counting some calories and wish to input the correct data, you will be unable leafing to the 7 week streak to be miss guided.

Mikaylah Cheyenne,Non_Functional,Just a few years ago everything or just about everything on this app was free to use. It sucks you have to pay just to log in your water intake or other very basic things. The free version isn't really worth using when on any other diet app you get so much more free. Hopefully they'll make some changes but until then I'm going elsewhere. Best of luck to everyone out there trying to make healthy changes.,3.0
Cedrick Collomb,Non_Functional,"Good app but really needs few features to be easier and reduce friction: a. Make sure we can filter items that only have a weight unit (I only want to see items that have grams for example at times to scale my calories), b. Allow to enter direct calories numbers instead of scaling to the units. Sometimes I know I am eating 240 calories of chocolate and I don't want to enter 8.237 units of a known chocolate item",3.0
William Bailey,Non_Functional,I use the free version of this app and I understand there must be ads to support the work that goes into this useful app. What I don't like is being served ads (hello Carmax) that run longer than a major motion picture or ads in a foreign language (Facebook in Spanish) that will only close if you shut the app and restart it. It's very annoying for this to happen when you're trying to log your food. It ruins what is an otherwise excellent app.,3.0

Robin James,Non_Functional,Food database is extensive so it's easy to enter meals. Also easy to enter exercise (except walking) but the app defaults to increasing the calories you can consume if you enter exercise. This will lengthen the time needed to lose weight. You can only change that setting each day rather than changing it once for all days. I consider this a major flaw they should address.,3.0

Meghann Edwards,Non_Functional,Helpful for counting calories. Had the app a few years ago and recently started using it again but the quality is a lot lower.

Kellie Hill,Non_Functional,"The functionality is great. I do find the UI to be outdated and not terribly appealing. If it got an aesthetic makeover, I would definitely use it more.

Muninn Featherpaw,Non_Functional,"I like this for calorie tracking, it's nice to have a visual on my intake. It remembers foods I eat and it congratulated me when I hit milestones like losing ten pounds, for example. I don't like how it asks me why I've ""come back"" when I haven't used it in a while. I did use it almost daily, but now I only use it for calorie info and to look at how far I've come on my weight loss plan. Being grilled just because I need to pop in is super annoying.",4.0

A Google user,Non_Functional,Consistency is key. The app has cute little reminders to keep you on track. Honestly writing down what I'm eating on a daily basis has been the key of my weight loss. sometimes just knowing that you will have to add something to your tracker will keep you from eating something that is not healthy for you. I got the premium version for the ability to track in advance because if I am planning on eating a certain thing I can budget for that. I've been eating the calories recommended and have not been hungry. it's up to you and how dedicated you are to your own health but this is a very helpful tool.,4.0
Daniel Womick,Non_Functional,"Great app enabled me to lose a lot of weight by having a large food database. Would love a premium version that isn't subscription based. But that's the way of the world unfortunately, subscriptions for remote start vehicles are becoming common. Would also love to see a button to request a free trial of the premium",4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I love this app! Sometimes I'm not always sure I'm putting in the right portions, but it has really helped me be mindful of what I'm eating and when. I knew I stress ate after work, but this has helped me do less of that and make better choices when I am snacking. I almost wish it wouldn't subtract the exercise calories from your daily alotted calorie intake because I would for sure be losing more weight if it didn't do that. I did lose 4 pounds in my first 3 day of tracking though.🙂",4.0
Rain Aqua,Non_Functional,"Even the free version of this app is very generous with what it allows you to do and track. However, I feel like it is worth warning people that the calculations are going to be inaccurate for a lot of binary and nonbinary trans people, along with many intersex people. It's nice that they include a nonbinary option, but it averages your limit as if you are right between having an estrogen-based endocrine system and a testosterone-based endocrine system. That is going to throw many people off.",4.0
Claire-anne Williams,Non_Functional,"It's a great financial alternative to Noom and WW unless you need more guidelines. It gives me what I need for ME to.lose weight without all of the coaching, etc., which is fine for me at this point. My only criticism is that the calorie suggestions seem to be a little all over the place. Fairly easy to use as well.",4.0
Andrew Beeco,Non_Functional,"It's my preferred health app. So far, it's helped me lose 30 lbs during the winter and is now helping me to gain muscle mass. Though, if you're looking for the protein tracking feature it's in the premium version. It's worth the buy in my opinion.",4.0

Tom Harding,Non_Functional,"Really feature rich and has really helped me with my weight loss journey so far.

Specifically if I scan the barcode and it doesn't get found, only happened a couple times but v annoying as I lose my recipe! Still, I'm considering going pro at some point.",4.0
Clair Cobb,Non_Functional,"Have lost 2st so far, it's made counting calories so much easier. I don't think I could have kept up and got this far otherwise.

Jen Jen,Non_Functional,UI needs a bit of work to be able to find and adjust things. Took off a star because you can't change the notification sound.

Ken Foley,Non_Functional,"Missed opportunity. I understand that the app is primarily for weight loss, yet I'm attempting to use it for weight gain. Undergoing chemo and need to monitor nutrition and increase calorie intake. I wish the ""goal"" would allow for this.

Amber McLean,Non_Functional,"10 years ago I lost 80 lbs in under a year using this app. Back then it allowed me to see nutrients and water intake without paying. This version is still working for me this time around but it is a little disappointing that those features cost money now. 🙁 Still it's a great app, the biggest hurdle I have always had is realising what I'm putting in my body vs what's going out and this app is great for showing you exactly that! The bar code scan is super convenient.",4.0
Eitan Nargassi,Non_Functional,"The app is by far the best app I have encountered, but the only thing I wish would change is that it would also give some recognition for weight-gain and not only weight loss, which seems to be the main audience for the app. The UI is filled with bugs once you try to configure to a plan to gain weight, and it's too bad because this is a legitimate goal for a lot of people. Anyway thanks for a great app and would love to change the rating and buy premium if it would be fixed",4.0
Vahagn Mkrtchyan,Non_Functional,"Please,please stop making me answer 20 questions every time I re-enter the app! I don't stop using it. I still used the browser version so I don't need to answer why I am back. Please make the algorithm undestand this.",4.0
Ben “Benjelum” Maybe,Non_Functional,"FINALLY! A SANE SOLUTION! The library is quite comprehensive and the barcode scanner works terrifically well and on the rare occasion they don't have a food, the app can OCR scan it from the nutrition label which is an incredible feature I've never even heard of. I was optimistic whenever I finished setting this app up, and it showed me what my own goals were, and I said out loud to myself ""wow that's it?"" love love love it! SO worth the $40 a year",5.0
Allison Harris,Non_Functional,"The app is a bit clunky (too many graphics on the screen), there's no Android widget, the way it calculates calories is a bit mysterious, etc... it would be nice to be able to customize the screens more.

I've decided to dump the other app I was using and use this one exclusively.",5.0
Caleb Howe,Non_Functional,"Edit. Very pleased with how LoseIt handled the situation. Kicked me out and doesn't recognize my current subscription.

I've submitted a ticket with Lose it and based on the results will either change this to a 5 star or leave.",5.0
Daniil Kedrinski,Non_Functional,"Edit: issue has been fixed. Nice app, does what I need it to with less fluff compared to the other one. Well it worked alright for over 120(paid) days.

I paid to remove ads, then clicked a challenge that says I have to watch an ad (that I just paid to get rid of) and it won't play. My only option is an annual subscription or exit. I literally paid to lose the option to watch a video and try a challenge. Seems counterintuitive.",1.0
The Legend,Non_Functional,"I used to love this app but somewhere along the way, they started making you have to watch videos just to do a good workout ONCE. After that, you have to pay 40 dollars yearly just to use a workout more than once. I remember being able to use a workout, no matter which one, with no worries of paying and with an ad at the end. I was fine with it. Will not change my review unless they change this app. Severely disappointed.",1.0
Tyler Pool,Non_Functional,"A LOT OF THESE REVIEW ARE FAKE! This is a really good app... Besides for the fact that a little while ago the premium feature was a one time payment, which I paid for but when they updated the app and added the monthly payment they didn't give people who paid before any extras, in fact there are still ads for me. Just irrating that they did that, and just straight up stole money from everyone who paid before. If they ever make it right I'll change my rating.",1.0
Robert K.,Non_Functional,"Disappointing. It asks how many pushups I can do, I select 3-5 (beginner) and then it generates a plan that gives me on day one to do 36 pushups... wth?

Isaac T,Non_Functional,Charged me full price $60.99 even though I selected 7 day free trial and cancelled membership first day of use. I have contacted Google for a refund and this doesn't meet their policy. Also in contact developer agreement under Google's policy. You want a refund and it’s been more than 48 hours since you made the purchase. The developer can help with purchase issues and can process refunds pursuant to its policies and applicable laws​.   So I'm not sure why you can't issue me a refund,1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,What's wrong with this app??? I was perfect before that I paid for the premium membership. Now it freezes for 5 seconds before moving to the next exercise. Sometimes it just crashes in the middle of the workout session and I have to start it again... Edit: the problem disappears when app sounds are muted. Does it mean it tries to download sound files without caching them when it moves to the next exercise?,1.0
Jon Mort,Non_Functional,"1 star for predetory pricing scheme. I got confused on the duration of the trail and i bought a full year by accident (not 1 month). Also, upon trying to unsubscribe i couldn't find that option anywhere in the app, i had to do it from google play.

Jean Ismael,Non_Functional,"Incredibly poor and lacking personalization and more advanced options.

Jerry Zyskowski,Non_Functional,Do not buy this app. I tried to cancel the subscription same day they charged me. Customer service is terrible.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"Calendar is not correct. It is logging my workouts for the wrong days. Too many ads and the only way to remove ads is to pay $9.99 a month... Every other app you can just make one payment to remove ads. Seems as though this developer is greedy.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"Wouldn't recommend this at all, their exercise plans are extremely weird, and to learn a new exercise I have to go into YouTube which is very annoying. Other than that, they riddle a certain day's workouts with push ups at times, and with sit ups at times. Not at all balanced, and because of this I had a nerve pull which left me in pain for a few days. Would recommend Nike Training over this because it also has a no equipment option, it shows the exercise within the app itself, and also has way more balanced workouts. Stay away from this! ;(",1.0

It's otherwise a nice app. I just wish I didn't have to deal with demotivating advertising BS either end of every workout. I can't believe you came back to ask me for a 5-star review after addressing absolutely none of the things that made the app hard to use. You get 1 star now. What a joke.",1.0
Brian Frank,Non_Functional,Forced adds are so invasive it is a complete hindrance to the workout. They are also placed in such a way it is very easy to accidentally install something you don't want.

The workouts themselves have gotten very good. I would pay for an add free version should it become available.,1.0

Louis Lia Thien Hung,Non_Functional,"I tried to write a feedback to developer but then their email collection system is not working, so I had to give a rating here. I hope developer will do away with the ads considering they already get paid by premium workout plans' suscribers. My reason behind that was pop out ads that shows themselves by halting a workout session is an annoying distraction. It is a serious matter for me, because it disrupts workout sessions.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,ads appear in the worst places. i wanted this to be good so badly but trying to get it set up is really frustrating. dont have ads take up half the screen. im sure the work outs are great but ive tried to start multiple times only to have the ads interfere.,2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I've been using the app for a couple of years now and I had really been enjoying it until the most recent update. The developers got greedy and want $40 a year to let us access the very workouts that were once free. This doesn't affect all the workouts, but there are quite a few of these that I can't get to anymore. I'm really disappointed. It just isn't worth it anymore.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"was a fan until I noticed a bug in the calendar, so all dates are screwed up (no reply from support). Can't reset my history, nor erase wrong weight measurements, which sucks when it's syncing with Google fit etc. buggy, missing key features, I recommend you avoid it.",2.0
Ashley Foster,Non_Functional,"This app was great but suddenly started charging for anything on the discover page, I paid to remove adds in April and thought that was the only price I'd have to pay. If I already did it I can still access is but I have to pay for anything I haven't used before. This is seriously disappointing.",2.0
Don Teeter,Non_Functional,"Looks good but I'm not ready for so many notifications, even after I thought I turned them off. What decided me to uninstall was that a notification looked like some sort of pep talk, and that's great, but when I tapped it and the app opened there was no way to read the rest of it. I looked around. Nothing. Gone. Annoyed. Uninstalled.",2.0
Dionte Diamante,Non_Functional,This app bugs the heck out of you with notifications even right after you get done working out. I can understand it trying to push you but it is ridiculously annoying. I set up a schedule and it still decides to bug me every hour on the hour to workout.,2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"It worked well for awhile. Now in multiple of the daily workouts (lower body) the exercises are blank. Guess they're literally suggesting to ""skip leg day."" There also isn't a place within the app to report the issue.",2.0
Gaurav Nema,Non_Functional,Its a good app. Everything else is just ok except for the fact that it syncs my weight to Google fit without asking. And this happens even when I don't use the app. And this is so bad because it will enter my old weight data into my Google account. It doesn't even give me a chance to update that weight. I have to look for an alternative now.,2.0
Holly Burke,Non_Functional,"No way to give feedback, the button in the app is broken. So I'll leave it here. Tailoring your ""motivational"" messages so you give women different notifications about having a ""good figure"" is utterly unnecessary. I'm pretty sure you don't send men those messages. There's so many fitness apps, I don't need one that sends me gender based notifications",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"App is really good and clever but it has one critical flaw: it doesn't save your progress. This issue was already brought up in feedbacks but it seems it's not been fixed yet. Until that's solved, don't this app is a waste of time...",2.0
Tom R,Non_Functional,Was loving the app but they have changed the duration of workouts from 18 to 25 mins to 60 to 72 mins! The shorter sessions were perfect intensity vs time to fit in my day. I don't have an hour +. So annoying,2.0
Nicholas James,Non_Functional,App doesn't give you any free options without watching videos. Plays advertisements on opening. I might actually pay for the app if I could use it without ads behind every screen tap before I actually get to the content.,2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Great app. Pretty intuitive and straight forward. I just had to give it two stars strictly because of the app not having cloud saves for your progress. Make aure you guys do one.,2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"After updating they started having a ""premium' subscription to their service and they removed some workouts that were originally free with the app. They still have the basic core workouts without equipment but for them to get greedy and hide the previously free additional routines under a subscription service? That does not sit well with me, even after i was so satisfied with their app that i voluntarily paid to removed ads originally?? Honestly really disappointed when app developers get greedy?",2.0
Shadab,Non_Functional,"There is irritating sound play during workout from last few days. Pls check & stop this sound i think it's bug in ur app, bcaz sound tips are not working from last few days.",2.0
Shubhankar Jain,Non_Functional,App is fine. Even free options are good. I believe though that the calories count it shows is entirely incorrect and is entirely inflated for the amount of exercise.,2.0
Avi Bhargava,Non_Functional,"I accidentally selected the premium version and now have been charged. Tried to contact the support email within 15 mins of the purchase but no reply from the support team. Pathetic support service, no response.

Abdeali Stationwala,Non_Functional,There is no reply or update from your side.The app has some bug the excercise are repeating two times continuously at same time in leg beginners and some issues are in shoulder and back. needs more features like gradually increase panel like 30 days fitness app in every category like chest arm etc.,2.0
Vlad Andrei,Non_Functional,"The full body workout is a BIG letdown. I get that it focuses more on the upper body, but i want lower body exercises too without having to switch to another workout routine. Plus, having to do 60-80 pushups once every 3 days is exhausting and it's starting to hurt, despide lowering the difficulty every time it's pushup day. Please, developers, make the full body program ACTUALLY a full body program not mostly upper body, it shoud be 50/50.",2.0
Stefano De Mattia,Non_Functional,"Stuff on here looks good, but if I have to watch ads to view certain workouts once before having to pay, then I may as well just find a fitness channel on YouTube and get what I need for free🤷‍♂️",2.0
Nic Even,Non_Functional,Doable and all makes sense after day 1; I'm excited to see how this goes. I would likevto see animations of the actual muscles being worked or stretched for each excersise!,2.0
Ian Proctor,Non_Functional,"This is a great app, been using it for a long time. It's normally a solid 4/5 but please, if you have to force us to watch unstoppable minute long ads, put it at the end of the workout, not the beginning. It's very intrusive to the overall user experience. If you have to have long ads, put the short still image or skippable ads at the beginning. Not the long and obtrusive ones.",2.0
Google Opinion,Non_Functional,"Please make a app for resistance band workout also with all features like in this app. Like different body parts workout with different levels like beginners, intermidiate, advanced, . Also make a app for hand gripper also please. Thank You.",2.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Overall it's great my only complaint is that the ad space is too large and some of the exercises could use better explanations of how to do them. Mainly though I dislike that it only gives you tips occasionally. (Like when to breathe) sometimes it will give the tip halfway through the workout or not at all. Thats not as useful as it could be. Offer the voice tips with every exercise and five us the option to silence them completely. Other than that it's pretty good.,3.0
Tortuga,Non_Functional,"Definitely good in that it is helping me work out more, but between exercises it sometimes stops and gives me the option to start the next exercise, which I like, but for stretches at the end it doesn't do this and I end up scrambling from cobra stretch to chest stretch (or I just ignore the app) as there is no time to get from floor to doorframe. They give 3 levels for each type of exercise (chest, legs, core etc) but no way to modify the level to better taylor it to your needs.",3.0
Jim Leach,Non_Functional,"Solid app with a great range of exercises. Ads don't feel too intrusive and functionality is decent. Syncing to Google fit is a bit finicky (once you complete a workout you have to go back a few steps for it to sync, it doesn't happen right away), and the calorie burn estimate is way too high (although that might be a Google Fit issue, rather than this app).",3.0
Justyna Resztak,Non_Functional,"The reason I downloaded this app is because it's on the list of apps that sync to Google fit. However, after having used it twice, I can see that it doesn't sync workouts to Google fit, so it's useless to me. The workouts themselves are decent (maybe some beginner exercises are too easy). It's clear the app developers don't speak English as their first language, but it doesn't get too much in the way of understanding the content. PS The developer removes all reviews <5 stars (3rd time I posted)",3.0
Vyacheslav Pak,Non_Functional,"I'd say the app is great for workout. However, for some reason it bugs on my pixel 8 from time to time. Whenever I want to browse the app for longer than 3 minutes it starts to glitch and so I can't tap on anything. Restarting the app works but it's still very annoying. Fix please",3.0
Simone Romiti,Non_Functional,"Very useful app, but: 1. Too few stretching exercises 2. It was better before, when the full body 30 days challenge was only for the upper part of the body. It would have been useful to keep it, simply changing the name. Personally I found it very good in combination with the same challenge for legs. The present full body 30 days challenge is still insufficient for the legs.",3.0
Kyriafinis Bill,Non_Functional,"I would like better integration with the google fit app, I would like to see more information there about the program and gain heart points (witch I currently don't) in the app. Everything else is almost perfect. The app is very easy to set up and use and has very nice graphics explaining each excersise. One minor thing is that I don't get notifications for work outs. Also I would like to be able to schedule specific programs for each day of the week so I can keep better track of my programs.",3.0
DesignPups,Non_Functional,"Pros: Lots of workouts, all free with ads. Unlike most of the competition, the app isn't intentionally made useless if you decide not to pay for it, which is great. Cons: Seems like a pattern with Leap Fitness Group, - what could've been a single, convenient app, is split into a bunch of apps, all differing even in functionality for no apparent reason. Home Workout and the Lose Weight App could easily be combined into a single app. Same with different apps for men and women.",3.0
Roberto Gerosa,Non_Functional,"It's a fantastic app and I'm really happy with the results so far. There's only one little aspect that made me rate 3 stars, I'm using Android while my wife is using the same app on iPhone and even if we're both on the premium plan my wife app looks much better, from graphics to interface everything look much more professional on iPhone. I'm a bit disappointed as even aesthetic is part of the experience, well at least for me",3.0
READ5458,Non_Functional,"Would have been a 5 but the voice coach, is supposed to speak at the beginning, during and at the end of an exercise set. It doesnt speak, instead, it sounds like a corrupt 56k dial up tone or tired 30 year old hard drive. This means you need your phone in sight to see the end of timed workout exercises. Have uninstalled and reinstalled several times on different devices, same issue. Otherwise, the workouts do work well and they DO produce results so long as you eat smart and sleep well.",3.0
Paritosh Singh,Non_Functional,"I really love this app, whenever I feel like to workout at home I use this app, recently I downloaded this app and found few features missing which I'm pretty sure you guys added them before like option to select exercises with or without equipment and option to change the animated character. I really miss those features since I got few equipments at home.",3.0
Kay S,Non_Functional,"Simple app w/ decent free workouts, but the difference between workout experience levels is minimal, ads are sometimes so broken that I can't get to the actual workout (one ad that pops up has no X option, so I have to repeatedly restart the app), and the chime after each workout is SO much louder than the vocal coach or the countdowns that my dog's anxiety goes off from the other room and he panics. I had to uninstall since the bell can't be turned off. Would keep, if ad bug and bell are fixed.",3.0
Blake Falls,Non_Functional,"Overall, love the app. I just wish there were more tips and tricks with making sure youre in the right positions and maybe adding a yoga/specifically stretching section. It would be great for off days and to jumpstart my morning getting out of bed and pushing for that motion first thing when it may be difficult to jump right into my daily workout.",3.0
Luca Gentile (Cyclorbit),Non_Functional,"Free app (with ads) to do any possible exercise at home. It has a schedule system or a one time exercise option. THE GOOD There is enough rest between an excercise and another. Free app. Many option and all level of excercise Videos, not automatic though, you have to open them by yourself. THE BAD Simple animation without many details. To open a video you have to do it manually. Ads. Computerized voice. BOTTOM LINE The app is smart and works good, but in my opinion is overrated.",3.0
Caffidget,Non_Functional,"So I really like the app, but with the newest update, the voice countdown and trainer voice are not working. That is a huge issue as the final 3 second countdown is necessary to get in position for timed workouts. Hope this gets fixed soon. Besides that it is a great app.",3.0
Mohamed mahir,Non_Functional,"I didn't want to rate it lower since it's a great app, but it's has an issue which is you lost all the progress if you just change the music through an other app or use an other app even if it's just seconds,and you have to start all over again, I been working out for more than one hour and I lost the progress because I changed a song I don't like and the app record only 10 min of work out",3.0
CraigDavid Mukasa,Non_Functional,"This app has been pretty okay for like the last 2 months but I just noticed it restarts your workout if you open it in pop up view which is annoying. When you minimise the app in the pop up view on a Samsung note 10, the app restarts your entire workout when you open it on full screen. Surely you should be able to say play music or an audio book in the background while working out since it's motivation to some of us. This should be fixed in the next update or at least a feature to play an audio book and/or music should be added so that you don't have to move from one app to another which is distracting and time wasting",3.0
Jay Alok,Non_Functional,"Great app, great workouts. Good for people like me who have zero access to a gym or any sort of equipment. However, a dark mode for the app would be appreciated. Please add a dark mode to the app. (Lack of dark mode is why I'm reducing the stars). Overall, good.",3.0
Danny K.,Non_Functional,"Workout is a bit too hard, even though I was honest with the app. If I choose it was too hard and that I should maybe get an ""easier plan"", it just gives me the option of restarting back to square 1 with a longer and harder workout. Or to use my previous plan. Some days are just push-ups with harder ones in them. This app is OK but making me loose hope.",3.0
Matt Nicolls,Non_Functional,"Really wish I could give 5 stars but some really basic things make this app lacking. For one, the in app feedback goes to an email that is full so your email gets sent back. Second, the full body 7x4 challenge is actually just upper body and abs. For some reason lower body is separate. Then when you finish all 28 days and want to start again you can't. Its just done. I really like this app and will try to keep using it but these basic things make it extremely frustrating.",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Workouts are good and helpful. There are two issues am facing. 1) I am okay with you giving ads before and after workouts, but the type of add that are popping up I have complaint on that. 2) I suggest you provide your own videos as example rather than linking to someone else's YouTube videos, the issue is some of the videos are blocked or no more available.",3.0
Brad Asbury,Non_Functional,Has to be fake reviews for this app. It's not a great app. It's ok. Horrible cheap computer audio. Full body workouts are upper body only. Can't much on the settings of the pre determined workouts so if it's too easy or too hard there isn't much you can do.,3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Pros 1. Great for quick guided home workout. 2. Voice coach is an excellent addition Cons 1. Animation graphics do make it look a bit cheap 2. Would be great to have option of entering time estimates for reps to allow for a more seamless workout with minimal screen interaction,3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Perfect app for calisthenics lovers but not that intense even on the advance mode as compare to a gym regime. Used this without resting (by skipping all the rests) but i feel like i did only warmup as it contains a lot of stretching exercises and not any intensive ones. Overall it's a very good app for the beginners, keep it up team 👍👍",3.0
Chris Schaal,Non_Functional,"This app has good workouts, and a good system to teach you workouts that you may not have done. There is an ad at the beginning and end of most workouts, but these ads are usually skipable after 5 seconds. There are small pop up ads during some exercises, but they are so small you probably won't notice them. My only complaint is that the buttons are very small and can make this app annoying to use if your hands are shaking. All things considered, pretty good body weight workout app.",4.0
Cami Heorot,Non_Functional,"I really enjoy this app, it has a nice amount of different workouts and stretches. I also like that it's simple yet effective in its use and not complicated to follow since it gives descriptions or videos on how to do certain things. I do wish they had more categories though, most of it is based on muscle gain or weight loss, but it'd be nice if they added workout and stretching categories for mood boosting/ease anxiety and for those with mobility issues or elderly.",4.0
Alisa Shaw,Non_Functional,"What's up with all these 5 star 1 word reviews? I don't quite believe them. This app is okay, better than NTC since Nike ruined it. The ads aren't too disruptive, and it has a good simple format, with an overview of the workout, a preview of the next move, and one tap to skip to the next. Good thing you can also skip the excessive recovery period between every exercise. You also need to come into this app with a good knowledge of technique. The little animations don't help much.",4.0
Rj Andrrsun,Non_Functional,"Great job at explaining and showing how to do the exercises without wasting time, UI is easy to navigate and simple the color palette needs to be lightened up, exercises are challenging enough to cause your muscles to grow without being impossible which is enjoyable,",4.0

Shompa karmakar,Non_Functional,Good app for those who wants to build a good body but their parents are not allowing. It's my first day using this app. I know it's much quick to tell but I think it will work,4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Great app. Very easy to use which really helps me to exercise and if your short of time there are quick workouts. Of course like all exercise you need to keep at it, but it's had been a week and already I have noticed an improvement, both physically and mentally. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because it would be useful if it had a warm up and down section with stretches (or for them to Incorporated into the exercise routines if you wanted) that would make the app perfect.",4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Ok for beginners. The workout schedules are easy enough to follow, and they have little cartoon animation for every exercise. However, even the most advanced routines are way too low intensity for anyone who has some experience with bodyweight training. And the only way they make it harder is to add more reps, which gets pretty boring and ineffective at some point.",4.0
Varun Ramakrishnan,Non_Functional,"Been using it for two years now and it's still my go to for workouts. It has an impressive collection that will quench whatever workout thirst you have. The only thing I think can be added to make it better is a dark mode. There's so much white that can be replaced, and dark mode will look even better with the already exisilting blue colour scheme.",4.0
Chris Hallski,Non_Functional,"The great: excercises, illustrations, built-in-timer, voice prompts, tracking your history: all top-notch. The awful: currently on day 4 of a 7x4 ""full body"" challenge. Day 1 consisted of 2 sets of 4 varieties of push-ups, day 2 was a good variety of core, day 3 was shoulders and back... so far ok. Day 4 is back to push-ups. So far the only thing I've seen remotely approaching a leg exercise was mountain climbers. The full-body challenge coach definitely needs some work.",4.0
Callum K,Non_Functional,"It's an amazing app, but I have to knock off a star, the app asks what your fitness level is before you begin, and how many push ups you can manage. I entered 30. The first days workout wanted nearly 90, that's far too many for someone to push themselves through, use the app as a guide, but if you start losing form during an exercise, stop and move on to the next. There's also no reminder for rest days, the daily notifications are great for encouragement; but they should include days for rest",4.0
Olwethu Shezi,Non_Functional,"The application is super cool cause it measures on your ability to workout thus you can also set up your schedule which reminds you everytime . I would recommend this app to beginners, intermediates and also professionals ,a good 4 stars .The only thing that would better their app is if only the workout examples could move just to show how an exercise is done besides that its perfect.",4.0
Valian A,Non_Functional,"I love the premise and it's an amazing source of information! It does feel like the exercises are randomly generated from a list, I had like 8 pushup exercises in a row, lol. That kind of threw me, but with some improvising I get good results anyways :)",4.0
realnotnik,Non_Functional,"I would say everything is perfect in this app, but there's one thing that exercise aren't balanced.

Ali Mashhadi GP3A,Non_Functional,"I really like it actually. It's making me become even stronger, But, the thing is that when I am doing stuff like push ups a LOT, Then it gets tiring and I can't help my blood pressure.

J Abishek,Non_Functional,"I been using this for 4 years. The workout plan are great with No equipment than just body weight. The 7 x 28 days challenge is great concept.

Yes this app has ads nowadays but that doesn't distrub the elegant of this app.",4.0
ansab mattummal,Non_Functional,"I have tried many other workout apps before but, this thing is completely different. It gives you workout that focus on different parts completely and the combination are so effective too. I recommend upgrading this app more. You should bring workouts for more body parts like wrist, calfs,lowerback and more specific plans",4.0
CJ Helena,Non_Functional,"Great app for home-exercising! It's got just enough exercises on the free subscription to maintain my body between gym-days. The timer-system is good, and the instructions for each exercise. I like that you have the 'done'-button after certain reps, I can take my time to perfect technique instead of having to be ""fast"" with each rep. You can customise and keep track of your workouts easily, and the different levels of exercise (easy, moderate, hard) is great for progress and short-term goals!",4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I've been using this app for more than one year, it an awesome app that has really helped my body to be in good shape. However, I am asking that you include data backup to this app. Also, find a way of making the daily workouts to be a little a bit tougher whenever someone finishes 28 day workout, just to ensure that there is always tougher challenges.",4.0
crazy mike,Non_Functional,"So I was looking for an app like this for some time. And I'm glad I found one that I'm not paying $500 dollars a month for. My only complaint is that the full body workout only goes for 28 days. If there is anyway to have a full-body workout that I could do daily for as long as I need to then I would definitely upgrade my rating to a 5 star. Again it's my only complaint, I don't mind the adds and I feel that the app adjusts appropriately. And I am using this app to try and get into shape.",4.0
Amy Pharris,Non_Functional,"I like it so far, but some of the beginner routines aren't super beginner friendly. Specifically a lot of the upper body workouts include sets of full push ups, but I can barely do one push up per workout starting. The rest of the exercises are pretty closely tuned though, so the options to make the whole workout easier aren't helpful. For the moment I'm just doing the push up sets and taking it at my pace. Probably going to have to repeat week one a couple times to get to the starting line.",4.0
Arvind Gautam,Non_Functional,"Excellent app with a clean interface. The option to access each instance of a workout by watching an ad is great.

I find there are some flaws to the app, but if you're trying to be honest especially technologically, it shouldn't be an issue.",5.0
Austin Danisher,Non_Functional,Update: it has been 6 months since I started using the app and it has continued to be great. The minor visual update is great too. Thank you! Great so far! This app is ad supported when free or you can pay to remove the ads and use it with some other benefits. I will likely pay for it as some point as I greatly appreciate the options and implementation. The ads aren't too obtrusive and the content great. Will likely stick with this app for a long time if first impressions are to be trusted.,5.0
Meltman,Non_Functional,"This app is great. It really helped me get into the groove of muscle training. There are a few downsides, but none of them are major. Sometimes the exercises can be a bit difficult to properly perform, even with the app's instructions. Also, I'm not entirely sure which exercise sets I should pick for certain purposes. After doing the upper body challenge, I'm not entirely sure where to go next. But I seem to be figuring it out as I go, so it probbaly won't be much of an inconvenience in the end.",5.0
Barrett DeYoung,Non_Functional,"I really like this app because the controls are really easy to use and the simplicity is really comforting. they have a range of workouts depending on difficulty and time too which is nice if I'm busy or can't handle a lot or if I want to do a lot. there aren't many ads either except for when you finish a workout or if you're trying to do a premium workout in which case you just have to watch a 30 second ad if you don't want to buy premium. overall, it's a really good app.",5.0

Edit: I've never really used it before as much as I currently am due to quarantine. After a recent update, the app runs better.

ACE FIVE GAMING,Non_Functional,walmart everything is better for you even if its no good for you they payed the most to get better ratings tropicana has a poor rating of 30 because its to sweet but 100% walmart juice has the same stuff but gets a 60 🤑 (nutritional facts are the same should be the same rating) and is exactly the same product made in the same factory just different bottle 😵😘🤯,3.0

Stephen Foley,Non_Functional,"I really like the idea of this app and think it has a lot of potential, but so often I will see the same product, with one saying good and the other saying bad. A good example was toothpaste. Where I kept seeing duplicates with different ratings. I also do think that the ingredients list can sometimes be slightly inaccurate, which can lead to varying results eg having titanium dioxide vs titanium dioxide 2. But when I check the actual product it had the same ingredients list",3.0
Kim Bosley,Non_Functional,Scanned everything. Usual culprets identified. Some surprises. It does not recognize bioengineered food ingredients. I have to still read labels. It rates pace salsa as good rating of 60 with bioengineered ingredients. No go with me. The hazardous warnings are valuable. I will probably remove.,3.0
Justin Levy,Non_Functional,"Good app, but needs inprovements. It's fantastic that it shows the additives in items and their inherent risk, however the app should show full ingredients as well. Food labels can be a difficult to read due to the small fonts, so seeing them on the app would be great, simply saying ""some vegetables"" is not good enough. Maybe show more nutritional info too like RDA etc. I also recommended the dev responds to reviews. As it stands not worth paying for, but a solid 3.5 stars and has potential",3.0
Nana Z,Non_Functional,"This app is convenient for looking up and learning ingredients to avoid allergies, but the ratings are so unreliable. It mind blows me how they would rate a makeup product ""poor"" just from having a single essential preservative. They don't take into account the dose. Also some foreign products are rated ""good"" when the ingredient list isn't even complete. It's like all the database is manually updated by users, and reviewed by robots.",3.0
Martin Naylor,Non_Functional,"Work in progress. Tried it on a few things and although it works, it only seems to care about fat, sugar and salt; less so about food being ultra processed for now.",3.0

And is ready for your shopping.yo don't have to do anything. All there is ⚒️⚒️⛏️ to do is pick go and start packing. To me this is what I call technology fast and easy.",3.0
James Muir,Non_Functional,"Cool idea. Mostly useful for its details on additives but it's not perfect there either. Many additives that should be listed are not called out. Treatment of fats is overly-simplistic, and warnings about salt are based on old and dated information. On the bright side, the scanner is ridiculously fast and easy to use.",3.0
Maday Gautron,Non_Functional,Not accurate enough. You seem to take everything into consideration when rating. But you fail to take the type of oil the products contain. You totally disregard canola oil as it is known to be horrible for our health.,3.0
Christine,Non_Functional,"Great for personal care products but just alright for food. If you scan something like an organic avocado oil salad dressing it will rate it 30/100 because it ""has too many calories"" and I don't need that in my life.

John Hancock,Non_Functional,"It did find some item but many did not. Even did not find nescafe coffee!

Darth Enigma,Non_Functional,"Hello, the App works great so far and it's easy to use. I do have one question, I've tried using it on a banana and a lemon, the circular sticker with the bar code, but it doesn't work for some reason.

Pola P,Non_Functional,"This is a great app, but one thing could be improved. I saw many products that have ingredients missing because someone didn't scan properly. Then you have an option to report a problem, and you have the option to scan the package that has ingredients in it. And here is the problem, because there is no option to choose between flat or round packaging. Last time, I reported a change, scanned round package, and still ingredients were missing because I could only upload one photo.",3.0
Melissa Watt,Non_Functional,"Great app!! However there needs to be a manual search option and an option to search for products that you don't have an availiable barcode to scan. Sometimes you may no longer have the box. If these were added, i would rate 5 stars.",3.0
Nathaira,Non_Functional,"The idea is good, but that some languages/countries are not supported makes it useless.

Dannielle Jones,Non_Functional,I've found quite a few products that are not on the app. I've tried to add the same product twice now and comes back unable to read ingredients.

Attomic Chicken,Non_Functional,"Yuka has really improved form its inception here in Australia. I've updated my rating accordingly. I would like to see a manual search field and shortcuts when I tap and hold the app. Sure. Scan, search, favourites.

Although I like Yuka — it's a little dissapointing that they still haven't introduced the search functionality here. Deducted one star. Still waiting for the manual search",3.0
Doug MacIntyre,Non_Functional,Nice idea but needs work. Need to be able to size the photo area as it doesn't always get everything on the nutrition label.

Jessica Bland,Non_Functional,I paid for premium. I am going to give it a year to see if the issues with the app are fixed. Some of the descriptions don't match the product. I scanned fish seasoning and it said it was alcohol. Multiple entries for a product. One says Excellent but with no ingredient list while another says Bad with ingredients. It doesn't list Talc as a harmfull ingredient which is frustrating as that is what led me to wake up to the fact that there are harmful chemicals in our products and download the app.,3.0
Tyler Hoerner,Non_Functional,"Updating my review to reflect the recent app update. It seems the data unavailable for common products was unintended and the developer was able to resolve in short order. I still stand by my initial feedback that showing nutritional highlights (additives, sugar, fat, etc) would still be highly beneficial to the user despite the lack of rating on certain product types. Outside of that the app works rather well, it's an easy interface, snappy, and saves previous searches which is a nice touch.",4.0
Taylor Willis,Non_Functional,"I LOVE this app!! It's helped me so much with cutting all the junk our if my life and all it takes is a quick scan. I love that they provide articles as to why the additives are bad instead of just saying so, so you can be more informed of what you are consuming. The developers also get back to you super quick when it comes to adding new products. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish that they could expand to cover things like detergent and cleaning supplies.",4.0
r3dbl00dbl3nd,Non_Functional,"This app is amazing! I do wish it had more studies in English as most of them are in Spanish, but translating with technology is not really an issue. You get everything the app has to offer without premium except a search bar, but you don't really need it unless you're trying to buy products online I guess. But you can scan anything in store and not only get information on that product, but recommendations for products better for you that are similar! Will be using for everything I buy!",4.0
Dan Kay,Non_Functional,"I love this app. It helps me make better decisions when buying products. The only thing I wish it would do is let you exclude ingredients. Fo example, I want dessert but it's labeled a 9/100 because it has too much sugar (Duh). I would love to exclude sugar content from scores or some ingredients that I made a decision about I want to include.",4.0
Daniel Nicoletti,Non_Functional,"Fantastic app, but does need a way to add custom weightings.. eg as a diabetic id love to be able to weight sugar even harder than it is in the app... Also doesn't distinguish between good fats in say organic coconut flakes and bad fats. As others have mentioned would also be good to be able to negatively weight some ingredients that you were allergic to. I really should rate this 5 stars as it is generally an awesome app, but just a reflection that's a few extra features would make it +++",4.0
AJ 95,Non_Functional,"I like this app. Citations for the additives is brilliant and the app works flawlessly so far. My only reason for 4/5 stars is how additives, salt, fat and sugar are weighted. For example, Doritos and Orville popcorn both are ""bad"". Doritos had 10 additives and the popcorn had 1 (annatto). Setting preferences is in the premium version but it doesn't seem that additive-free or something similar is an option. If additive options are soon to be released I'd love to know.",4.0
S&A Best,Non_Functional,"Love that it provides links to studies on the undesirable ingredients. Wish it didn't define things like butter as ""orange"" zone based on fat, as the body requires natural fats. Funny people like the Amish ONLY use butter and aren't obese... it's the seed oils and vegetable oils this app says are ""good"", but there's many of us who know that's wrong. So it's a great help, but it's not fully on the ball. It's a great app in the making and lots of effort has been poured into it. ⭐️4.5",4.0

It must be ameliorated. Otherwise, it's very easy to use and the bar code scanner is impressive. EDIT: I appreciate the reply, but it is not reliable, I'm sorry. As a consumer, make sure you double-check the nutritional values if you're basing your purchase on its rating. I am seeing a lot of nutritional values given for 100g that should be on 20g for example, dividing by 5 the fat, salt, etc. Dev, continue improvement, you have something great in your hands.",4.0

Nathan Hafner,Non_Functional,"I love this app! It's a very user friendly interface, no set up needed, and the features are very efficient and intuitive.

I wish you could customize your dietary needs because of varying body types which is why I rated 4/5.",4.0
Ricki-Lee Carroll,Non_Functional,"I love this!!! This app will literally be my favourite thing ever!! But if I could suggest 1 thing. Would it be possible to consider an update to upload a barcode from our gallery?

However, I have noticed that even the products that score high, often contain ""parfume"" which is highly toxic and rated in this app under ""no risk"" I find this disappointing to say the least",4.0
Ayana,Non_Functional,I love Yuka I use it all the time and I tell everyone about it. I payed like $5 for the premium because I really dig what they are all about. The only thing I would like to see is if the rating on food cpuld be customized to what kind of diet the user is trying to stick to and get recommendations based on those specifications. Some food are have low ratings due to certain things that are not a concern for me or vise versa they will have a high rating but have something that I am avoiding.,4.0
Emily Kemker,Non_Functional,Get it! I used to think so my natural products were clean with no harmful chemicals. Never have I been so wrong in my life! This app is really easy to use with it's barcode scanner. I love how it also give alternative products if the product you scanned has harmful additives. Not all matches match the greatest for some products but that's ok. I actually found out that one of the foods I ate was giving me migraines. I was shocked when I read the additives side effects in the curry.,5.0
Dave Potts,Non_Functional,"Super helpful app! I've been using the app for a few weeks. I have scanned many products at home, and at the store while shopping. There have only been a couple times when I found an odd result. Example: a microwave popcorn showed poor, but the same popcorn in a different size box showed good. Otherwise, it really helps point out the downside of some products I thought were healthy when they really are not, and better choices for many products.",5.0
Nic Castro,Non_Functional,Such a game changer for me with leading me in the right direction to a better me. I've had this app for over a year. This past weekend I experienced an issue with a product I scanned one day and it said it was Bad. Looked at my log and noticed it was changed to Excellent 100/100. I was baffled because I made plans to return the item. I looked at the ingredients and only about 2% of the was in it was written down. So make sure you double check the ingredients!

David Rask,Non_Functional,Distance feature is pretty accurate....The steps weren't however werent entirely accurate. I was walking a brisk pace and it was counting three steps to two in some instances. Also a huge battery drain because you have to have the app run in the background if you want to count all day steps. My phone was more than half dead (45%) at the end of the day when normally it's still at 80%. So this single app is draining an extra 40-50% of my battery Not worth it in my opinion 🤷,3.0
Vasudeva M,Non_Functional,This is a brilliant app and have been using it for quite some time. But lately the app just stops counting. To get it to start working I have to clear storage and cache.

Ted Doll,Non_Functional,"great when it works. first, it requires a cell or wifi connection or it doesnt work at all. next, there are days when i walk a lot - twice in the last week I walked over 3 miles and the app reported 1,000 to 2,000 steps. I wear the phone in the same place.",3.0

Elizabeth Thrippleton,Non_Functional,"It's a pretty good app. My only issue is that when you increase your goal, it stops counting previous days with lesser goals as successful.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"App itself is OK but alas, on my Android 9 phone (2038x1080 pixel display) the home screen widget is an unusable mess due to way too big characters that just don't fit. For example, when the actual step count is 4567, the widget will show only a huge 4 and left part of the huge 5: the rest of the number remains invisible because the too-big characters run outside the widget border! As the widget is not resizable, the full number will never fit, and if it were resizable, it would be too big.",3.0
Scott,Non_Functional,"Does the job you want. I hate achievements/ fireworks for hitting benchmarks, though, and i cant find a way to turn those off... seems silly but it's true.

Floris Prins,Non_Functional,"So far i like the app, been using it for one day.

Kaiden H,Non_Functional,"It's a great app for what it is, but for someone who works thirds (like me) it's very difficult to track how many steps I'm actually doing in one of my ""days"", because it resets at midnight. The ability to set the start and end of my day, in the app, would be a seriously great feature to have.",3.0
Ammar Ahmed,Non_Functional,It's very accurate I have tried others and settled on this for quite a while now Thumbs Up Update: The app closes on the background randomly and stops couting steps. It needs restarting to get it running in the background. The disturbing part is you might be running for 20 minutes but once it closes you never know about the progrss after it,3.0
Subhangi Panigrahi,Non_Functional,"I'm edited my review and rating it 3 star instead because I've been using this app for 2 years now and now I realize that the app data was nearly 15 GB. It was hard to delete in one go and every time I tried to uninstall it, my phone got switched off 😭. It's a good app for short term use though I suppose. The steps are pretty accurate and the data collected is reliable. Kinda why I ended up using it for 2 years straight.",3.0
Rick Neale,Non_Functional,Seems reliable and accurate. Very pleased with it. Update. Well after using it for a while it don't appear to be any more reliable than others I've tried. Walked 5+ mile today it recorded 2097 steps. Gigantic steps. Useless.,3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I was really pleased with this App to start with but recently have noticed that the amount of steps I do each day is not always noted correctly on the daily step breakdown once the day is over. E.g. I walked over 10,000 steps on several days but once I look at the daily performance it seems to drop, showing roughly 700 less than I actually did. Took a screenshot the other day to prove it to myself",3.0
Gary Reilly,Non_Functional,"The app tends to switch on and off, so is not quite reliable to track daily steps. I've had times when I've been walking for an hour and a half, but there will be only 50 mins and the relevant steps to those 50 mins recorded.",3.0

My only objection is the bmi thing. Otherwise, works fine!",3.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"First day it worked really well and the next day it is just not counting. Neither the steps, nor calories. I did not understand what went wrong..

Michael Hoffman,Non_Functional,"Really liked the app, but it significantly drained the battery on my phone. The phone is ~3 weeks old and was going 5+ days between recharges before installing the app. Went down to 2-3 days after. I know the problem isn't actually the app. It's the battery suckage that occurs from monitoring the gryo sensor all the time. Any step counting app I'd install would have the same issue. Nonetheless, it's not a desireable situation for me, so I unstalled the app and spluged on an $8 pedometer.",3.0

Mohammad Azhar,Non_Functional,Well There is surely a problem with distance measurment in this app. The ratio of calories burnt in comparison to distance covered also needs to be checked. When a travel from one point to another it always calculates the distance far less than what google map shows,3.0
Michael Shannon,Non_Functional,"The big problem is that it is so poor at distance. I walked for exactly 4 miles on a marked track and it came up with 2.5, 2.58, and 2.63. the interface it makes it also hard to analyze performance within a day.",3.0
Nanani,Non_Functional,"I loved this app for over a year, it's simple and efficient, no useless info, not to many adds. Why 3 stars then ?

CreeDo Lala,Non_Functional,"Two things keep it from 5-star. 1. it blasts sound without any setting to disable it. So you'll be in public and get an embarrassing cheering crowd when you open it. 2. The first thing you see when you launch the app, is some kind of pop up about your step count that you have to close. It blocks the information I actually wanted to see. Nobody likes having to close a pop up. Just show the info. Otherwise pretty good app, counts steps accurately.",4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Great app! Appreciate the interface-pretty attractive. However, been trying to get rid of the notification bar counter for a while. There should be the option to simply see a report notification at the end of the day. The only way to get rid of the counter it seems, is to block all notifications. The respective toggle button in-app is not responsive.",4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"The app uses the phone accelerometer to detect foot impact. So, if you shuffle there is nothing to detect. Further, some pedometers are sensitive to pace/cadence. The most accurate pedometers for slow walkers work best at 50 to 60 steps per minute. I don't know if this is a factor with this app. I do know that when I could take full paces without shuffling it was more accurate.",4.0
J C,Non_Functional,This app tracks every step you take unlike other apps I've used that takes a while to load your steps. However I noticed that it stops counting your steps when you have certain apps open. I was listening to a live video on youtube while I was walking and noticed that it had stopped counting my steps so I had to close the app. Also when I was walking I opened google maps and had it open for 10 minutes. Again it didn't count those steps. I'm glad it works when spotify is open though. Always check,4.0
Natalie Poplos,Non_Functional,"Definitely recommend this app easy to use has fun little little things that make you feel you accomplished something. Plus I like the fact you can set you goal steps and change your goal steps as you start reaching your set goal back to back days consecutively. I started this app to see how many steps I take a day since the job I do has a lot of walking. Now in pushing myself to take the long way to get to where I need to, or take the steps instead of the elevator, etc just to get more steps 💪",4.0
Dezeray B,Non_Functional,"I use this app only to count my steps. It is really accurate and intuitive for that. If I set my phone down, adding steps it missed it easy too, so I like that. It is frustrating because if I change the step goal it applies that change retroactively and all the previos days I had met my goal are then unmet days. Maybe there is a way to fix this? I have not found it. Not sure if it every gives verbal feed back but it does do cute little celebration animations when you met seemingly Random goals.",4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"So I had this awesome app on my old LG phone for months, and it worked great! You have to fiddle around with the settings a little bit, but it does work! Since I got a brand new phone with Android PIE, this app no longer seems to work correctly. I do get my morning report (which is usually inaccurate) but during the day I cannot visually see my steps, which sort of defeats the purpose if you're using the app why I'm using the app, to MAKE sure I get 10k steps a day. I would love to hear the devs opinion on why this is happening.",4.0
Monique Lapre,Non_Functional,It's good for a daily tracker of my steps. My only criticism is that it doesn't open up automatically every day. I often forget to open the app. Therefore the count of my steps is of often inaccurate. But if I can remember to open the app then it's a great tracker. Just opened it to see my total for today after a 3 hour workout and it read that I did 74 steps and none yesterday! What's up with that? Evidently this app doesn't work! I don't recommend it for anyone!,4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Its pretty acurate but, I found that if you shake your phone up and down or even back and forth, it logs it in as steps. I'm sure it's not the only step app that does that. Obviously it uses motion detection to log steps. I have had it running while driving and it does not log any steps, which I found good since you're in motion while driving.",4.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I really like this app as I can just set my phone in my pocket and look at my accomplishment at the end of the day.

Pete Oubsuntia,Non_Functional,"Pretty good app. It is easy to use and I appreciate how it calculates the amount of calories burned based on your weight.

Richard Langellotti,Non_Functional,"Had the same app on my previous phone. It looks different compared to the old phone, bit the functionality is the same. I learned something surprising from this app: just going around the house I can log a mile of walking. My house isn't huge (5300 Sq. ft including the basement), but it's very spread out. Gives very useful info when I go hiking.",5.0
Crash J,Non_Functional,"This app is so easy to understand and use that even my 74 yr old dad can use it with no difficulty, and he's still learning how to use his very first smartphone! It tells you how many steps and miles you've walked in a day, the amount of time you've spent walking, and how many calories you've burned. It also tracks BMI, reminds you to drink waters, and has customizable exercise goals. Your stats are straightforward and simple to read. Its free but if there are ads then I haven't noticed them.",5.0
Sara F.,Non_Functional,"This app is exactly what I was looking for. I hate the Google Fit tracking so I downloaded this instead. All features are free, there are a few ads but they don't pop up all the time. I like that you can change the sensitivity of the step monitor and that it had a bar that can easily be checked in your notifications.",5.0
Tania Lester,Non_Functional,"Simple, easy to use. Even easy to troubleshoot! I do wish it would automatically save and upload all the data when you get a new phone or number, though. That would be nice if y'all could make that happen. In all reality I would've given y'all only 🌟🌟🌟🌟 ½ if it was available, but the only thing I can even try to complain about it the lack of auto-transfer for data. Great job y'all!",5.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"So far, I love it. Better than the others I've used. Still learning the capabilities. I work as a cashier so I don't walk a lot at work but I do a lot of work moving merchandise back and forth at checkout and have no idea what the calories used are. This can be set at high sensitivity and seems to catch at least some of the effort while in my back pocket. This gives me a little better estimate of my calories needs and may explain some of my unexpected hunger and weight ups and downs.",5.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I love this app. It's simple, but it works well and I love the format. You can turn on notifications to tell you when it's time to drink water. As you go, you unlock goals and achievements. You can adjust the sensitivity of the step sensor and the length of your steps for more accuracy. It's great for people looking to be more active but need that push. Awesome! You gotta deal with short ads if ya dont want to pay for the supreme features. But hey, overall- great app!!",5.0
Mike Martin,Non_Functional,"Simple, no fuss app that gives your steps, distance and time all at the same time. It also keeps a seven day log so you can see if you've improved, stayed the same, or just took it easy one day. And you can just put your phone in the back pocket, unlike some apps which require you to have your phone nestled with your keys and such in the front. Simplicity is the key to this app...",5.0
Justin Silvis,Non_Functional,"I have done personal growth and self-development for last 10 years and this app has been the most beneficial!

Jessica Bryant,Non_Functional,"I used to love this app, it's great at planning workouts for you and you can easily add in or remove new ones for the week or bump them to next week. For the food part, I wish it provided the nutrition facts. I'm so upset the see all button disappeared where you could see all the recommended workouts in a better view week to week and move them around. I can't believe they removed this feature.

Jenna Roadifer,Non_Functional,"I used to love this app and still love the workouts. But lately, videos take 5+ minutes to load and the pause, rewind, and fast-forward buttons don't show up when the video is full screen?

Please fix.",1.0
S Snyder,Non_Functional,The variety and trainers are top rate. And overall a great app. The lower rating is due to limited filters which would be a very easy fix. And lack of pre-planning a workout /ease to plan. I paid for the premium in hopes bit have canceled. Now looking for new app. It is too bad they do not take feedback seriously cause it really. Old be the best at home out there.,1.0
Jess S,Non_Functional,"They changed the app for the worse since the last time I used it a few months ago. There are like 3 or 4 buttons that do the exact same thing on each tab. I can no longer make my own program (or choose ANY program without Pro for that matter), schedule workouts for a few weeks into the future, remove workouts from a week that they ""recommended,"" or see my planned workouts.

Maria Rachal,Non_Functional,"DONT GET THE PRO!!!! I actually liked the free version but the pro version SUCKS! it doesn't cast the pro music to my tv. You know, the main the reason I got the pro version! Really frustrating that even when I workout on a web browser it has trouble loading the music and the workouts. It's just incredibly annoying to pay for a feature that only works on a super tiny phone screen. I have tried to voice my displeasure through the app but have gotten no response from customer service. Save your $",1.0
E. D.,Non_Functional,"In order to stream to your TV, you need to pay for a membership right away. You cannot test out any classes and stream to your TV to even really know if you want to pay for a membership. It's really hard for me to try a dance cardio class while watching on a small screen. Guess I'll stick with the Xfinity workout videos and Open Fit free trial (always allows you to stream on TV)!",1.0
Geff G,Non_Functional,App is confusing. The trial version doesn't really do anything for you I'd you go to the gym. I searched around on the app and just doesn't look like it's worth the time or money. I deleted it. Update THEY DO NOT STOP SENDING YOU EMAILS. I've unsurscribed like 5 times already and they keep sending you emails. And now they send me alerts to make sure you work out and it's in my calender. I can't delete any of them. It'd all a big scam,1.0
Brandie B,Non_Functional,"I paid for pro to be able to do the programs and put it on the TV. I did my first workout on my TV this morning and it didn't show up as finished on my account. It said continue. I hit continue thinking maybe I left 1 second too soon. It started over and now says I burned 1 cal. Kind of sucks for the numbers. Also heads up, they say samsung devices work with pro but galaxy 4 and 5 do not. Idk if they plan to fix this but evidently it's been a thing for a long time Also u have to email to cancel",1.0
Lyanne Bain,Non_Functional,"The app now likes to open whenever it wants. I select a seperate app and fiton opens. I try to close it and it reopens. It doesn't matter what app it is. It now does it when I try to use Google or Gmail. Customer service has become a joke regarding this situation and solution. Worse of all, I paid for premium and have not used it in months due to the lack of ability to use it when I actually WANT to vs when the app decides to work.",1.0
Jordan Meyer,Non_Functional,Subscribed to fiton pro through website or app but neither Google nor fiton have record of subscription. My card got closed and I have a new number for the same account which is great because I wasn't planning on renewing. But fiton keeps trying to charge an invalid card.

Connie Hildebrand,Non_Functional,I used to love this app. Everytime I click something (and every time it opens) I have to wait for promotional ads for the pro app to stop playing before I can do literally anything. I can't back out or skip; I'm totally held hostage. I hate apps that do this. I get it that you want money for your time. You already won't connect to my Samsung heart rate monitor without a subscription. Just let me live my life. I'll probably delete this app and just rely on biking and jogging.,1.0

Angel K,Non_Functional,"I didn't even get to a work out. I tried putting in my info and was interrupted by multiple ads, and I know its so you pay for the pro version but I didn't even get a chance to try to navigate the app before being constantly bombarded with different pop ups. Not something I want in a workout app, especially for someone like myself who already struggles with staying on task and working out. Also the app seemed cluttered while trying to navigate through it.",1.0
Sabrina Sgandurra,Non_Functional,"Really upset by this app. I used to be able to cast my workouts to my TV without needing a pro subscription and now they've locked that ability. Very disappointed. It was one thing to lock certain workouts or features of the app for the pro subscription, that I could deal with, but something as basic as casting to your TV? That defeats the entire purpose of the app for most people. Very very disappointed and will not recommend this app to anyone.",1.0
Dawn Ippoma-Powell,Non_Functional,"Very disappointed with this app. Just downloaded it and saw that I needed to pay a subscription for exercise programs and meal plan to be unlocked. So, I upgraded to Pro version only then to find out that there's courses and programs that still require extra payments. This is not OK. At first, it appears that upgrading unlocks everything. It doesn't. What an earth was the £27.99 for? It's not clea, so I feel that was a scam move. 😕 fiton you need to do better than that!",1.0
Tracy Izell,Non_Functional,Paid for upgrade and can't access. Wants me to keep upgrading. Trying to unsubscribe!,1.0
M C,Non_Functional,"Casting is terrible The only reason I upgraded to Pro was to be able to cast because the workouts are excellent. Unfortunately, casting is always out of sync and therefore useless. You cant pause or rewind without it spazzing out.

I'm now watching workouts on my phone and wasted my money because I could have done that for free.",1.0
Chris Bentley,Non_Functional,"If you have any major injuries or the in ability to do certain movements, this is not the app for you.

I'm sure this is fantastic for some but definitely not good for those with physical disabilities.",1.0
Laura Brooks,Non_Functional,"Keeps giving me an email saying I'm behind on payments. I haven't subscribed to this app and there is no way to cancel. It says to go settings and click subscriptions.

Alexis Clark,Non_Functional,Not sure if paying for this is worth it. No workout preview without clicking on it to scroll through kind of. Little customization for concerns. Few low impact options. Modifications added late and leaves chance for injury out the gate. Issues with casting and syncing info between TV app and mobile. It subtracted a workout i did on the TV from my mobile. Nothing says motivating like reducing progress!! Kuboko fitness is better. Or bodbot.,1.0
Luca Roma,Non_Functional,"I loved this app but I decided to pay for the premium version and have been so dissapointed. I only paid so I could connect to my samsung galaxy watch only to discover it wont connect to the galaxy watch 4. Then, it wont play music when casting and also wont show the progression bar. I have regretted purchasing premium so much, and when I asked for a refund a few days after joining they just ignored me. Use this app for free, it's great. But DO NOT PAY FOR PREMIUM! 6 months later. No change!!!",1.0
Chantèlle Moolman,Non_Functional,"I used to enjoy this app the free version, now most options are locked because they want you to buy the app, the free version video buffer and if it does continue it has skipped steps, then I have start over, today I couldn't even get on a exercise as it was buffering too much.

I,Non_Functional,"Don't bother with this app. Great workouts. Can't cast even with paid subscription. Really the pro is for music and access to programs. The meal programs while great concept poorly executed. Missing ingredients especially for dressings or sauces. Their customer service is incompetent, lazy and really could care less. Have a student benefit don't bother they wouldn't honor my benefit because my university changed names. If you are going to charge at least fix the recipes and casting issue.",1.0
Mo Al Taleb,Non_Functional,"Not sure if the reviews are fake or paid by the developers.. ! It's a bit misleading to say the app is free!

T J,Non_Functional,"Such a disappointment. I would give this (-) stars if possible. The app immediately links your contacts, even if you choose to skip it. Then they display your age & location.

It was a good 3 months, but the app is worthless to me now unfortunately. Paid a whole year and won't get even a prorated amount back for the unusable (lack of) tracker integration.",1.0
Jessica Bryant,Non_Functional,"I used to love this app, it's great at planning workouts for you and you can easily add in or remove new ones for the week or bump them to next week.

smallfry 34,Non_Functional,"This app is just AMAZING! So far I have done a yoga session and two warm up sessions and I love it! I am only giving 4 stars because you have to pay to see the recipes of the meals/snacks/drinks, which sucks because I love trying new foods and cooking. Edit: and you can't disable the chat. There is an incognito setting but it doesn't work really well. Other than that amazing job developers! Edit #2: for some reason today (7/19/21) the app has been taking forever to load like there is a bug.",4.0
Ruchi Bansal,Non_Functional,"FitOm has been the perfect workout buddy in this pandemic, so much so that I get anxious on days I don't end up working out! But I really like their holistic approach. There is something for everyone here! One thing I would change is the layout of the app since it can get confusing navigating it. What seems to be my workout settings are actually my account settings and vice versa. I would also like them to improve the browse page.Basically, it needs to be more user friendly. But I love this app!",4.0
Cheeks P,Non_Functional,"uploaded the app on my new phone, more ads than before. after a workout it would be nice to just go back to my main page. many options afterwards kind of interrupts the flow. also there seem to be some workouts that are missing. there were desk and seated one for work that I can't find anymore. overall cool app.",4.0
Breanna Green,Non_Functional,This app is actually awesome! I've tried a lot of exercise apps that I didn't like due to ads or the poor quality of the workout. The workouts on here are great and I'm always sore the next day even though they are 20-30 minutes. This app would be PERFECT if only I could mute the background music in the videos and play my own,4.0
Yvonne Eele,Non_Functional,I love this app. I would like it better with one small change. I prefer to watch a workout all the way through before doing it. If there was a way to watch a video in preview mode (but seeing entire video) that would be great. Right now it feels like I'm cheating because the app thinks I worked out to a video that I was just checking out.,4.0
Tamara Francuski,Non_Functional,"App is quite good, workouts can be really challenging if you are not cheating. But there is one minus for meal recipes- I found on quite a few recipes that is missing some ingredients, such as toppings or dressing. It says in process of preparation to mix all the ingredients for dressing, but doesn't say what are the ingredients. So, it's either you have to improvise or change the meal.",4.0
B P,Non_Functional,"Love it, the workouts are great. There isn't a great deal of meals for the vegan section though and also with the meals it doesn't say all of the ingredients in the ingredient list but then in the directions they will add an ingredient. So if somebody wants to follow it directly they will have to guess how much of one ingredient. I love the challenges in the app, they always keep me focused on the workouts and the progress pics can be added too.",4.0
Claire Grant,Non_Functional,"Love this app. So much variety from stretching to weights workouts, as well as different trainers to choose from too. There are no add interruptions which is fantastic. Would rate this higher but I have to force shut the app at the end of the workout as it freezes. But otherwise this I may go to when I need some motivation or variety! Would highly recomend!!",4.0

Asuka Kumagai,Non_Functional,Love fiton! I switched phones and on my pixel I am able to see a sessions category when picking out a workout but not on my Samsung. Luckily I can add session workouts to my recommended list from my pixel so i can do the workoutsbut it is inconvenient. Also I stopped the program get up and move but it continues to be added to my Google calendar. Overall love this app but the things I mentioned makes it 4 stars vs 5.,4.0

Kayla Lippert,Non_Functional,"The workouts are okay. I am not a fan of them not showing modifications. I'm lucky I know how to modify when needed, but many people don't. I wish the nutrition area had more resources, but you have to pay for them, even with the pro version. Edit to my review: they refunded me my yearly sub after I emailed to cancel and said they appreciated the feedback. I think it says a lot that they listen. Adding some stars to my review for good customer service & getting back to me in a timely manner.",4.0
Emma,Non_Functional,"I absolutely love this app and have been using it for years. However, I decided to pay for the pro so that I could follow the workouts on my TV, but it just wouldn't cast, which was obviously disappointing. I have no issue casting for other apps.

Devin Faria,Non_Functional,"I was originally 5 star, but I decided to give it 4.

That's the main reason why I bought a 6 month subscription. The recipes are still nice though.",5.0
Bonnie Kolbenstetter,Non_Functional,"I'm enjoying the workouts, help videos, and recipes in the pro version. My only issue is with the casting. I can't pause the video if I need to when it's casted on my TV. I tried doing it from my phone and my TV and it doesn't work. Of course I don't want to take breaks when working out but with 2 kids, sometimes it's necessary. Overall, still really like the app and what it has to offer.",5.0
Martha Visconti,Non_Functional,"Love this app. So much versatility. The trainers are all equally great in their style and motivation to keep you moving. I've tried things I wouldn't have otherwise and helped my body with mobility and stretching. The way to search for a workout via time, body part, trainer, style makes it so easy to find something you're looking for. The challenge are great to keep you accountable as well as the invite your friends feature. I've turned my sister onto it and we can do long distance workouts!",5.0
Shauna Greib,Non_Functional,"Best Fitness App! This app has changed my life. It has tons of workouts of different styles, difficulty levels, and lengths of time.

I highly recommend this app!",5.0
Kathy Leonardi,Non_Functional,"I absolutely love this app! So many options to choose from, always have great warm ups and cool downs, and even lots of options on the free app. I also love how I can either hop on to the current workout of the time or schedule my own workouts throughout the week. Although, it would be nice if I could schedule the same workout (i.e. rise and shine yoga) several times a week. However, I've managed my way around that for now. Just would be...a wee bit more convenient is all. Lol",5.0
Alex Kupyna,Non_Functional,"I normally never stick to fitness apps, but I did with this one! I like how there are different workouts recommended for me every day, and they also repeat occasionally. I also like how you can find another workout if you want something different from what is recommended. And best of all, it's free! Edited later: I had to take a break from the app for a month or two due to a busy schedule, but coming back to it was really easy, and I really enjoy seeing my favorite instructors again!",5.0
Christy Hemphill,Non_Functional,"I've used this app almost daily for over a year now, and logged over 650 workouts. I am not typically evangelistic about or all that loyal to any products, but I rave about FitOn to anyone looking for a fitness app. I used to use workout DVDs, but it gets old doing the same routines over and over and expensive to buy new ones and find they aren't really favorites. This app gives almost limitless possibilities for mixing it up and never getting bored. I love being able to switch things up between all the different kinds of workouts. I have exercised regularly for 20+ years and I find the advanced modifications on the level 2 and 3 workouts to be plenty challenging and allow for progression in my fitness level. Over the past year, I've lowered my body fat percentage and gotten noticeably stronger and more flexible. The trainers are very professional and promote safe workouts that don't result in strains and injury. The only thing I wish was that there were better (and longer) dance workouts with decent music tracks. I have to go back to my DVDs to get good Zumba/Bollywood/HipHop dance workouts.",5.0
Kristi S,Non_Functional,"I LOVE this app!!! There are a million workouts to choose from, the instructors are not annoying at all and I've enjoyed every single workout I've done (and I've been using the app for well over a year now)!

I honestly cannot rave enough!!!! JUST TRY IT ALREADY, you'll love it!",5.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I LOVE this app. I admittedly downloaded it months before actually using it, but I've been using it for the past two months and am SO happy with the results. The instructors are phenomenal and the work outs are really good quality in my opinion. There is a huge range depending on what you want to do and I genuinely enjoy the work outs. The more I explore the app, the more helpful things I find. You can even go through the videos and schedule them with reminders so you can plan ahead. Love it!",5.0

Ely Ford,Non_Functional,"I absolutely love this app! There is such a variety of workouts, you cannot get bored with your fitness routine. You are able to choose your workout time, type of workout, trainer, intensity, which makes it so easy to customize to any schedule.

As an additional bonus, I love the inspirational quotes everytime I open the app!",5.0
Nathaly Sanchez,Non_Functional,"I have never paid for diet programs or work out program. However, I was having a difficult time motivating myself and come up with healthy recipes. The FitOn app is amazing i love that I was able to set the intensity of the workouts and how it adjust workouts according to individualized goals. The food is healthy and delicious with so many options to pick from. The food is so delicious, my kids and husband eat it too, which is awesome cause you can easily change the serving sizes. Love it💙",5.0
Fatmir Mollabeqiri,Non_Functional,"Most likely this is the best free workout app available. Supposedly it let's you customize according to your goals, but I found that to be more of a gimmick than a real feature. In reality it is heavily geared towards women. So if you are a guy that is trying to build muscle than look for something else. If you are trying to lose weight, build endurance, and experience whole lot of different workout techniques than this app is perfect for it.",5.0
Christian Wirtz,Non_Functional,"Garbage. Tracking randomly crashes and, if you're unlucky, your progress will reset to 0. I've had multiple evenings where I'll walk 8-10 miles but because of these crashes and lost data, it tracks 2 miles or fewer (once is an accident, twice is coincidence, three times is a pattern). If you want an accurate activity tracker, look elsewhere.",1.0
Dwight Gentry,Non_Functional,"After seeing this app included on several Best app lists, I installed the free version in order to get distance and pace info for my daily walks, but this app was disappointing. I walk varying distances on a riverside bike trail, and there are mile markers along much of my route. The app displayed distances that tended to be about 85% of the actual marked distances, and the pace data was wildly inaccurate (often much slower than actual, sometimes much faster). I guess I'll keep looking.",1.0
R Trussell,Non_Functional,"Was a great app, but after an update in September 2022 or so, it frequently loops back into the ""save workout"" menu. When it does this it won't let me save the workout, and it won't let me discard the workout - just repeats the""save workout"" menu. I have to delete the app and reinstall it to get it to work properly and then it fails within a day or two. It started with a pixel 6, and continues to do it with the new Pixel 7 as well. I have submitted multiple support tickets with no resolution.",1.0
Katt Ness,Non_Functional,"Used to love it. Now I have to uninstall it. Not at all reliable. It only partially tracks your movements. When I finish, it shows a much shorter and inaccurate route (i.e. if I ran the route the way your map shows, I would have had to run through the centers of my neighbors' properties, which would be illegal and physically impossible. I used to love this app, but apparently it's no longer in operation.",1.0
Sara Piazza,Non_Functional,"Very handy, works well! Edited to add, this is garbage. It no longer measures my distance, only calories and time. Goodbye. 10/25/21 edited to say I got to work temporarily but now it won't open. It was apparently hijacked by an offer to upgrade and I have never been able to open it since. Won't let me get past the upgrade screen. When it works it's a great little app but it has not worked very well in the long run, so to speak 10-26-21 you don't understand. I can't get past the update screen",1.0
Jamie W,Non_Functional,"Even after two years and numerous updates, this app is still slower, more glitchy, less accurate, and overall less user-friendly than Endomondo. There is no way to change which stats appear at a glance in the list for past walks; it defaults to distance (which is displayed twice actually) and average pace. If you would rather know your average speed, for example, you have to click on each workout individually. I still miss Endomondo and wish they had never replaced it with this.",1.0
Ashleigh Powell,Non_Functional,"Lately, I can't log anything. When I open the app, it automatically gives me the 'save workout' option, but with no numbers or data. If I try to go back to the main page to start a workout, it will go to that page for 2 seconds before it goes back to the ""save workout"" page before I can click on ""start workout"". Lather, rinse, repeat. It will not let me escape the page. It has been a week, I have tried resetting my phone, to no avail, and at this point, I guess it's time to try a new app!",1.0
Marsha Seekins,Non_Functional,This has been a great app. Now it is buggy. It keeps flipping to a screen that says save workout (even when I am not working out). I try to arrow back and it asks if I am sure and I say yes. It pops back for a second then back to save workout. It's no possible to use the app at all with this going on. I tried the update and reinstall. Pitiful.,1.0
John Krueger,Non_Functional,"Been using the free version for several years. Used to work great, but seems to get worse with every ""upgrade"".

Not worth messing with anymore; I'm going to try something else.",1.0
Karyn Charmley,Non_Functional,"This would be 5 stars if it was dependable. Every other walk, it stops logging distance at .04 miles. I like that it syncs with my Fitbit. I like the social aspect so I can have healthy competition with friends. I like the live updates along my walk for distance and pace. I detest that it fails to log my walk 50% of the time. I've uninstalled it, but the only thing that helps is clearing cache and data for the app. What a pain.",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Was a great app until last update. Went from accurate tracking to worthless tracking. I walk the same paths daily and am now getting under reported results. The mapping doesn't even display the rout accurately. Voice prompts are no longer on the mile intervals and the split times are really goofy. Calories burned are no longer accurate. About all it's good for now is tracking overall time and a date. Very dissapointing. Update: Switched to backup phone and unreliable results about the same.,1.0
Jadis Jones,Non_Functional,"Loved this app because it didn't run in the background and drain my battery. Counts distance, steps, total time, avg mile time, shows a map of where you worked out and you can save each workout for comparison. Only issue I had noticed is that it didn't always start to clock/measure my workout until I was into it for a few tenths of a mile. UPDATE - continued to start and stop counting steps and tracking mileage and became useless. Uninstalled.",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Not reliable - I've been using this app for almost a year and this is the third time it's just decided not to sync with my samsung watch.

A week now the watch says synced, nothing shows in the app. When it decides to work it's fine, but the intermittent failure to sync is unacceptable.",1.0
Elaine Neff,Non_Functional,"If i could give zero stars, I would. I have used this app for years. For walking, running, cycling. It worked great. I Ioved it. For the past year it has been glitchy.

I waited a year, hoping they would fix the problem. Today I gave up and Uninstalled for good. Downloaded a different app.",1.0
Karen Bolwin,Non_Functional,Use to be great. Since the most recent update it takes forever to load. I use to be able to view my challenges (what few are actually offered) and now it reads error.

Peter H. Smith,Non_Functional,"I used this regularly. Then the advertisements started getting invasive. This app requires LTE access. When they started ambushing me with video that has the sound on by default, my reaction was not, ""Gee, this is really annoying. I don't like the invasive sounds, and I'm to cheap to buy unlimited LTE. I think I'll pay to get rid of these obnoxious ads."" Instead, my reaction was, ""Time to uninstall this otherwise useful app."" --- Old review (Thanks for fixing it! Ad attacks! Oh well...) Worked great, and then it didn't....

I don't need bells and whistles, just distance:/ I know...submit a support ticket, blah, blah, blah....",1.0
Rudy Penza,Non_Functional,Started out a good app but the last two updates have completely screwed it up. Doesn't save workouts or makes you wait to start a new workout to save the old one and the music integration is sketchy. Why can't people just leave their damn app alone. In the end they all render their apps useless with the constant need to update. Some things don't need improving. This was one. Probably going to find a new app and dump this one.,1.0
Melody Glogowski,Non_Functional,"Not accurate. I have been using this app for quite awhile now, thought it was great. Put it on my husband's phone, we both started at exact same time, walked exact same route. His showed 8.03 miles, mine showed 7.3. Time was different. Mine 19mph. His 16mph and times were off by 5 mins. Not happy with this at all. Going to find a different app. 5/21/20 Tried experiment app on both phones again, same results. Mine was one mile shorter than on husband's phone, same route same pace.",1.0
Caroline Davies,Non_Functional,I have used the app for over 10 years and very happy with it. After a couple of small issues I reached out for assistance and was advised to uninstall and reinstall the app. When I tried to reinstall I was unable to as the app now states it is no longer compatible. I would have been quite happy to continue with the app as overall I was happy with just a couple of 'blips' I requested help installing an older version and was told it could not be done.

Mary Carol Sears,Non_Functional,"I used to love this app. Now it has been changed and I'm trying my hardest to cancel it.

Meanwhile I get flooded with a bunch of fitness statistics about which I could care less. I want a MAP. The ""help"" section on the website is worse than useless. It only offers robotic canned answers which do not fit my questions. Now -- surprise, surprise! -- I cannot find out how to cancel my annual payment! I feel ripped off as well as frustrated. It's a shame, because I had really appreciated the previous version of the app.",1.0
Trees,Non_Functional,"The last 2 updates have made it slow and difficult to 'save', before these updates there was a 'save' in the top right corner, press that once and it would save, perfect. Now, the update needs multiple presses on the blue save area, takes ages, and this last update is even worse. All I want when I finish, is to finish, not keep interacting with it to finish. I am patient and will wait for a fix on this, but if the next update is not an improvement, I won't be using it anymore.",1.0

Sheila kelman,Non_Functional,"I am so disappointed with this app. I first used it to collate all my workouts, with good results, for over 4 years but changed to Endomondo when I started having problems. I liked the accuracy, simplicity of access to stats and layout of Endomondo. I have now been forced back to Mapmywalk, but despite following all the troubleshooting instructions, it is totally unreliable in tracking my walks. Not having auto pause means having to remember to manually stop and start. Bring back Endomondo!!",1.0
Marko Pranjic,Non_Functional,"Doesn't function properly at all. I've installed the app on two different phones, turned on GPS and started walking. After about half an hour and 2.5 kilometres, the app reported that we only passed 320 meters! At first I thought it could be due to bad signal, but other services such as navigation seemed to work okay. We gave it another chance and started a new workout, but this time with a simple pedometer app also running. Map My Walk reported, again, only 700 meters after 1h walk. Meanwhile, the simple pedometer reported correct distance.",1.0
Gary Jannetts,Non_Functional,Great until last update. Now the app I used to use daily won't record the distance of my activity so basically it is a waste of my time to use anyone. Otherwise I would have given the app a great review and possibly 5 stars. This has now happened again!!,1.0
Jase Maddox,Non_Functional,"This app was amazing when I first started using it, then after a couple of months I lost the ability to share my workout with friends, so I had to screen shot and send which was annoying, but I perceived, now this week its become unbearable!!!! Its started to stop tracking me halfway through my walk, even though I have normal GPS and data on, and it decides when I'm finished.

But says no distance travelled. Checked the map at several points of my walk, it didn't update since I set out.",1.0
Christian Horner,Non_Functional,This app has got worse. It's no longer accurate. I've been using mapmywalk and mapmyrun for years since they purchased and rebranded the Endomondo app. I've also been walking the same handful of routes for years so I know the distance and the pace. Unfortunately mapmywalk is now calculating distance approx 10% under and therefore pace is inaccurate also. I've recently used the Google fit app concurrently and this shows the approx 10% error from mapmywalk. I've also used different phones.,1.0
Joseph Cormier,Non_Functional,"Okay now I have the paid app and I will not be paying for a second year. This app for my Apple devices is completely different and is far more polished then the one for my Android phone, it is truly a second rate app compared with the features for my Apple devices. On top of that I cannot get it so sync sometimes a for several days, I need the data when I get home not days later. Now yesterday I did a long 32 km's (20 miles) and it did not record the last 12 km's where all the hills are so now I have no idea of my elevations gains for the walk as well as the time it takes in that heat, It was 41 C. (106 F) and it ruined the data that I cannot easily replicate, I went out specifically so I knew my times in the those conditions, I will not be renewing, Not acceptable. I was willing to put up with many of these short falls but not fully recording my data is what has made me finally hate this app.",1.0

A Google user,Non_Functional,"I have been using Map My Walk for several years to map my walks, hikes, bikes and skis and have always been very happy with it, the map it generates and its accuracy. In the last two months and since switching phones from a Samsung S7 to a Samsung A50 the Map my Walk has been randomly turning off the tracking in the middle of walks. It continues to record the time but it just stops mapping the distance and then just gives me a straight line from where it stopped mapping to the end of my walk.",1.0
Zieneth Starr,Non_Functional,"I've tried this on 2 different watches with the same results. In order to pause the trip and finish, you have to swipe down from the top of the watch face - which on galaxy watches is how you get watch shortcuts also. A terrible design conflict with WearOS. Was really hoping this would be fixed on the last update. Nope. I still have to grab my phone.",1.0
David A,Non_Functional,"I used to use it all the time, but each new version was worse than the last. Today I go for a six hour walk, perfect reception the whole time, and though the timer keeps running half way through it just erased the first half of the walk. And when I get home it thinks the second half was me flying apparently. Utterly useless. Also burned fully half my battery while it failed to record.",1.0

A Google user,Non_Functional,"something has gone wrong with this app. I loved using it until Monday when it totally stopped working, all I get is the pink screen. Have even uninstalled it and reinstalled without success. Noticed the memory space is showing as a massive 254mb as apposed to the 58mg listed. ive been using it for a couple of years now and it was perfect for me. Hopefully they can get it sorted. would happily reinstall if it was fixed",1.0
Graham Taylor,Non_Functional,"I've used this app for three days, and something has gone wrong every time. Day 1 the app stopped recording my walk half way through. Day 2 the map suddenly reset part way, and then showed me walking in a straight line through buildings instead of on the street! Have I got the setup wrong, or is it the app? . . . . Day 3 - same as Day 1/2. It stopped recording on the map half way through my walk, and it showed me walking through the middle of buildings rather than on the pavement. So, I'm giving up on this app . . . no use at all!",1.0
Sergey Bazak,Non_Functional,"I switched to this app from ""Endomondo"", which I have been using for walking since 2012. I really miss the auto stop feature. It would also be nice to add the ability to select the average speed (km/h) instead of pace (min/km) on the main screen and in the statistics. Mostly I walk with the dog and tried to choose a ""Dog Walk"" instead of a ""Walk"", but did not understand the difference. In general, the score is somewhere 4-. the ""Endomondo"" was easier and BETTER.",1.0
Ahmed Kassem,Non_Functional,"Trying to fulfill the goal of distance in your app, but your app doesn't catch the GPS signal, only before reaching home in few minutes, it gets it. That’s ridiculous",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"After using this for a couple of years it suddenly stopped working on my other device.

Not impressed.",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"It doesn't track AT ALL my walk or anything. The map is completely nonsense, and keeps on drawing a random route when my GPS is really precise as I have a new phone. When Google Maps is telling me real time where I am, this app here goes crazy. The common sense tells me I do not climb walls and go through the buildings as the map says, drawing perfect straight lines. Waste of time.",1.0
OST Factory,Non_Functional,"Very clunky app, what is the use of advanced features when even the basic ones don't work smoothly. The biggest issue is the splash screen, sometimes while resuming a workout if you minimize the app, be prepared to stare at the splash screen upon maximization for upto an hour!! And this is one a One plus with 8 gigs of ram, other issues include app randomly getting killed even in foreground, app suddenly deciding to stop measuring distance traveled but continue to keep tracking time! Uninstall",1.0
Laura Crawford,Non_Functional,"Used to be a good app until the distance and route tracking failed. Zero help from ""customer service"" who told me to Uninstall and reinstall. Then to turn my phone off and back on every time I wanted to use the app. Then they closed the ticket saying it was resolved. Not. So sad- it used to track my path and I could rely on it if I was hiking and went off trail. Very glad I already use multiple apps to track my walks and hikes. Taking off the second star as this app still does not map my walk.",1.0
John PAUL Graham,Non_Functional,It was 5 stars. It hasn't recorded my last couple of walking routes properly. I did a walk a while back where I ended up going up the side of a cliff face. It lost gps location. Went out yesterday to walk around the housing estate and same thing happened. There were a few trees about but surely that wouldn't be enough to lose gps location!!!!!,1.0
Lāsma Helviga-Budriķe,Non_Functional,"GPS is terrible. E. g., walked 2,5 km, but app only counted 0,5 km, simply connecting farthest points in a straight line, and missing part of route. Once ran along with Endomondo (E) - on it path was corresponding to the real one, also E app can be faster opened and operated. On this one yet did not find option for automatic pause; GPS fail doesn't motivate to use it.",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,Keep crashing and can't open app tried to reboot phone and app picks up right where off and crashes. Can't open to stop my tracking and save. Find another app. I do the same walk just bout every day and it tells me the miles but I could be .1 miles from the spot it said yesterday. Not accurate. Was good enough though when it work as a baseline but now just useless,1.0
Shannon Kirkwood,Non_Functional,"WAS great, emphasis on WAS. It used to sync with MyFitnessPal and added exercise to daily data. Then it just quit. Uninstaller both, reinstalled, shut down phone, all other suggestions and nothing. You'd think they'd fix this bug before we all get competitors apps. That's where I'm going now. So UTTERLY disappointing from Under Armour, given the prices for their products! Going back to Nike products.",1.0
Sue Fisher,Non_Functional,What happened? I have been using this app for ages witj no problems it's perfect for what I need it for. Now all of a sudden when you finish a walk and the stats are being loaded it crashes my battery. From 60% charges to 30% in less than 30 second and I can watch the battery drop. As an app it's great just don't save if you don't have a charger to hand. Anyone else have this?,1.0
M H,Non_Functional,"This app has the potential to be amazing, but it glitches so often, that I hardly ever get a correct reading. The app disconnects from location if the screen is not always on, and in bad weather it's not always possible to keep checking and double checking that it's tracking the correct path.",1.0
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Poor. Although this app initially appeared to function reasonably well, this is no longer the case. In recent weeks. Having set up the app to measure a particular walk, I discovered that if I stopped anywhere on the walk the app would pause, but would not resume, leaving a false understated reading. Have now uninstalled the app.",1.0
PK inPDX,Non_Functional,"Before the latest update it would have been 4-5 stars, but now it's no longer a good app for exercise. Why did Map My Walk remove the feature to PAUSE while on locked screen? Removing this feature is archaic. Now, when I need to pause the app during a run, I have to reopen my phone with passcode and locate the app to pause. And in order to resume my activity I have to do the same, unlock phone, locate app, resume. Removing this feature was a mistake, as it was my favorite thing about the app.",1.0
