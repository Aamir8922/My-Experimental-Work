Jody Malsbury,Functional,I used to love the app and don't mind ads (ugh) if they keep the app free. But for the last week both the GPS and distance have been acting screwy. 2 weeks now. GPS signal is strong and app is in foreground; my use has not changed in the way I've been using it in the past 9 months. Same routes I've been walking for 7 months are showing weirdly different results.,system requirement,1,"Apologize again. Our team carefully reviewed your email and confirmed that your GPS coordinates are changing normally without any significant sudden shifts. Currently, we obtain data through the GPS on your mobile phone system, and the latest version has not made any changes to the relevant settings. Please grant accurate location permissions.",
Stephen A. Vrismo,Functional,"Once again, this app has failed. Most recently, it showed no movement from my starting point, and yet the final report showed that I'd moved over one mile. In reality, the route was actually less than half of that. I've had other frustrating experiences, but they're all basically the same. It doesn't always track my movement (GPS feature). It either over-counts my movement or under-counts it. When it does that it is wildly inaccurate. By comparison Google Maps accurately maps my walking route.",system requirement,1,"Hi Steve, sorry for the inconvenience.

Jane Font,Functional,"This app used to be good, but now you're bombarded with ads. I've always used the GPS tracking feature, but now whenever I turn it on, it automatically give me some random amount of distance before I've even taken a step anywhere from 0.01 mi to 0.25 mi. It's really frustrating and I'm don't trust that any of the info is accurate now.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,"Hello Jane, sorry for the inconvenience. It is related to the strength of your phone's GPS signal. We will continue to optimize this in future versions and hope to bring you a better experience. Our app is completely free for all users, so we need to display ads to earn some meager profits. Thanks for your understanding.",
Michael StÃ¥hl,Functional,Training function miscalculate both steps and distance making them 5 times larger. It should at least verify the measurement with the normal step counter. Also it's impossible to access the GPS route after you have saved the training session. Edit: Keeping the app in the foreground makes it pointless since the user would also listen to music and such at the same time. You need to instead improve it to handle working from the background. And GPS coverage was good in the middle of the metropolis.,FunctionalCapabilities,1,"Hi Michael, sorry for the inconvenience.

Sue Chadwick,Functional,"Never previously had a problem and I only use as a simple step and distance counter. Haven't checked for a few weeks until today. I can see there have been changes. I'm not sure how I need to use it now. I never did anything but carry it around with me before but it's now useless for me. It recorded 101 steps in one direction but by the return it had recorded just under 3k; both wildly under reported. I'm carrying the phone exactly as I've always done. Time to find another app, I think.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,"Hi Sue, sorry for the inconvenience. It may be due to the system limitation.

Mike Carroll,Functional,I've used this app last year and was great. Now for this multi-day hike. It is off my 2 - 3 hours and Kms off by 6- 10. I use 3 other apps they all work.

peter flanagan,Functional,"Used to be a really good, reliable app. Now it's wrong on distance every time, and often on route and/or GPS. Totally useless if distance is more important to you than total steps. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times to no avail. Uninstalling for good now. Updated 22nd May '23.....

EML,Functional,"Useless for either step or GPS tracking. On one route I take it has shown 11.11, 10.71, 10.85, and 10.91 miles, with 21886, 27413, 29311, and 35322 steps respectively. The main problem is that there's no filtering at all on the GPS signal, so it overestimates distance, and also shows you moving when you're stationary. I paused it yesterday, stopped for 20 minutes, and when it restarted it said that I had gone 1.2 miles since pausing. There are several more more minor problems.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Rob Rolls,Functional,"ZERO STARS, and if I could give less than zero stars, I would. - AVOID THIS APP - Distances are wildly inaccurate, steps counted are wrong, the audio keeps working even if you turn disable it and turn off your device speakers, and when you close the app, it restarts itself (Force Stop in Settings kills it). Nothing works properly and after a year reporting the problems then giving it another chance, I give up. They've fixed nothing and it isn't worth it's free price.

Bharat Shah,Functional,"This app is unreliable; It is absolutely untrustworthy since it stops working abruptly. Initially it worked well, but then it started behaving erratically. I have noticed that the app counts each step accurately if I keep the phone unlocked in front of me in hand (like reading something,) but it sleeps if I lock and keep it in the back pocket. There are times when it works extremely well no matter in whichever pocket I keep it. In short, you cannot rely on this app.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,"Hi, sorry for the inconvenience.

Kenny Dellinger,Functional,"This app is horrible! It shows you the ranking of others steps and shows you where you're ranked. Problem is, every morning by 8am, it shows that multiple people have put in 40,000-80,000 steps! There is no way that somebody has walked or jogged 20-40 miles by 8am, and it's multiple! It used to be accurate, but all the sudden started showing extremely high counts for people.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,

UPDATE: after 2 years I reinstalled because I thought it must be sorted by now. Nope: 5mins after you start a robot voice will tell you how proud of you they are 'because you're developing healthy habits'. Might work for some but I find it to be patronising guff.

Other than carrying it in front of your face you don't know when it has paused. I just did a verified 6.2 mile walk and it registered 1.27 miles. I resumed it several times or it would still be at 0.

A Google user,Functional,Dtay away from this app! The app never turned off even when I would tell it to even when I would manually shut it off it would just turn itself back on sometime during the night. There was no way to stop notifications either. I would turn notifications off it would turn themselves back on. As soon as I downloaded this app I started having all kinds of malware issues and my phone started acting as if it was bugged.,system requirement,1,,

Hugh James,Functional,"Worked well and was quite accurate when measured against Garmin Vivofit. A problem has developed if I use GPS and pause it then a few minutes later when I resume extra miles have been added. The other day I paused the app when going indoors for 10 minutes and only moved a few yards, instead of restarting at 5 miles it showed 8 miles, I had not done 3 miles indoors in 10 minutes.

Daniela Duerksen,Functional,"On random days the steps are not counted at all. Used this app 7 days, and 2 of those days it didn't count even after going for a 8k+ step walk. After restarting my phone entirely it started to count my steps.

Gary Wooding,Functional,"Installed easily and runs well on my Moto G5. But I would like to have a method of turning the audio off when I want quietness. I discovered a nasty problem when I tried to finish a training session last evening - an advert covered the entire screen!. When I tried to get rid of the advert in order to pause the program it switched me to the desktop where I had to invoke the app again. All in all, it took about 30 seconds to to reach the point where I could pause the app to get my time. Since the primary purpose of the ap is to record and TIME a training session, an unwanted advert that prevents recording an accurate time is a serious problem and needs to be fixed.

Otherwise, without internet, it just sums up the number of your steps and then multiply them with the length of your step and this, in turn, is automatically calculated based on your height (providing you entered it). So, this is pretty inaccurate since your step can vary. It can be shorter when you are tired and drag your feet, and longer when you walk vigorously. I compared this app with Map My Walk.

Javier Carranza,Functional,"The app has a good idea behind. Although it does it job and keeps you updated in calories and exercise, it has shortcomings. Technically, it fails in the counting of steps not only when you are not actually exercising but also in calibrating after pauses of not using the phone. When the mobile is left without much movement for a day or so, if you try to resume exercise it has issues to begin the counting of steps and underestimates 90% of your exercise.

Also it doesn't guilt trip you if you don't exercise every day, or try and make you do more. Only downside is that it can turn itself off when I go out unless I check that it's still on and recording my steps.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Brian Silva,Functional,"So far good. Interface is clean and well laid out. My only suggestion to the developer would be to be able to input the stride of your walk in foot measurements as oppose to low, medium or high. Other than that, great app!",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Steve Utermahlen,Functional,The app works well. It provides me with essential info and current updates when reachinga goals. It has ads but what do you want from s free app. It does have a glitch when starting out like adding a few unearned steps but I delete them right away to get a more accurate count.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Hi Steve, glad to hear from you. Thanks for using our app and rating. Our app is totally free, so would you give us a 5-stars rating as a reward, my friend? â",
Amanda Clarke,Functional,"I have using this for the last 2 months and have found it really good. I like the achievements and that you can set your own goals, this keeps me motivated. The last 2 days the km having been calculating properly so just did an update so hopefully this will fix this glitch",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Qing Cao,Functional,Pro: Simple interface. Easy to navigate. Highly recommended for beginner walker or jogger like me. Con: No issues with GPS for the first few days then suddenly the GPS tracking stopped working. Still do the job though. Give 4 star because of the GPS issue.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Abigail Carroll,Functional,"I love this app but I am a little bit upset. I just got a new phone and since there was no way to save my previous progress, I have lost it all.

Ed Short,Functional,"Like that you can turn it on and off, pause it. When you pause it, the background turns black, making it very difficult to read in sunlight. Works well for measuring distances, and creating walking routes.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Jyoti patel,Functional,"Great going,Our running is low, so it reminds us that we have to walk even more. We try to achieve something full. When we wake up in the morning, we do not use mobile, so our exercise and walking reading is not there, that is the fault, the rest of the app does excellent work.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Oxeye,Functional,"This was a pretty good app at one time, but now it just wears you out with ads and questionnaires. - I added a star because I still use the app and LFG responded to my review. The problem is that developers naturally want to monetize so every attempt to usually just makes the app worse. I feel their frustration but the bottom line is that with every tweak to wring some cash out of the thing, it further degrades it's usefulness.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Hi Oxeye, I'm sorry that our rating request disturbs you. We will try to adjust our strategy of rating invitation. This app is completely free for all users, so we need to display ads to earn some meager profits.
Thank you for understanding.",
A Google user,Functional,"Installed in conjunction with Map Tracker(strange this doesn't show in installed apps? May have installed it from within the app.) and accurately plots walks. Pedometer seems pretty accurate but distance covered widely out. Calculated length of step to use and increased sensitivity. Step length now 2' 10"". Should be over 7' tall. Haha! I've tried other trackers but this is the best. Found where to put personal details. Bltooth h/phs on and didn't burn too much battery. So good I've bought it",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"""Sorry for the inconvenience.

A Google user,Functional,Like the app. Seems very accurate. Will uninstall though if I can't find a way to turn off the verbal updates. Even with the phone sound off this app's audio still activates which is embarrassing at times.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
James Noonan,Functional,Really like the app design and functions. It computes steps very accurately for me. Computes a calorie burn which seems reliable too. The GPS distances were a off a good bit. Covered a known distance of 3.92 miles and Step Tracker only counted 3.45 miles.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Lynne Shaw,Functional,"I love the simplicity... But recently the tracking of the route or the distance has been way off. I've sent reports from within the app, and updated yesterday hoping that might fix things, but it hasn't.

Data points may be lost due to weak GPS signal or system permission restrictions.

Scott Harlow,Functional,I lmost maxed out all of the achievements and totaled over 1200 miles in 4 months. Now the GPS has stopped working and the walking trail has gone haywire.

Zakiyah Hyman,Functional,I like it it's great it's just it sometimes doesn't actually count the step,FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Hi Zakiyah, sorry for the inconvenience. We fully understand your feelings. This app uses the built-in sensor in the phone to count steps, but the sensor of different devices differs. We will continue to work hard to improve the algorithm. Hope to bring you a better experience.",
Mike Pro,Functional,This app is really good my only complaint is that the fasting portion of the diet plan has no countdown clock it just says the amount of time you have to fast and the eating window it would be alot better as a motivator and more intuative of an app to see how far you have come as opposed to having to keep up with it on your own.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Mitchell Sanchez,Functional,I like it never realized how much I walked quite amazing when you don't have a car. Only thing that I wish you had was a meditation type of workout as well to add to the cool things they already has with it I really do love this app not too many ads and it's really cool.,New feature,4,"Hi Mitchell, thank you for providing your valuable feedback.

Marcia Wilson,Functional,"It's a good app. Only thing I've to criticize is: the associated GPS tracking accuracy is laughable. But then that has been in my other uses too, so I'm not shocked. It puts me places in my 2-acre yard I haven't been in days. GPS has, in the past also located my house in the middle of the highway, wrong side of it, and (before I corrected it) twenty miles east of its true site. Go (re)figure!",system requirement,4,,

Landyn Parkin,Functional,It's a good app. It doesn't always count all of your steps. I would prefer a watch because it stays in place. It's good for taking a walk or run. It's not for playing sports because it's heavy and will fall out of your pocket. But overall I give it a 4 star because it doesn't count all of your steps,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,

Jeff Frank,Functional,"Very good for tracking miles walked. I use it at work and play...it's easy to use and not a bother. It let's me know when I have reached a goal walking and sets new goals , for me great app............ the review is kinda long wanting 500 words to explain how good it is they need to cut it back like 200 words. Or they can just let you put words in to get past this and go on to ratings and back to your phone. I hope they correct it and make it simpler for us. I tried to think of everything bye",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Andria K,Functional,This is an awesome step tracker. If your just curious how many you walk on a regular basis or if you need a little push to start moving. It really works for everyone. I really enjoy the option to compete with people near you. That definitely gives an edge for wanting to do better. And I really enjoy the drink more water reminder. That's just fun!,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
CLINT MCCLELLAND,Functional,"Only used for a couple of days but impressed so far. I walked over 3 miles yesterday and confirmed with Google maps the distance and periodically checked the step recording accuracy. I am an engineer that has precisely measured my average stride length and results lined up well and met expectations. The ad experience has been minimal so far with the free version. That said, I typically upgrade to ""ad free"" in most apps if the free version performs well.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Rick G,Functional,"Exceeds my expectations. I use it to track walks & hikes for time, distance, steps, calories, activity history and achievement of goals. Really like the (optional) voice feedback which provides occasional status reports (time, distance, calories, pace, progress toward goals) via my Bluetooth wireless headphones while listening to music. Paid the one-time $2.99 to get rid of ads and it's worth it. All around great app. Highly recommend.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
down2two Liketoknow,Functional,I started walking for my health and this has been really nice it has the GPS function. I can track the mileage from one point and then restart and to another point. It's very nice. Very helpful it also lets you put in your personality data like your weight so it can also do some calorie calculating. It also keeps track of how fast you walk. I highly recommend this app for anybody who's walking for their health.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
William Wilkerson,Functional,"Simplest to use of all, and coincidentally, it has the best combo of features, all in the simplest to use interface to use compared to other competitors that I've tested... Unfortunately, the competition has noticed, as I watch in real-time as both the similar existing apps seemingly become more like Step Tracker by copying every aspect of this app with every revision, masquerading these changes as merely ""updates"" -- while new apps just shamelessly copy, thankfully failing at every step...!!!!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Cozy Castle,Functional,"It's the best app I have on my phone. I'm not just saying that, it's truly a daily motivator for me. The app achievements section is great but could be expanded and different sign in options instead of just Facebook for the ranking system would be great.

Nickolas McAnally,Functional,"This app has been great for keeping track of progress, it is encouraging with the badges, and the GPS is better than any other tracking app I've had, and I went through about six others.

Laura McCullum,Functional,"Awesome at keeping track of your movements whether walking or in the car.... It has one little lag in it... when it starts to keep track of steps you might think it's not working cause it doesn't count right away... but not long after you start it, it will catch up the steps and you'll be able to watch 1 step at a time counted by the app...

Robert Lee Raimondi,Functional,So far it's been really great. I've been wanting to get a step counter and a fitness device for my wrist but in the meantime I'm using this app and I will probably continue to use it after I get the wrist or wearable device.

There are some ads but they're not very intrusive and they don't seem to be causing a negative experience,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Larry Bogan,Functional,Super simple and fun! I've only used it once but I like it already!

The optional GPS tracking is great to calculate average step length for walking or running too. I'd love to see a couple of additions, or perhaps I'm missing something. 1: It would be great to see total distance and calories since installing. 2: Sometimes I get a notification ""New Record Created!"" and when I select it, the app only shows me my step count for the day.

The exercise mode is really motivating and encourages me to take a longer route to work, etc to meet my goals. Good that it tells you how many calories you've burned as well. It does seem to accurately record all my steps too unlike other apps I've used that are less responsive.

You can alter the sensitivity mode and I did several tests to see if the counter is accurate. So far, so excellent = game changer for this Grandma! â™¥ï¸",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
N Maser,Functional,"I've been using it for a week. Seems accurate. Calculates stride distance based on height and weight, but can be input manually. Manually input your daily step goal.

Lynn Walsh,Functional,"I normally use a pedometer to track how many steps I've completed whilst walking the dog. So today I downloaded this app and had it playing in the background whilst listening to music during my walk. Every 10 mins it overrides the music to give me a verbal notification of how far I've walked, how many calories I've burned and the speed I'm doing per mile. Although it doesn't take into account when I'm walking uphill (extra calories would be burned) I still found it a great motivator to do more!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Hi Lynn, thanks for your feedback.

Jill Killian,Functional,"So far, so good! I had checked to see if different movements would count and they do not. It keeps pretty accurate read of steps taken.

Thank you for the help to a healthier lifestyle.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Metalguts,Functional,"Simple, easy and offline! Downloaded the app and then took a 7k walk. Worked perfectly! I like the fact that it will give you an approximate distance walked, even if the GPS is off. It would be nice if the app always auto updated the step count instead of sometimes waiting for me to unlock the screen.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Henry Fu,Functional,"1. The 'audio' that tracks on progress helps motivate users to achieve their goal. Perhaps, with more frequent trainer's 'words-of-encouragenent', it creates better interactivities. 2. The live GPS to track/record walking routes is like 'proof of achievement' when shared with others. Kudos.... thank you!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

Great app so far.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Serina Goodman,Functional,"You have officially lost a user. The last update has made a huge error in keeping track of the distance accurately. It jumps all over the place, too far in distance in a short period of time then jumps back to starting your distance when you've been at it for 20 mins.

spynylcracka,Functional,"The app is completely broken now. I have been using fit for over five years and everything worked except for the step counter which was way off. I used the app mainly to track distance, pace, miles, heart points and elevation. Now nothing is working correctly after the October update.

It will even start subtracting distance, I don't understand how this is even possible.",system requirement,1,,
Jennea V,Functional,"Keeps freezing. So frustrating. Also doesn't track walks on its own anymore, so have to go in deeper to see how many steps I took on my walk and total them myself. Every pause on my walk seems to think it needs to stop and restart tracking. It used to say ""morning walk"" and track the whole walk not stop tracking for every 2 seconds pause I take. Update 11/6/23: still freezing and not tracking steps or anything, just spinning wheel of death. Fix it.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Vassilios Gerousis,Functional,Latest version seems to be totally wrong on estimating activity metrics based on exercises. It stopped adding data metrics and then removed at the final results.

To the point where it feels hopeless to keep going to reach a goal because every time you get close, hundreds of steps disappear. I have no choice but to use this if I want to participate in the money back program through my insurance, but it's so awful that I may just give up on the program.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Mike Cebrian,Functional,"AVOID AVOID AVOID Since it was updated on July 20th, the app isn't accurately collecting data.

Kimberley Edwards,Functional,"I've used Google Fit as a step, workout, and heart point tracker for a couple years. In my experience, it had always been a bit frustrating, but after doing a factory reset on my phone, re-installing, and giving it every permission it requested, it's not working. It refuses to keep ""Track Activities"" and ""Use Location"" selected. I've uninstalled and re-installed. It was dodgy at best before.

Barak Nehoran,Functional,"Google Fit is the most bug-filled app I have ever seen Google produce. It has *serious* issues. There is a toggle for tracking my activity, but whenever I flip it, it immediately flips right back. What on earth? I tried contacting Google's customer support, but they couldn't help because they said that no one in customer support is familiar with Google Fit.

A Google user,Functional,"Don't upgrade. This redesign sucks when it comes to accuracy and pretty much everything else. It doesn't accurately measure steps anymore and always seems to be subtracting them and it hasn't imported my Withings scale data since Sept 17th. I haven't seen Sleep As Android sync correctly with this new version. The journal also doesn't match the data on the home dashboard, so that's totally not confusing. ðŸ™„ It's difficult to navigate if you're used to detailed information like the previous app version had, lord help me if I ever need to edit an automatically tracked activity in here from like bike to walk, it seems like it's going to be a giant headache. Finally, the heart points are stupid. This new paradigm is vague and confusing and maybe if it was used anywhere else it would be helpful but right now it feels like you earn these mysterious points for doing who knows what, and that's if the app even tracks it correctly. Then it chastises you for not meeting this goal of weird points and makes you lower it so you can feel extra bad about yourself. What would have been helpful are notifications that tell you when you've been sitting too long or haven't walked enough. Or maybe like meditation or breathing exercises.

It could really stand to go back to its old size.  Or at least be made adjustable.  The app itself only works part of the time.  Actually, I believe that it continues to count steps.  But the UI often freezes and will not update, so you can't see your progress.  When this happens I've tried force-closing the app and even cycling power on my device.  But I've found that the only way to wake it up is to go home and turn wifi on.  Then the UI will finally update.

A Google user,Functional,"The old google fit prior to the recent revamp was great.  It was reliable, easy to figure out, and tracked information I was interested in, such as changes of elevation on my walks.  Also looked nice.  The new version stinks.  It frequently won't start at all, it doesn't track my route consistently - sometimes the route it tracks looks like the GPS system is wobbling!  And sometimes it won't find me at all, though I'm starting from the same place every single day.  Lots of problems, including that it put my photo on the start page, which is NOT something I want and can't get rid of.  I don't like that kind of invasiveness.  PLEASE bring back the old Fit for those of us unhappy with the new one!  There is not one feature of the new that I want, and I do want features of the old one back.  Guess I have to ""edit"" this review rather than write a new one.  I've uninstalled Google Fit because it's not fit to be on my phone.  The latest problems include draining my battery by continuing to run in the background after I've turned it off, and NOT running to track my activity when I tell it to.

A Google user,Functional,"Google fit use to be a great app. With the big update earlier this year the app is now useless. I can go on a run using another app and it shows an accurate mileage while fit says I went half the distance. If I look at the map that fit provides it shows a path I did not take. The most frustrating part is the apps are set up to share data and they don't.  Edit: Setting my height and weight is not the solution.  Again I use another tracker when I run and it shows the correct path that I ran, fit shows a very odd path where i cut corner and miss complete parts of my run.  Yesterday I went for a 3.5 mile run and fit showed it as 1.2 miles.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,Hi Drew. We're sorry to hear that you are experiencing issues tracking your activities.

A Google user,Functional,The loss of features with the latest big update is inexcusable. We used to be able to *choose* what we wanted to set as our goals and what we cared most about in terms of our health. Now we are forced to use the move minutes nonsense. I am actively trying to *gain* weight and I don't care at all about steps and cardio. I care about strength workouts and calories. Now I'm trying to figure out what alternatives exist aside from Google for fitness tracking because it's become completely useless.,New feature,1,,
Cynthia Chou,Functional,"I really wanted to use this app to store all my health information. However it is not very friendly in regards to the menstrual tracking portions.

A Google user,Functional,"Horrible, can't track or edit steps from a previous day. Poor design. Can't opt out of the meaningless move minute circles.

Check out virtually EVERY OTHER fitness app to get a clue. You guys are Google!",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Elliander Eldridge,Functional,"This app has a major problem: There is absolutely no way to correct a typo. If you enter a bad data point for a body measurement you can enter a new value afterwards, but the old value will remain in history permanently. If you make the new data value for the same date and time it will show that as your current measurement, but it won't record it in history at all. The only way to fix a typo is to delete all history for that measurement, which is a bit like if Google made us delete entire documents to fix a typo on Google Sheets. You'd then have to go in and enter all the data points again manually for the entire history and hope you don't get another typo. If you need to clear the data again you will first have to clear data for the app in Android settings. If that's not bad enough you can't access the data from a web browser to save it so you will need to keep your data history recorded somewhere else to fix errors if and when they occur. A data entry app that doesn't let users fix typos is of limited usefulness. There's no way to report bugs and Google One support can only read you what is on a single help page which isn't much. Oh, and there's also no way to accurately record BMI. That requires a whole number, but my Doctor's office records to two decimal places. And for tracking steps, I counted my steps while holding the device and it did not record them properly. That said, if you don't care about storing accurate data, the app is great! Nice user interface. Although personally I'd prefer functionality over look and feel.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
A Google user,Functional,It appears there's a glitch in the software. I decided to install Google Fit and sync my watch app with it.

THEN... it got a big update and redesign.  Now, there are no maps, and half the features are gone.

At the end of the hike discovered the app stopped recording after I'd looked at the journal. BAD! I don't have any other gadgets that interface with this app; if you do, it may be a better fit for you. For me, I want to know distance and also elevation and a good map, etc. The strava app is great for this.

Wish I could go back to the previous version since it had some nice features and actually worked most of the time.   Got so frustrated I downloaded Samsung Health and that app works great. I have a Pixel phone, and its frustrating that the Google app works so poorly with the Google phone. Please fix it.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Mark Faine,Functional,"I like that it is free but that's about all of the pros. As for cons, you have to have your phone on you at all times unless you are linking a device, at which point you'd probably be using the device's app. How it's held/worn seems to change tracking accuracy. The step count is wildly inaccurate. The app under counts drastically on the treadmill and over counts a bit when walking on pavement. There is no way to modify the stride length or do any sort of calibration",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
A Google user,Functional,"Google failing once again. Breaking previously perfect functionality all for a UI redesign to copy Apple's. This app used to be very precise in tracking steps and distance.

Travis Mesologites,Functional,"This app needs a major design overhaul. It has the absolute basics and can only show the data, but not allow you to edit or delete incorrect entries that were imported (you can't even edit the dashboard).

The app tracks well but very hard to see good info in app. For example, still have not found a view for calories burned per day. Also, very clunky to switch days when viewing day stats.

It's very consistent about it. It's never matched anywhere near my actual step count. That's a bummer because my tracker is supposed to sync to Google, which will sync to my food tracker. Instead I'll just have to track things manually in the food app. Without that Fit is kinda useless. And yes, I left feedback through the app.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,

A Google user,Functional,"App mostly works (can be glitchy when you add activities manually) but you can't set/track normal goal metrics like distance or elevation.

You wonder why you even bother bringing them along.  The major disappointing sigh is in it's visual appeal... or lack thereof. Bundle up as this app is so stripped down that I found myself double checking the Play store to ensure I hadn't actually installed some 5th grader's unfinished summer camp app project. I easily waste 10 minutes every time I open the app, as I confidently morph into Sherlock, absolutely sure this will be the time I uncover some hidden area or setting that I have just somehow managed to overlook... over and over and over again.

I think I do like the idea of the Move Points and I like the workout (walk) tracking with the map and all, (although the map sometimes does not show my whole round trip), and I like being able to track other items (bp, weight, etc), but that's not enough for me to stay with this app.  Also the app will not let me enter heart rate; that part only works with a separate tracker device.  I'm giving 3 stars to give the app the benefit of the doubt, but I am removing the app from my phone.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"I had the app before the recent update with Google's new branding style and enjoyed it a lot then. I normally strength train and go running so it's a good app to compile all of my exercises in one place and you could go in and edit the details the app got wrong about your workout. Now that it's been updated, I can't go in to fix the milage or time of a run I tracked with the Nike Run app (you can connect apps to it to input other workouts automatically). Being able to connect related apps is a great feature because I can see all my workouts in one place still without having to manually do it all the time, but it doesn't get the details right. For example, if I go for a 1.5 mile run through my Nike Run app, it'll show up on Google as a 1.3 miles and the time/pace will be wrong because of it but with the way the Google app is now, you can't edit that information. Also, when I delete the workout, and try to add the activity to put in the correct details, the heart points/move minutes don't adjust and I hate that I can't put in the ""seconds"" as the smallest time measurement because improving and tracking my times are super important. Overall, this app would be fantastic, if it worked a little more like the previous version.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"Honestly, this updated app is rudimentary and has next to 0 customizability. The only thing it's decent for is giving a high level overview of activity. The only good thing about it is it's integration with other apps, which you will need in order to get ""credit"" for your actual exercise. You can't even add a personal goal, like ""workout 3 times a week"". Overall, very disappointing.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"3.5. I really like the concept of this app. However, after installing it I've found it pretty buggy - definitely not Google's usual standard.

I then tried to add my strength training as an activity, but it didn't even show up after I saved it. It also doesn't allow manual heart rate entry, and every activity only shows steps and distance for me - not ideal for recording lifts.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Joanne Locnikar,Functional,"When I first use it, everything tracks fine. After about 2 months, it doesn't map my walks correctly and doesn't keep track of pacing.

A Google user,Functional,"I LOVE using this app and have recommended it to countless people, however there has been a few occasions where the app doesn't track things properly. For example, after working out this morning and inputting the values, I check my phone a bit later and the values skyrocketed to over 100 move minutes and more than double that in heart points, and continued to add more and more all day at times when I wasn't doing anything. Also has done the opposite after working out, where the values dropped.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"I use this, but can't highly recommend.  First, the phone app often shows only the half the activity shown on my watch. Tried an uninstall, but that did not work. Today I tried unpairing, then re-pairing in hopes that this will take care of the problem. Secondly, the Fit watch face used to show the amount of steps right on the basic dial.  No longer.  No I have to click through twice to see the full amount of steps. It would be nice to see the steps on the basic face, then, if I want to see more info, click through to it.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Cyan YT,Functional,"It's not very informative at getting people into an active lifestyle, but is VERY good at being a ""Fitness tracker"" app. It seems to accurately count my steps when compared to a pedometer, can track heart rate and respiratory rate in-app as well.

Shellie R,Functional,"I like the look of the app and how it displays information. I like the journal aspect to see my walks each day. But the tracking is always way off. The steps are accurate (match my pedometer app), but the distance and minutes seem random most days. I've sent feedback through the app sooooo many times. It gets old sending feedback over and over for the same issue. Easier to just manually change it. This app can be used in conjunction with a more accurate app but isn't very useful alone.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"The app itself works pretty well. Pretty easy to add activities and weight. I like the widget for tracking how I'm doing. One major complaint: it's too hard to get a useful overview of my data. Mobile isn't the best form factor for that, so I would like to view it on my desktop.

A Google user,Functional,"Is it the greatest fitness tracking app? Answer, NO. But it's much better than the car wreck of an update Planet Fitness pushed out this past August, just look at their reviews, it's undeniable. At least I can track miles, minutes, and calories burned on this app. It could use improvements in the way it presents the data you enter by using bar graphs like Planet Fitness used to have on there app and solve the problems with interfacing with hardware and other apps as some complain about.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"Overall, I like the motivation the app provides. When I check my progress while on a walk I can see whether I'm on track to meet my goal. However, lately I've noticed my mileage and steps walked don't coincide. For example, today the app registered 9.8 miles but only approximately 11,000 steps. That would be just over 5 miles.

A Google user,Functional,"I  have used Google fit for two weeks now.  It leaves much to be desired.  Today I used it on a bike ride of 21 miles, for which it registered only 11.6 miles.  Another problem lies in the mapping of walks and rides.  If I sit for  just a few minutes, it seems to confuse the app, and it  drops part of the walk or ride either the first half or the second.  The mapping function also seems to easily drop a major part of the walk/ride.  I think the app needs more work.  Bryce Johnson",FunctionalCapabilities,3,Hi Bryce. Thanks for your review!

A Google user,Functional,"I admit I only downloaded this app for use with Pokemon go as it will not connect to the fitness tracker I currently prefer but first impressions are not so great. It's not intuitive really in the least. I had to dig for the settings menu, it set goals for me automatically that probably will be perfectly useless for me. I love Walking but I'm not going to go just because some app tells me too. Sorry. Also it snows 9 months out of the year where I am so I can't possibly walk every day because it simply isn't safe sometimes to walk in blizzards and 4 + feet of snow. I will give this app one month after I can connect it with go. If my impressions haven't improved by then and/or I find it useless in some way it's going bye bye again. Just so you know I love walking and use a simple app called pedometer pretty regularly. It's a wonderful app that tracks steps taken, distance walked, and calories burned among other things pretty accurately. It isn't very robust but it does exactly what I want and need it to and it does it well. Only downside is I have to turn it on and leave it active for about 5 mins for it to be accurate but it's easy on my phone for battery and processor so with Pokemon go it's amazing even if I can't sync the two. Sorry.",New feature,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"I really like the concept of move minutes and heart points, and how they automatically adjust based on your recent activity.  However, this concept does not work when move minutes and heart points aren't counted from aggregated activities from 3rd party apps.  Strava, for example, will create activities in the Journal, but you'll get zero points for it unless you manually override the activity with a new activity of your own.  I have heard that My Fitness Pal syncing is the same way.  I also cannot sync directly from a Suunto watch, so the amount of manual syncing that's required to make this useful is painful.  Also, the New Year Challenge is confusingly simple - there are milestones, but it's unclear what the actual goal is here or how you're doing in general.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Matt Crawford,Functional,"When it's working, it's fine. Not as full of features as other tracking apps and not a real replacement for the old ""my tracks"" app. As of a recent update, the numbers portion of the main display for heart points and steps has stopped updating.

Kevin,Functional,"3 stars â€¢ Impractical | The design of this app is great. It's nice and clean and has a dark mode!

A Google user,Functional,"I love that this app tracks ""move minutes"" and "" heart points"" to help you track activity levels, not just number of steps. I hate that it is incredibly inaccurate. It constantly drops steps; you open the app, it shows a step count, then updates and lowers that count - by hundreds of steps, sometimes over a thousand. I have a smartwatch, and the numbers on the watch's fit app never seem to match the app on my phone; and when they do sync, the app defaults to the lower number of steps (apparently). I've watched my step count drop on phone and watch over and over. It does not sync well with other fitness apps; they overwrite the Google fit data. If I track a bike ride on fit, and another app also picks up the activity, but doesn't track correctly (because I didn't set that app to track), the Google fit data is overwritten by the other app - which only picks up about a third of my ride. It they could fix these issues, it would be the best fitness app I've used, but at this point it's so unreliable that I need redundant apps in order to get anything close to accurate info.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,Hi Lisa.

Now everything is a laid out more complicatedly. They made finding the exercises easier by putting it alphabetically but that's about it. All in all I think the app got worse instead of better.

Gandelf,Functional,"It has some nice features. At least, they would be nice if the program would work. It only records workouts, steps, and heart points if it feels like it. Even when it does feel like it, it's extremely slow to pick up data from my primary device/app combo. It randomly forgets workouts that it has previously credited. (Yesterday, it went back and forth between crediting my afternoon walk or my evening workout--but never both.) The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 is that it is not my primary tracker so when it fails it's no more than irritating. I simply set what it calls goals and I call minimums to something low enough that I can still keep my streak even if it drops half what I do. When it doesn't randomly drop things, it counts steps pretty close to the same as my primary app, and I have the feeling that it counts calories used rather more accurately. The only thing I'd like to see different (other than working properly) is counting heart points on a rolling week instead of Monday to Sunday and then you start over.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,

Naren SS,Functional,"I've been using the app assuming it a standard on my Android, but Samsung health seems like it's becoming a better alternative (since it directly syncs with my watch etc). This app is lacking even simple features like allowing us to change the order of the widgets, etc. The graphs and visuals are nice, but overall features leave a lot to be desired, like syncing with other fit devices in the ecosystem, nudging me with reminders on how I can improve on things, etc",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We appreciate you sharing this with us, Naren.

A Google user,Functional,I only use it for pokemon go adventure sync as this is the only app that will sync on android devices. The app is messing up my distance. According to Google fit I took almost 11.5k steps and it is only counting 0.6 miles... My Fitbit tracked over 12k steps and is almost 3 miles. I tried to find a stride length setting to see if that accidentally got edited but I'm not finding an option for that. Not sure when it started messing up distance,FunctionalCapabilities,3,Hi Crystal. We're sorry to hear that you are experiencing issues tracking your activities.

Bhargava,Functional,"This app is good to track walking and running. After upgrading to android 11, it started measuring less half distance walked.

Brinna NiFiach,Functional,"Just as others describe, the map/distance tracking is abysmal. If I walk a 4-block square route, it shows most of a triangular route, which doesn't correlate with my route at all. I've sent feedback on this before, and it's just gotten worse. I'm surprised that a company that does mapping and geolocation and can sense how many mph I'm traveling doesn't use the GPS sensors more precisely to see the route I'm walking.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
vrwaterman,Functional,"when I first started using this app it was working pretty accurately but since a couple of months into it now the app tracking just makes a big zigzag on my walk cutting off half the turns and blocks that I've walked. when I get back I look at my walk on the fit app, it's totally different than what I walked. I haven't been able to figure out how to make it go back to being accurate again so it's really not useful",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hi there.

A Google user,Functional,"The Fit Workout is ambitious, however it needs maturing. I have the Fossil GEN 4 HR, with the standalone GPS.   It did rather well when I did a chest workout, and back workout. but when it comes to curls, it kept switching to Lunges at the end of the set.  The running portion is really great, however it does not have the option to set mile interval notifications. It would be nice to set 1/2 mile or mile alert either via vibrations, or audible alert via BT headphone.  If I take a new route I have to constantly look at my smartwatch to see when I've covered a mile.

Kirstin Crump,Functional,"Great app! I like the reminders it can give every certain distance or time. Heart points give me a good idea of what I've done. It does need some work. The way it counts and logs my heart points from tracked activities is inconsistent and inaccurate. An overall great app that I'm sure will continue to improve! Edit:I changed my review to 3 stars. The pace was calculating wrong. The distance sometimes, too. I've become increasingly frustrated with its navigation. I'll stick to other apps for now",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"i like this app, i just wish it had a few more features/options. primarily, i wish the option was there to add notes to specific days - or to add notes period. i dont have a device synced, but it does keep a very accurate record of all your walking/steps/distance. the heart/movement points could be explained a little better. overall, its good but could be better.",New feature,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"I like that this app is so closely integrated into the Android OS and that it works well with wearables such as Wear OS.

A Google user,Functional,"Could be better. This serves a basic function as an activity tracking app. However, the integration of heart points and move minutes can be confusing.

For added exercises I would recommend adding the typical amount of heart points and move minutes because in most cases that is impossible to know.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Tsalagi Yi,Functional,"If you dont have cell service, as in out of the country there are better apps for your exercise routines. This one shows all the roads on the map, but the exercise doesn't follow the roads or your route. Also, it tracks when not prompted resulting in many so called walks which are aggravating to delete. To delete them you have to delete them one at a time taking WAY too much time than you want to spend on something that should be simple.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"I really liked this app because it measured my overall activity, it tracks my time and gave active minute goals. I liked it a lot, especially during the shelter in, because I'm not walking far but I'm staying active. The update changed it to just another step counter. I hope the producers will consider allowing the app the track both and let the user choose which goal system is most useful themselves.",New feature,3,,
Dan Chan,Functional,"Fit is good at figuring out what activity is occurring automatically (walking, running, cycling). However, Fit undercounts the distances.

A Google user,Functional,"It was doing great until recently. starting March 16th, it hasn't been doing well with mileage when matching the steps. I would have done 2 miles worth of steps, for example, and although the step count is right, the mileage will say I've only done like 0.35 or something way less. So because of that, it's messing up with mileage for synced apps such as Lympo and Pokemon Go, and hurting the progress in those apps. Been trying to contact but haven't been able to, so leaving concern here.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Google user,Functional,"The app is reasonably good at differentiating between walking and bike riding. I'm not sure how accurate the step count is. Significant difference between this and Samsung's fitness tracker. As much as 20% more than Samsung. Small bug when I actually start a workout activity (bike ride) When I end the ride, the notification of an active ride is persistent and will not close. I have to force close the app. No data is lost, so just a minor pita.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Google user,Functional,This app initially works great but then after a month or less it will stop accurately counting my steps. I work 10 hour days on my feet (very physically active job) with only 20 minutes where I'm sitting in one place for lunch. When the counter works correctly it says I'm at about 14000 steps. But it must have an algorithm for steps recorded if it thinks you're getting too many because it suddenly drops to maybe 4000 steps per day until I reinstall it.

Tim Lehner,Functional,"It's OK. Does what it needs to do, mostly. One big problem is that part of my running route has poor GPS connection, so my daily 'loop' is always wrong, showing an interpolated path cutting through yards and homes, mis-estimating the distance. It needs is a 'snap-to-predefined-path', and/or a 'snap-to-roads', and/or 'edit path taken' options, so when GPS is lost, it assumes you followed the road or a predetermined path, rather than running through people's houses and yards.

A Google user,Functional,"It's ok! But something I'd like to suggest is to put a sleep tracker in the app. Sleep is very important to your overall health. This app is very basic considering it's a Google app. I also would like for the fitness tracker to take the phone it's connected to to be able to also track steps/mileage using GPS.

Adrian Cortes,Functional,"Used to be great now mediocre, I liked the ability to track move activity instead of steps. They should added the steps feature as an optional feature instead of replacing it as the main mode of tracking.

Chris Doehring,Functional,"I think the app has great intentions and with some trackers may integrate really well. I received my Mi Band 4 about 3 weeks ago and Google Fit sync'd with it not flawlessly but it was good. Fast forward, some steps aren't counted, to the tune of 300-400 a day. Syncing is sporadic and is rarely current when I check in on it. That said this is my first tracker since I trashed my fitbit. I had a model several years ago that you couldn't replace the band and it cost roughly 140ish. Swore I'd never go back to a company that did that. My Mi Band 4 is awesome. I've not seen ghost steps, does all the usual things, like that I can check weather immediately, locate my phone (If I don't have floors and walls interferrring too much), heartbeat etc. And at a fraction of what that fitbit cost. And it's global enough that I'd think Google Fit would better sync with it. I expect that Google Fit will catch up but that's not a sentiment I attribute to google.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Matt Clark,Functional,This app falls far short of the mark for anyone serious about exercise. There are many apps that track location very well and provide accurate distance and other stats using only GPS data. This app is not one of them. Distance and other data are so inaccurate it's absurd. Data such as elevation gain is missing. It feels like they coded this halfway and then just gave up. This app has so much potential yet it was all hurriedly tossed overboard. A significant disappointment from Google.,FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hey Matt, you can try turning off and on all permissions for automatic tracking on your Google Fit app after restarting your phone.

Amber Joy,Functional,"While I like the steps/HR data, and the walk mapping is really nice, the ""heart points"" are a frustrating mess! (Yes I used the in-app Developer contact.) They disappear for no reason, making it a useless metric. Sometimes they come back, but they don't stay. For example, mine went up to 15 or 16 yesterday, dropped down to 3 at the end of the night, went back up to 15 an hour or two later, now the next morning they dropped to 2 for that day!

In fact, when I view the workout history, I notice the calories for a historical workout record will continue to creep up throughout the day at what appears to be the pace of my metabolic rate.",Security Requirements,3,Hi Jon.

A Google user,Functional,Automatic tracking is not reliable. Sometimes it tracks me exercising but I'm just driving. Sometimes it doesn't pick up my exercising. It's just so frustrating. I wish they gave you a pop up question to see if you started exercising and then track the distance a little better. It does have other options to log your work outs and weight loss though.

Anne Malautea,Functional,"This app is good, but I've just come across a glitch. I use it to stay active and more often since I'm getting older. I really like the heart points feature because it holds me accountable. However, on Tuesday of this week, it showed my correct heart points at the beginning of the day, then by mid afternoon they were gone. I sent feedback to the app and shortly after, it was fixed. Now this morning they're gone again! This shouldn't be happening. Fix the bug, Google.

Alice Brinkmeier,Functional,"If you're not a health nut, then this will work for you. I use this app for very bare bones workout tracking & really can't complain. I don't wear any type of smart watch & I actually have the pedometer completely disabled on my phone. This is my 2nd year using it to track bike rides. I was happy that it still had all my rides from last year saved in the Journal section so I could use them to plan for this year. Occasionally all the workouts will disappear or the data will be off in the list view, but it has always reappeared or corrected itself without major intervention from me. The only thing I wish I could do is access this ap on my laptop the same way that you can so many other Google aps such as email, calendar, sheets, keep, etc.",New feature,3,"Hi Alice, weâ€™re always looking for ways to improve.

A Google user,Functional,"Generally does what it says. However, there is a huge difference in the steps that it logs vs what has been recorded on my day in my Garmin tracker. I have deleted and re-downloaded both apps to make the connection happen. I have followed the help options located on Google Fit.

A Google user,Functional,"I liked the Google Fit app before it had steps. I think move minutes is a lot more general and applies to all activities where as to steps is mainly just walking and running. Google, if you're reading this review, please try to make it optional to have steps instead of move minutes because I do understand some people like it better. But, I do not. It would be really great and more useful to me and people who don't walk a lot as an exercise to have the move minutes option instead.",New feature,3,Hi Sarah. We completely understand that not all users can take steps and we are committed to inclusiveness that comes with Move Minutes and Heart Points.

A Google user,Functional,"It was a 5 now a 3. It was working well for me just recording and presenting accurate and useful activity information until about a month or two ago when I was on vacation. The maps of my running and walking became much more inaccurate, running was recorded as walking, sometimes running was not recorded at all, and steps walking around the house or office were not always recording. For example, a morning walk to the end of the driveway to pick up the newspaper or to put out the recycling would not record. I thought that maybe the app was having trouble adjusting to vacation in LA when it was used to a routine in the NYC and the suburbs. The problem persisted when I came home. I am not using any other device such as a Fitbit to record my activity. I thought that my Pixel 2 was acting as my activity tracker to count steps, record move minutes, and to track my location, to estimate running distances. I have an activity tracker called Stridekick on my phone. I installed it when from when my workplace had a steps challenge. Maybe that app was feeding information to Fit and that connection has stopped working or is now creating a conflict. I thought that Fit gets its activity information directly from the phone's accelerometer and location tracking. Perhaps the phone itself is not recording activity correctly. I also use Digital Wellbeing, so perhaps there is a problem with the Fit's interaction with that Android feature. Problem solving information on the other two recent posts which is available within the app did not provide insights about solving these problems.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Michael,Functional,"I like the app but heart points don't always show and miles tracking has a bug. When I'm finished with tracking a bike ride it shows accurate miles but the next day they show incorrectly. Example: I rode 14.2 miles on Thursday, the next day the same ride shows 3.8 miles...

A Google user,Functional,Somedays this app is tracking my driving as walking and not tracking my morning walks at all...

Bria Sativa Aguayo,Functional,"Pretty solid and user friendly app. I like to be able to track BP and activity. They lost me at estimated calories burned a day (including at rest). It's totally bogus and not based on science. Everyone has a different metabolism, bone density, muscle/fat ratio, hydration, etc., etc. It's guaranteed inaccurate within hundreds of calories.

A Google user,Functional,"Three stars is generous. This app could be good, since it tracks important metrics such as blood pressure, weight and sleep as well as exercise. It can connect to my Tickr X for an accurate heart rate reading, which is good, but the problem is it's woefully inaccurate in tracking exercise.

A Google user,Functional,"This app has serious sync and tracking issues. It will track a 6km run as a 1km walk and only 60 steps recorded. This app in combination with Pokemon Go also has serious delay and lack of tracking. Overall this is a great concept, but seems to lack in actual usability at this time without a compatable wearable device. Maybe add a feature for Pokemon Go users who use this when the game is idle to track progress and hatch eggs. Even a generic set step count and actual km tracking would be appreciated if you can not create a new workout option for Pokemon Go.

Wayne Foote,Functional,The app started out good when I first started using it. But lately it was inaccurate with my walks sometimes saying I walked 0.3 miles other times saying 3 miles. It would get it right occasionally at 1.5 miles. The other thing that was annoying was the heart point awarded sometimes I would get 27 points for the 30 minute 1.5 mile walk other times it would only give me two points for the same walk. I finally un installed it.,FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Alicia Lici,Functional,This menu could be better. Surprisingly Samsung Health is pretty good in comparison. I see now that you could connect to other apps if you have history tracked which is a good idea. But you have to enter food nutrition manually. Why isn't there a food database to search from? I added a start for the cycle tracker. That is a nice feature and I don't have to get another app for that.,New feature,3,,

Laurel Stevens,Functional,"No ads, and some basic functionality. However, it gives me up to four times as many heart points when the phone is in my pocket rather than in my hand while I walk.

A Google user,Functional,simple app that does good job of tracking fitness steps and GPS in background data while you carry phone in pocket.

A Google user,Functional,"Gives me a good idea of how many calories I go through and definitely helps me keep track of my exercise. One thing that annoys me, though, is that tracking my walks results in variable results even though I follow the same route to the extent that one day will be marked as 6.5 miles while the next is 9, even though it's the very same route. A tool to edit these anomalies would be a plus.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Isaac Lamb,Functional,"I use the app for basically two things: step counting and run tracking. It does both of those jobs quite well. I do this through my phone itself without using a smart watch, and I seldom have any issues. The GPS is fairly accurate, definitely more so than other running apps I've used. The user interface is clean and good looking. My one complaint is that it gives far too many heart points for simple activities like going for a slow walk, so I usually go back and manually adjust it.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,

A Google user,Functional,"Pretty good! Used to be perfect, but I recently started having an issue where the location is more inaccurate than usual when I go on a walk.

Joshua S,Functional,"Been using it for a few months now and the only complaint is that under ""Your daily goals"", I want to see the circle graph when I tap on a day, but instead it takes me to the bar chart, which is not immediately useful. It could be displayed separately, but I just want consistency. The path I walk is not accurate on the maps, but as long as the steps are (I believe they are), that's okay.

Glenda Lopez,Functional,"Great app so far that works well for my use. I use it to track steps, exercise (walking and biking), and weight. It has a great UI that's easy to follow and use, and you can set exercise and step goals. I don't give it 5 stars because of the way the exercise choices are listed. First, there are dozens of choices and you cannot search or filter. You have to scroll through all of them to find what you want. Second, the exercises that are there are stored unintuitively. Look at walking. There is fitness walking, nordic walking, paced walking, treadmill walking, and walking. These are all in alphabetical order with other exercises in between, making it difficult to find which walking exercise is best to pick. It's the same way for running, swimming, skating, biking, and other categories of exercise. To make it easier, they should be stored as walking, fitness; walking, nordic; walking, paced; walking, treadmill; walking.

With respect to the primary functionality, I am quite happy with the app.   Original Review (8/19/2019 *) On my Fossil Gen 5 watch, the app fails to connect to the backend and hence does not track anything. There is the spinning wheel at the top showing the failing attempts to establish the connection. On my Pixel 2, Wear OS app shows the watch is connected through BT to the  phone. The Fit app in the phone shows an X in the Journal tab watch icon for sync.   Hugely disappointed, since I got the watch for the heart rate tracking in Google Fit. Everything worked for about a week and then the phone and the watch stopped syncing, even though the app in both devices seemed to be working independently. I performed a factory reset of the watch and since then, the watch app has been failing to connect to the backend.   Google, is there any hope for a fix?",FunctionalCapabilities,4,HI Ranga.

If I could just tap on the part where it shows how many steps I've taken today and then it just shows me a week summary, showing me how many steps I took each day for the week and maybe be able to tap on each day for more details; I'd like that.

I like that I can track my weight, blood pressure, activities, etc.  I took off one star because up until recently I never had a problem with it not tracking my steps.Then it seemed to just quit working as far as the steps go.I sent feedback on 2 separate occasions regarding this. After the 1st time I sent feedback, some time later it started working again then quit (By the way, I checked to make sure my 'Track activity metrics' in the Settings was on & it was).

I've double checked the distance in multiple ways and found it quite accurate, usually, with the exception being laps around a track and other quicker turning routes.

A Google user,Functional,I would definitely rate the app highly. Has been useful to me for many years in keeping track of my exercises. I want to make a suggestion and I really do not know how feasible it would be to enable the feature but I will put it out.

A Google user,Functional,"This app is great at tracking everything I do. For those that don't ""run with their phone"" (who does that), it's a simple solution of getting a WearOS device.

gamer749,Functional,"An excellent app when paired with a Fossil Smart Watch. The watch contains a pulse sensor that continuously monitors your heart rate and the app uses this to help determine calories burn and heart point calculation. Even when you take a break in a workout, as long as your heart is beating fast, you will still burn calories and earn heart points while you cool down. Data is shared with linked apps such as MyFitnessPal and Sleep Cycle to provide a full health profile. Google Fit tracks it all in the journal as well. The smart watch also lets me start, pause and finish the workout without having to pull out the phone. The data migrates to the phone once the workout is complete, though it may take a minute or two over the bluetooth connection. Use this with any smart watch, especially if the watch has the Wear OS operating system. Fitness bands are also compatible, just make sure it can monitor your pulse for more accurate data.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

A lot of the things you can do on this app you can do on your phone, and sometimes a lot more accurately.

Mathew Maury,Functional,I love the app. I've been a happy user for over a decade. I paid the premium upgrade to maintain scanning ability at substantial cost.

Nathan Luistro,Functional,"They took away the barcode scan feature unless you pay a ridiculous amount of money a year for it. This is extremely frustrating and also has caused too many errors and incorrect information because now it's relying on people to plug the information in accurately, which is NOT working.

I used the barcode scanner every time i logged my food in the past, and so did my husband. Now the barcode scanner is only with premium, which is too expensive.

However after revisiting it following a break, all the features that made it a great tool to use now come at a cost.

The water app doesn't let you set your own water goal, and screams at you with an obnoxious full screen graphic every time I add water.

Shae,Functional,the app is obviously old and not updated and less it absolutely has to be to prevent something bad from happening. it has bugs that have existed since its creation from the reviews from users. it integrates poorly with its partner apps and really needs a lot of work done to it. also the tech support team is terrible and just kick the ball around and eventually tells you to figure it out. that all said it's still the best free fitness app out there with partner Google fit in close contention.,New feature,2,"Hi Shae - we do sincerely apologize for this experience. If you are still experiencing any issues, we do recommend reaching back out to our Support Team for assistance. We are always happy to help!",
Bo Bowen,Functional,"The app barely functions. When I delete a food from my diary, sometimes it will add more of the same food over and over again or duplicate other entries randomly. The macronutrients are also incorrect on the meal breakdown, making it very confusing to use. Additionally, the barcode scanner is hit or miss and usually does not work. I may go back to my previous tracking app after this subscription ends. Quite unhappy with this app.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,Hi Bo! Our apologies for any problems you are having.

Greg Sabey,Functional,"I actually paid for the premium version...every so often, the list of foods recently eaten in My Diary will get missorted/deleted. Example: instead of having the 5-7 things I always eat at the top of the list, it's a bunch of things I haven't eaten in years. And when I search, find correct option and log it...that option STILL won't appear at the top of my list the next day! And a few listings I've used have been deleted??

Jacob Camacho,Functional,"App is broken, it constantly asks if I am loving the app after every single action. I don't know if it's because I selected no, or what, but even when I hit x it came back up after the next action. At first it was great, being able to scan food was nice. But I guess I was on a temporary trial that I didn't know I was even on? They changed some of the UI a week later, and I lost that function.

Jenn B,Functional,I had used the app for quite some time and then stopped using it for about a year. I just started up again and the newer UI is really difficult to use. Not being able to disregard the banner about upgrading to premium which takes up the top third of my phone screen and the bottom navigation being curved takes up a significant amount of room on the bottom of my screen. The only usable space is the middle 1/3 of my phone and has made it almost unusable from a navigation standpoint.,FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Thank you for this feedback, and our apologies for any problems you are having exiting out of the Premium upsell screen.

sharon beck,Functional,"This app was very helpful in losing weight, until the UPC scanning functionality was no longer available with the free version.

Geneson Agbayani,Functional,"There are some cool features, but for such an exorbitant expense, I would hope for a cleaner user experience. There are so many verified ingredients that have wrong nutritional information listed it can be a challenge to sift through in order to build a correct calorie count.

Cheyenne Baxter,Functional,"Fitness Pal has great features for calorie and macro counting, water tracking, and syncing to other devises like apple watch or fitbit. The reason for the two star is that the use of FitnessPal use to be free for most things, but now they charge you premium in order to use some of those features. I used to be able to adjust macros, scan barcodes, and search foods fairly easy. Now, I have to purchase the ""premium"" in order to do that.

Allie Boran,Functional,I am super disappointed after using this a few years ago to come back and have a lot of the features be part of the premium membership. Like being able to edit fine and scan barcodes. I feel like those are pretty basic features. Also it is a lot harder navigate the home screen. It seems so much less user friendly. I've noticed a lot similar reviews about the change. The response is always that you can still type in the brand and add it but it used to be free and that disappointing.,FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi Allie, we do understand your frustration on this decision, and we do want to thank you for your feedback.

Kim Brown,Functional,"I used this app years ago with great success. Decided to start using it again, and some of the most basic features, like barcode scanning, have been put behind a paywall.

Jessica M,Functional,"Better in the past. I understand the ads. I understand not having all options available for free. I can even live without the scanner even though I really miss it. But to not having the the protein, carbs and fats given is a big issue.

M R,Functional,"My current food tracker is shutting it's doors this next month - checked this one out to see if it'd be a good alternative, but basically everything useful (that's normally free) is gated behind premium, at $20 a month (or $80 a year). Both options are fairly outrageous. I know you can manually enter items instead of scanning, but that's like saying you can ""manually"" get to Walmart by walking. There's better technology to do so, but it's not quite worth that price. The search continues!",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Weâ€™ll pass this along to our team, thank you.

Nichole B,Functional,"Used to be a fantastic ap. I dont mind when UIs upgrade but it's a lot more cumbersome to get to what I need. Having the scanning removed from basic use was the end-all for me.

Ms. Williams,Functional,"Disappointed, I used myfitnesspal for years along with other apps. I was extremely happy when you could easily scan the barcode. Now they took that feature away so you can pay $19.99/$79.99 for it, which sucks. I won't waste money just for that one feature.

CR Outside,Functional,Been using it for years. One of the things I really liked was the barcode scan feature. A lot of us have busy lives and it made logging much easier. Unfortunately you took this free free feature away and made it part of the premium package and you want us to pay for it. I don't think so.

Zak Edwards,Functional,1. Everything is behind a pay wall. I mean hey make a good product and ask people to pay. But pretty much the whole app is a pay to really use. Just make it a one time payment of x dollars. Then you can have a subscription for the more personalized options. But to do anything you have to pay 80 a year or 20 a month. For the basics of no ads and use a barcode scanner. I'd pay 5 dollars for the app and the maybe that subscription for the app giving me a meal plan or access to the recipes.,FunctionalCapabilities,2,We do apologize for the confusion.

Kelly Wright,Functional,Really disappointed with the changes they've done. I haven't used my fitness Pal in a couple years so I don't know when they made the barcode scanner feature a paid premium item.

I think I might just uninstall this now after not using it for so long and seeing what it looks like.,FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi Kelly, weâ€™re sorry youâ€™re frustrated by the barcode news.

Alex Clavet,Functional,I was pretty happy to re-download this app after a couple years of not using it . I was telling my buddy how amazing it was when I was on a weight loss journey lifting weights . Was very disappointed to see you couldn't scan your items .

Michael Hepner,Functional,"I dropped 3 stars because this company did something that I absolutely disagree with, and believe it just wrong. They have put features that were included in the free version, behind a pay wall. This infuriates me when companies do this. I have no problem in any way, for a company to have premium only features. This is good business. Add new features to the premium version to entice premium purchase . Removing features from the free version, is BAD business practice. Lost my respect and trust.",New feature,2,"Hi Michael, weâ€™ll share your thoughts with the team, thank you. Even without Barcode Scan, free members can log any packaged food by searching the item name. And once you log something, itâ€™s added to your history where you can log it instantly with one tap.",
Jason Miller,Functional,"App has made changes of functions in order to enable more profits. I used to use this app every day. The ability to scan barcodes provided a convenient way to log new meals and ingredients. Now you must subscribe to be able to use the barcode scanning function.

Christina Erickson,Functional,Great for mindful eating and taking a look at a guesstimate of where your goals should be. I wouldn't base actual needs on this app or trust the accuracy on the nutritional value of foods you can't scan.

Keara Phillips-Berlin,Functional,"I have used MyFitnessPal for years, and I restarted recently. I was really disheartened to see the app had taken away elements that were once the flagpole tools of the app, like easy user interface and barcode scanning.

This, and the lack of barcode scanner is inconvenient enough that I will likely uninstall.",New feature,2,"We understand ads can be an annoying part of using free apps.

Kristen S.,Functional,"When I started using this app years ago, the problem was that their food list was very limited, so every time I ate anything I had to manually enter all the nutrition information.

A Google user,Functional,"There's so much I love about this app. I lost 80 pounds using it. For that I would give it 5 stars.   However, I finally signed up for the premium version because I'm a nerd and I wanted to export my data so I could perform data analysis. I want to be able to analyze my weight loss as averages over 3, 5 or 7 days and correlate it with the calorie intake. Unfortunately when I export my data it is missing half of the weight data. It only shows back to January of 2018 when I started tracking my weight in September of 2016. It does include the nutrition summary all the way back to the beginning.   I just noticed that the first time I requested all my data it showed the weight data back to 1/1/2018 but when I requested an export today it only goes back to 1/21/2018. It seems that it's losing more data as time goes on.   Note, when I look at my progress in the app it does show all the way back to the beginning.  I've been working with their support for almost 4 weeks now and they can't seem to solve the problem nor can they tell me when they might have a solution for it. This essentially makes the premium subscription completely useless for me since the data is all I cared about.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Jennifer Running,Functional,"Used to be really good and easy to use. But the bar code scanning was moved to the paid version only, when it was originally free for so long.

Ken Senter,Functional,"Good enough app that I paid for premium after the trial. But it loses two stars for me. 1) For the price it should be easier to use. If what I'm tracking has a barcode then it's very easy and often matches the nutrition info on the package (but not always), but it's not as good when searching/recipe building, too many wildly different choices and it's difficult to know what's right. 2) It notifies me that I forgot to track a meal almost half the time when I have already tracked the meal.",system requirement,3,"Hi Ken, thank you for this feedback and our apologies for any problems you are having with your reminders.

Joelle arrington,Functional,Loved the app. Been using it for years. Probably a decade or longer. Can't use barcode scanner anymore. It's moved to subscription. I get it. They want money. But I'll just move to a free app. The number of advertisements to get the paid version is so overbearing the free version isn't even worth using now. It's an amazing app. I'd pay a one time fee to own it outright.

Savannah Dube,Functional,"I've used this app for almost 5 years now, on and off.

Alexandra Amato,Functional,"MFP is solid enough. It does a pretty good job of being a calorie counter. In recent years though, I feel like the scanner has gotten worse, it is hit or miss even though once I enter the product manually it shows up. The price of premium is what ultimately drove me away.

Richard Hatch,Functional,"Like others, I think that removing the barcode scanner from the free version was a dick move, but whatever.

I didnt expect to see many vegan options in the food data base , which I'm used to although it would be nice to see more of. I was definitely disappointed with the lack of exercises available to click on in the database of movements. Squat cleans is definitely not a new or foreign exercise . It's more work than it's worth to create a new exercise for every single daily entry . The biggest disappointment was the app not being able to account for calories burned in strength training.

Alex,Functional,This app has really help me see where my calories are coming from. The scan feature allows for quick additions and the database is always growing. I also really like how you can create custom recipes as well as copy meals over.

Adam S,Functional,"Seems pretty nice for the first day of using.

Please change this.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,Thank you for this feedback! We are happy to hear you are still enjoying the app otherwise.,
Julianne H,Functional,"I've used the free mfp for years and it's great. It's 4 stars instead of 5 bc they took away my ability to scan barcode labels. Now when I try I get a screen that tells me to upgrade to a paid membership. My friend can still scan barcode labels for free. I can't afford the paid version. Otherwise, I really like that you can track progress, see nutrients, adjust goals, create/copy meals, enter recipes, and sync w fitbit. Check foods for accuracy, user-entered foods can have incorrect cals etc.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Hi, thanks for reaching out. Weâ€™re sorry youâ€™re disappointed about Barcode Scan.

Angelica S.,Functional,"Great for what it is, a calorie counter and a step towards healthier living. I like that you can connect and sync other apps to it to make your life easier, but I think it's about time to update the list of apps that you can connect and sync with. For ex., in my opinion, I think there are better options to use besides the Glow app for logging/syncing feminine health info, since it seems Glow seems to have gone downhill since the partnership and I think it's time you found a new partnership. :)",New feature,4,Thank you for providing this feedback.

Heather Whetzel,Functional,"I have been using this app for 4 years. Overall, it's reliable, but like this week, it has been so Clichy adding food I didn't add.

shannon washington,Functional,"Used to use this and there's been major overhaul. Adding items to your meal you're creating is weird because the ""+"" button location makes it seem like you'd be adding your meal to your library, not adding ingredients. It was a weird design. Also, I truly dont care that I can still (annoyingly) enter foods in the search and HOPE I can find them. The barcode scanner being behind a paywall is just greedy when it was free before.

Old bugs (like non-functional links in notifications, or white screen on opening them within the app) STILL exist despite complaints as far back as 2012.

Kristie Stariha,Functional,"It's nice being able to keep up with what you are eating, just look very closely at what you are adding. The vast majority of the foods that are on the app have the wrong nutritional info. Don't just scan a barcode and move on, look to see if it is correct.

A Google user,Functional,It can become tedious when you are loading one item at a time in the food diary. A check off box next to items selected would save me a lot of time. Recently used foods is saved which is good but not in alphabetical order so you have to go through the whole list to find the apple. But then its free!Perhaps when you pay none of this is an issue. Having problems connecting my Alta fitbit but again this may only work if purchased. Bar coding is great!! I Love it like to see some improvements! Thanks.,New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Had it for a week. Definitely helps me track calories and the free version has good options. I've noticed a glitch or two (like foods disappearing) but that's been minimal. I really like the barcode scanner. That's my favorite part. UPDATE. Had it now for almost 2 months. I've lost 10 lb or so since starting. Helps me stay disciplined and realistic about calorie goals. I only use the free version. No more glitches, either.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"The database of foods is astonishing, and the functionality makes tracking food, weight, water, and exercise easy. With it, I was able to lose about 35 lbs in about six months, simply through rigorous tracking. I take a star off for two reasons. The first is for some bugs, including not being able to get input from my pedometer app (which is claimed to be supported and worked initially, but ceased and cannot be reestablished). The second reason is the incessant marketing. Near daily advertising for UA products gets a bit annoying. I might be more receptive if it wasn't so frequent. But it's basic human biology that the body and mind eventually drown out constant stimuli.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"A very useful and helpful app to keep track of calories and other diet components (carbs, fats, proteins, sugars, etc.) I especially like and appreciate the gentle but persistent nagging to enter meals, as well as the periodic reminders on daily diet component targets. The only shortcoming I have found is that -sometimes - the food statistics (even those with a green check box, which is supposed to mean the entries have been checked and verified. don't always align with the information shown on the actual food packaging. Differences are not huge, but one of the two has to be wrong.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"I love this app. It has been life-changing to have such a convenient way to track the foods I eat and how they align with my nutritional goals. Using the web interface I can readily search foods I've eaten in the year and a half since I first downloaded. This release crashes occasionally on my phone, and there are still issues with routing. For example, I'll log dinner for yesterday, and the app returns me to the screen for today. Overall, though, it's awesome.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Great app! I'm usually pretty lazy when it comes to keeping track of the foods/calories I consume, bit this app makes it super easy. I love that you can scan barcodes and that there is such a big variety of foods that come up when you search. It really is very inclusive, even when it comes to the options for workouts. The map portion when you search for nearby restaurants could use some work. It misses a lot of the ones that are around me. But altogether, great app. Highly recommend!",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"4.5 stars. Easy to set goals and record food. See at a glance what you have left for the day. Simple to look back at prior days or view weekly results. I like being able to create recipes - saves time entering. Two issues: 1) when I change goals, all screens don't reflect them so there are two sets of goals (confusing and not useful), 2) even though I chose very low carb, sugar goals are way high in the nutrient section. I paid for premium but so far only use one feature so may cancel before trial is over. (I was hoping to also use the app to limit salt intake down the road but haven't found a way to do so (yet?).",New feature,4,,
Anna Eland,Functional,"I think this is a great way for me to track everything from water intake to excercise. I also enjoy the extra features like plans and nutritional content tracking.

For instance, if I walked at a pace of 3.7 miles per hour I have to use the pre-programmed 3.5 miles per hour. A small thing, but I have used other apps where this feature is standard.

Andrew Berger,Functional,"I've been using the Premium version of the app for 4 weeks now and overall I'm satisfied. User friendly, great food database, easy method for logging caloric intake, tracking nutrition, creating recipes. One major issue is that the app does not automatically adjust your daily calorie goal as you lose weight. If you adjust this manually, then it resets any other custom settings you have in place. It's a significant flaw that apparently been known for years, but no one thought to correct!",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Patience Graybill,Functional,"The app has made a big difference for me. I'm learning that I can eat the same foods ,just in moderation. Chose this app for its database of foods and easy work-flow. I find it very easy to find and track foods. I appreciate the estimated calorie and macro-nutrient values. The ability to add food by scanning the bar code is amazing! Con is that adding hime-cooked food is difficult. I end up adding individual ingredients. Also, I do not use the fitness tracker integration. Can't speak to that.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Zombalaya Q,Functional,I love this app! It makes it so easy to track calories and other nutritional stats throughout the day. Food items are easy to find and input as well! My only issue is that I wish it would allow you to make new recipes from already created ones. Some recipes only have a few ingredient changes and it's bothersome to have to input all those ingredients all over again. I also don't like that you can't shift whole meals throughout the day. You have to move them single entry by entry.,New feature,4,,

Jonah Rabinowitz-Buchanan,Functional,"Free version is a useful app for tracking food. I cant speak to the paid version, but I imagine its helpful as well.

Unbelievably annoying, and in no way convinced me that I should upgrade.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Overall it's a good experience and I've been using it for several years. The fitness tracking is pretty limited though. And there's a big push for upsell even though there are lots of ads. Food database is pretty good for calorie counts, but very inaccurate for other nutrients.

I have nothing better to recommend, but it doesn't delight the way my 5 star apps do.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Very helpful! I love all the features. However, the connectivity to my Fit bit isn't the most reliable. Sometimes it works great and others it won't work at all. The app usually makes my phone run a little slow as well. But, the pros definitely outweigh the cons and those are small prices to pay for a free app that does everything it does.

A Google user,Functional,"Great app for tracking calories, both intake and calories burned. I love that you can scan bar codes on food packaging to instantly add the nutritional information.

A Google user,Functional,"I like that this app is flexible. It is a great tool for tracking calories, macros, water intake, and exercise. I appreciate that tool. The only thing I do not like about it is when i put food in for instance a large boiled egg there are way too many options and can be confusing which one to pick. The other downfall is when I am looking directly at the package of food and its nutrients and I look it up on this app and it gives me 10 calories more than what the package says. Overall it's good.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"This app is very nice. However, I cannot see any way to provide diet modifications that would alter one's personal requirements in the macros and nutrient analysis, e.g. low fat, low cholesterol, etc. If this is a function available in the Premium version, they don't say. There are limited exercise options when entering activity. The app appears geared toward fitness buffs and athletes, and seems to ignore other demographics. Most of the recipes on the home page are high in fat, which renders them useless to me.

Thomas Standers,Functional,"This is a great app for calorie management. The list of foods in the database are incredible! The best feature is the barcode reader. The ability to zero in on the exact calorie count is great. Only one drawback, the inability to change some serving sizes. Some foods do not have grams as a serving size. Instead it might have fluid ounces when it is a dry good measurement. Since I weigh my food intake including liquids, grams should be a choice. Secondarily, ounces should also be available.",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Great app for tracking meals and getting a snapshot of your eating patterns. Only prob is it's SOOOOO hard to create a recipe!

Jordan Argyle,Functional,"I have used this app for several years to help me track the food I eat. It's been super helpful, and barcose scanning to add food was great! Huge user catalogue of food, I rarely found something jot listed. But, I've watched them add more ads over time, which is annoying but I get it - gotta make some money. Recently, however, features I heavily used have been locked behind a subscription or membership for 80/year.

Angela Lewis,Functional,"It has become definitely more user friendly than the last time I tried to use it. I wish it would more easily bring up the things that I choose. For instance my dayia supreme pizza, for which I use the barcode reader but when I try to put in the name the app acts like it's never ever seen it before. So it would be faster if it would add the things that I eat so I could simply bring them up again without having to resort to the barcode reader. Once I've thrown the box away barcodes don't help.",New feature,4,,
C Schrader,Functional,"I've used the app for years and have loved it. But the recent addition of putting ads (I think, it just spins and won't open) over the app when first opened makes it a pain. On my Samsung S10+ the ad doesn't open and I have to go through extra steps just to view the contents of the app, whether being the feed, my diary or whatever. Include the ads somewhere else please, not overtop the app itself. This loss of function and ease of use has me thinking of using a different app.",system requirement,4,,
Diane Fuller,Functional,"I'm finding this app useful and so far, have been losing weight using it and for this, I'm happy with it. I would've given it 5 stars if not for one issue. I connected my Samsung Health app to it so my steps can be counted from either my phone or my Galaxy watch, but it doesn't work. I've followed all the steps and no matter what I try, I just keep getting a sync error. It wouldn't be such a big deal if I could just add my steps manually, but there's no option for that.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Some difficulties in accessing content that is supposed to be visible with my friend's custom added recipes and foods. Still not sure how to do that, even though their profile shows it should be visible to friends. Also cannot copy just one item from a meal to another day.

Looking forward to continuing to see how it can work for me!",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Helps keep us on track and make better choices. There are occasional glitches but were able to resolve by uninstalling and reinstalling without losing personal data.

Caro L.C. W.,Functional,"I've used this app off and on for quite a few years. It seems to be the most complete and helpful for me in terms of my needs. The food database is questionable at times, but with a bit of cross-checking you can find the accurate item. 3.3.21: don't like they changed the macro colors. Leaving fats red (a warm color) and changing protein & carbs to cool colors makes it stand out more, and leaves those of us who follow a low-carb diet the connotation of ""fat is bad"" which is an outdated idea.",system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Easy to navigate, and I haven't found a food it doesn't have yet. Already made a couple personalized recipes to dial in on what my calorie/protein intake is. Adding exercise is easy, and the feed has some interesting recipes. Really is everything I was looking for. Only reason for 4 stars is the absolutely horrendous start I had to get set up & registered, so frustrating I almost threw in the towel.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,Our apologies for any problems you are having. Can you please follow the link https://t.co/a1pmDmaSg2 for further help? Thanks.,
George Jones,Functional,"The free version is more than adequate for me. I like the workout demos and recipe suggestions. I like that I can link this to Map My Walk or Map My Run, also Under Armour apps. It takes your height, weight and activity into account and gives you realistic calorie goals. However, it would be nice to get nutrition and exercise management in one place, instead of linking two apps. The ads are annoying, and the app navigation could be smoother. Overall, this is a fun, well rounded app.",New feature,4,,
SÃ©abra,Functional,"It was working pretty well until the last update. Now it won't keep track of my steps and exercises on google fit even though it says they are synced. I've reinstalled both apps and it didn't help. So I have to add that all manually every time which is very annoying. Also, since the last update, it won't let me take scrolling screenshots of the main diary page. I thought that was odd. Other than that it's still a pretty decent calorie and nutrition tracker. But folks please fix these bugs!",Security Requirements,4,,
A Google user,Functional,Helpful in keeping track of what I eat. Had a few things I noticed where the nutritional value was off a bit so do make sure you look at all that before you select your food item. Calcium was way off on a few things like spaghetti squash for example. There's usually several choices for each item of food so try finding another one if you notice something seems way off.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Randi Cline,Functional,"I have used this app for a LONG time and have made immense progress because of it. Like everyone else I am super frustrated that I can no longer use the scanner for free. Especially as a super busy mom, that convenience was super helpful. The app is still good. With or without the barcode scanner it still fulfills its main purpose - helping me track calories. I'm bummed but I'm still going to use it even if it takes a minute longer to log. Thanks for a good product over the years.",New feature,4,"Hey Randi, thanks for sharing your feedbackâ€”though weâ€™re sorry youâ€™re disappointed.

A Google user,Functional,"I am enjoying this ap. There are tons of food options and logging my meals is easy. I think the pages could be more visually comprehensive, I find myself scrolling up and down and I don't understand the ""community"" aspect of the ap. I just want to keep track of my calories. I like that I can link my exercise aps but they do not always sync up, and there is often discrepancy in how many calories I burnt. Looking forward to using it more.",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Works great for what I need. Tracks calories. Tracks weight. You can upload progress photos. It has a barcode scanner so you can track exactly what you eat. You can load exercises and it will track calories burned. If you are wanting to track macros, you have to pay for the extension, the free version only tracks calories. The only ""downside"" is the occasional ad. But its really no big deal.",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Being able to scan items is great as is menu items for known restaurants which their are many. However, if we make food at home, it does not accumulate items very well or it can take way too much time to enter homemade items made the way you like it. The usually option is to enter each item individually or create menu or dinner items. Most do not make the same things even each week but that can help a lot if you at least create your own menu items.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Chad Irby,Functional,"This app is great for tracking macros! I have found a few issues though. When searching food items, it won't let you change the serving size until you save the item and go back in and change the size. If I am entering a bunch of items at one time for dinner, I basically have to enter the information twice. Also, the OS app is different than the Android app when it comes to pre loaded items. If I enter the same exact food item and serving size on both platforms, I get a different calorie amount.",system requirement,4,,
Jessica Bradfield,Functional,"This is the app I keep coming back to, even when I try others. I love it. It's easy to use, and I've lost 29 lbs just faithfully tracking food and exercise.

It's super annoying when it syncs sometimes, sorta syncs others, and sometimes not at all.",system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"This app seems really awesome, but it is SO glitchy when adding/modifying food items to the food diary! I have to find something more reliable. I cannot put things in, get an error message, try again, just to have it show up 4 times. I've only used this app for 2 days. UPDATE: I closed the app and reopened it, and it worked fine. Still, frustrating to have to close and reopen the app when you're short on time.",Security Requirements,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"this app is actually helping me lose weight. it's not too much of a bother to log in foods, the app makes that pretty easy. you have to do some estimating. only concern is that the crowd sourced food items sometimes have dubious calorie counts, so you may have to double check or pick a different food item that better matches what you've eaten. the ability to scan a food bar code is great though!! the ads and suggestions to upgrade have not been annoying for me at all. give it a try!",New feature,4,,
Iana Amke,Functional,"Amazing calorie tracking app. It's easy to add food and if you can't find what you're looking for, you can easily add your own meals/recipes. I love that it also syncs with Google fit although on most days, it only syncs my steps but does not sync other workouts especially if the data was uploaded from another workout app. Also, a challenges page would be great instead of having to go through your notifications to find them. And maybe more personalised plan varieties for premium users.",New feature,4,,
Darrell Cyphers,Functional,"Got this when making the serious decision to shed that last, stubborn, 10 pounds. Then discovered, to my delight, its pairing with Map My Ride, wedding calories burned with calories consumed.

Good job.",New feature,4,,
Bobbi Mauck,Functional,App is really easy to keep track of your calorie intake. I really like that they have added the barcode scanning option. It won't connect with Gloryfit but that's ok because I don't think the way they calculate your steps to extra calories you can have is correct anyway.

A Google user,Functional,Overall it does what it says it does and I haven't seen a need to upgrade to the paid version. It loses a star for still not having step count integration with Google Fit. It transfers exercises but not the basic step count. That's been in their bug list for at least a year and a half; not sure what's taking so long.,system requirement,4,,
Riley Perry,Functional,"Just figured out how to make my own meals on the app to avoid adding each ingredient individually. The app isn't the easiest to use but it works. The servings are a pain to adjust as it leaves out grams or ounces are certain things and doesn't give you the option to add a ratio connecting the two. Also, the label reader darkens my camera and can only be used in very bright lighting.",New feature,4,Thanks for your inquiry.

I'd also really enjoy an ergonomics focused redesign for all the great data, but they still have great graphs and charts to help you quickly understand nutrients for weekly or daily review, it just needs more intuitive data layout and packaging",New feature,4,,
Sasha Shame,Functional,"Overall I love this app, and it has been extremely valuable and helping me to maintain my health goals. Like many others here, I feel that removing the barcode scanner as a clear money grab is an unwise business move. Considering that the free version has ads, I think the amount of money gained from premium memberships will not be worth it overall versus the loss of ad revenue that is generated from the free version once people drop the app due to not being able to use the barcode scanner.",New feature,4,Thank you for taking the time to review the MyFitnessPal app. Hereâ€™s a little more detail about our decision to move Barcode Scan to Premium - https://rebrand.ly/barcode22,

A Google user,Functional,"Update: Feb 26, 2020 - scanning barcodes on foods which I have scanned before now displays an error message. I've been using this app for a week and it's awesome to be able to track weight goals and daily nutrition stats.

The weirdest bug is being able to scan a food barcode but not able to add it or keep it added to the day.",Security Requirements,4,,
Desiree Tudder,Functional,I've used MFP before and didn't care for it. I gave it another shot (years later) and so far I'm enjoying it. It helps that I have a better understanding of healthy food choices (before I had done ww successfully for almost a year when the plan changed and was no longer working for me. Without the points system I was lost. I didn't understand what made certain foods better than others on the point system). Having at least some kind of nutritional plan helps. App is easy to use once used to it.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Matthew Moore,Functional,Great way to track calories. But could use some small changes for a better user experience. I'd like to see a way to add food items that I have already entered. Sometimes people eat left overs. It's difficult and time consuming to find the exact item you've entered in the past with such a large database. Also I would like to see a way to manually enter calories and other values. When I make my own meals I can calculate the calories myself. Being able to simply enter that value would be helpful,New feature,4,,
Brad Giessing,Functional,"One of the best trackers out there, also one of the most buggiest. Once I connect my step tracker, I have to disconnect it and add it daily for it to continue working. Things randomly disappear and appear. I add 20 oz of water that I drink, it never shows up. I go in at it again and never shows up. I add a third time and there's 60 oz. Same thing with food.

A Google user,Functional,"Quick, easy, user friendly. Some of the food information is out of date, or not in the system meaning I have to manually enter it all. It's inconvenient that after I enter it all, it still doesn't link it to the barcode.

Isabel DeLaCruz,Functional,"Great app. I just wished it had some features, such as repeating meals (I drink tea every morning) so I don't have to enter them every day.

A Google user,Functional,This app is fantastic! I love that you can enter in a recipe and say how many servings you had of it. It makes the calorie counting so easy. With other apps i had to try and guess how much of each ingredient I actually ate... The only complaints I have are that they dont have caloeie expenditure for strength training yet and not all step trackers can be synced. The one I have doesnt and I don't want to get a step tracker app because I rarely have my phone in my pocket.,New feature,4,,
Jane R,Functional,"Useful calorie tracker with a lot of user inputted foods! Some of the entries are not accurate, some of them are.

Kent Chambers,Functional,"It was fairly easy to figure out how to use it. But if you use both app and website there are numerous differences in how you do data entry...nav is completely different. I never could get it to work with Samsung Health. Easiest way to log food is to scan barcode. But it's a guess as to the quantity of the item you're logging. Units of measure are not as always intuitive. I like the pie chart that displays Fat, Carbs and Protein...very useful.",system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"It has been very easy to track all my calorie intake. Overall, I am extremely happy with it and it has really helped me with the nutrition side of weight loss. Cons: Sometimes you cannot find the measurement type that you are using for the item you are eating (eg. cups vs ounces) which makes it hard to break down or split portion sizes. Also, I find some of the major nutrition facts on everyday foods is missing (eg. Sugar, fiber, etc) and this affects your tally of those items for the day.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Vic,Functional,"Overall, this is an excellent app. One annoying bug: If I enter an exercise and then edit it, instead of an actual edit, it creates a new entry, so there is then two entries. Example: I do cardiovascular exercise. I input 20 minutes and 220 calories. I end up working out a bit more, so I edit it, changing it to 26 minutes and 250 calories.

John W,Functional,"It takes a minute to get the hang of this app, and it's far from perfect. Looking up foods is annoying. The serving sizes take some mental math.

In the real world, it really does help turn your focus to what you're eating.

Trish Seymour,Functional,"Great app for tracking calories, exercise, water intake. Like the videos offering tips/tricks/recipes. You can join challenges, groups. Pretty neat for a fitness app. Obviously the free download is FULL of ads; if you're a distracted reader, spring for the premium. Only reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars- can' t delete a mistaken entry in food diary (or I've not been able to figure out how!). But you can go back in & change serving size, so I'll change the mistake to "".05"" of a serving. ðŸ˜ƒ",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Surprisingly happy with it. I was very resistant to using a calorie-counting app, but once I started using it, it wasn't just easy to use, it was remarkably informative! The biggest drawback is that it keeps giving me pointless recommendations. I'm on a low-carb, intermittent fasting regimen and the app keeps giving me recommendations for just a regular calorie-restricted diet. If I could input my specific plan, this app would be perfect!",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"This app has come a long way! It's easy to use and includes an impressive variety of foods. The Friends/social support aspect, sadly, has limited functionality and is too clunky. It would be neat if the deduced what nutrients your low on and populated the recipes with ones that would be help balance out remaining nutrients and macros.

Martin Barrell,Functional,Good for tracking calories and checking nutrients. Would be far better if there were not so many apparently duplicate entries for foods (many of which are inaccurate) and a better way of searching.

A Google user,Functional,"This app helped me lose weight and I cannot be more happy. This is one of the best calorie counters out there. (Even though this is the only one I've ever used) The notifications are a bit wonky, and sometimes you'll have to manually put in what you ate because the nutritional information may be wrong or the product won't exist. I don't think this is the apps fault, though. You can simply scan a bar code on what you ate and I love that. The app has a website version, but the sync sucks. Thankfully, in the settings tab, there's a sync button to sort that problem out. Overall, even with it's slight issues, I definitely recommend this.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

Super simple interface with a huge database of foods, the option to conveniently log them by scanning a barcode is great! Good customer support and I have had success with this app. Interesting and informative articles come with it and it really builds awareness of how calories add up and where they are coming from.

It's great!!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Great app, love just about everything about it. I have been using it for 4 years at this point and don't have any complaints.

Felicity Galea,Functional,"I love this app. I have been using just the free version for several years. It is a great aide for mindful nutrition, weight management, and identifying food allergies.

I can see if I need more of something like iron, and there is a pie chart showing percentages of protein, fats, and carbohydrates, making it easy to see what needs to be adjusted.",New feature,5,,
Brandon Pitman,Functional,"I'm strictly counting calories to lose weight (goal is to lose 30lbs, currently down 17lbs). This app provides the ease of scanning bar codes so that you don't have to manually enter all the information and offers the ability to enter exercises for burned calories, which is really convenient and easy to understand! Depending on how everything goes with weight loss, I may decide to purchase the full app capabilities. Overall, if you are focused on calorie counting, this is a great app!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"The free version is actually really powerful for tracking your meals. There are a ton of foods already in the database. The ability to add stand alone nutrition information is limited to only calories, with the ability to add stands alone macros behind a paid subscription. Reminders make sure you stay up to date with your meal tracking. Highly recommended if you are trying to hit a weight loss goal.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Great program for tracking diet habits and nutrition. Automatically lets you know when you've hit goals for specific nutrients based on weight and diet targets, and reminds you to log meals(you can turn this function off if it bothers you which is nice). Needs improvement for the exercise side of the app, in that it's missing a number of common exercises thaat should definitely be there(no burpees)in its database, and offers no way to add your own. Overall excellent quality, intuitive and extremely useful but could be even better with just a couple little touches.",New feature,5,,
Rachel Bailey,Functional,"Sometimes it really isn't the app. I was having issues with saving recipes, even after installing and reinstalling it. I was sure the app was the issue. Then my phone stopped sending and receiving photo messages. Then it couldn't text or call at all. I talked to tech support for a week before I finally upgraded to a new phone. I had an S9 Plus that I was reluctant to give up, but now I have a Motorola Stylus and suddenly the app works flawlessly again. I'm relieved and so happy with it.",system requirement,5,"We are truly sorry for any issues you are having with the app. If you could please visit: https://myfitnesspal.zendesk.com/hc/ or send an email to support@myfitnesspal.com for further help.

A Google user,Functional,"I like it very much. I would like to be able to edit a name of an item i.e. from frozen spinach to spinach, frozen. I've noticed some unwanted changes in the application that just take up a lot more screen space. And after making an entry the app defaults to the beginning of a page where it use to take me back to where I was before making the entry.",New feature,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Have used it for years. Great app. Food data base is very large, which I appreciate. It still doesn't have small local restaurants in it, so I must find the best match, or enter appropriate recipes or ingredients. Still and all, I've lost about 50 pounds and kept it off for years. Maintenance is very challenging. I keep exercising and tracking calories, but weight creeps up! Vigilance is key! ðŸ˜Š",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Brian Feldman,Functional,"Virtually everything I eat is already available by quick bar code scan. If not, it'll be there by search. Once the app learns your preferences it's super fast and easy. Keeps track of macros, vitamins, and exercise too (will link to your other apps so you don't have to even enter it). Perfect for helping you keep accurate track what you eat so you have a real chance of eating right.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Sister Elizee,Functional,"(FREE VERSION USER). Great app. Even the free version is very helpful. I can keep my progress on track because I can track my eating and exercise activities on this app. It calculates estimated future results. I'll keep the free version for six months. If I'm still using it daily, I'll get the annual package. I wish that it had a built-in calculator with the four base functions for manual entry. For now, I'm switching between this app and my calculator app to get the off measurements just right.",New feature,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"I've only used the free version (considering upgrading to Premium though, just cause I'm working on a weight gain goal and think it might be more helpful), and it's a great app to track your food intake. That's about all I've used it for; I haven't dug into the other features. Tons of foods in the db but you need to double check after you scan barcodes (my preferred input method) because the stored food may not be correct, though it usually is.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Very easy to use taking little time and very helpful intracking food intake, exercise, water consumption, etc. It scans labels to automatically giving details like calories per serving, serving size and more. It can even go into greater details in nutrion tracking which I do not use at this time, pehaps when I get closer to my goal weight. ( I have a significant amount to lose). This app is making success a certainty for me. A must try app for anyone who is ready to lose. Love it!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"I love this app. I have used it on and off for about 5 years, and it never fails. I do not have the premium version, but the regular version lets you track macros, scan food, create your own custom meals, track your weight, and set goals. The graphs that demonstrate your weight loss are fun to look at too. I downloaded the Lose It app and while it is prettier, it would not let me log my meals for the next day on the free version which is CRAZY. MFP gives you everything you need.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Brandy Newlun,Functional,I haven't subscribed to the premium version of the app...yet. Its been great so far. I do wish the free version would sync my fitbit daily steps. I guess if I get the premium version it will be for that purpose only. Otherwise the lite version is awesome and is easy to use. My fav parts are the barcode scanner and the recipe finder for easy nutritional information.,New feature,5,,
Evan Wallace,Functional,"As other people have mentioned the most recent updates have messed up the step syncing with Fitbit app. It varies every day whether or not I will get all of my steps added in. It worked most of the day today until just before I posted this comment. No matter how many times you try to reconnect, uninstall/reinstall, or restart your phone it doesn't fix the issue. I love this app and hope that they will work out these bugs soon. Edit - Bugs have been fixed!",New feature,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"I really like using the (free version) of the app. I'm using it to count calories and log exercise. It's simple and it also gives some advice and guidance on nutrition as you go. Sometimes, if i make something at home, I'll find the next closest version of that food (from a restaurant or something) and use that instead of trying to custom enter the home recipe.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Great for tracking your food intake. You're able to scan foods with a bar code to quickly add it to your diary, if it is in the database. I would say 90-95% of what you scan will be recognized. Just be sure to input the right amount of servings. There's also a section for progress for weight loss. The free app allows you to focus on calories but macros are displayed. For more customization, you have to buy the app, but i haven't felt the need to yet. recommended app!",New feature,5,,
Ed Delgado,Functional,"Hand down one of my favorite calorie/macro tracking apps. I did pay for the full ad free version. The extra features are great. It's kept me honest about how I'm eating. It's given me the ability to balance my diet to my specific needs. The bar code scanner makes tracking easy. One complaint, some items aren't able to be measured using standardized measurements. I would prefer to use unit of weight (grams,ml etc). Some items are measured by tablespoon or teaspoon which has me googling.",New feature,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"I love this app, and it's really helped me track what I eat and lose weight. It's super helpful that you can customize your own calorie and nutritional goals, and integrate your exercise and lots of other apps and devices you might be using (like fitbit). Also the ""scan your food"" option makes tracking calories and nutritional information super easy. My only complaint is that the app is occasionally a little glitchy, but it typically fixes itself if I close and re-open it.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,I was looking for an app that would help me track food intake and weight loss at the same time. This app helps me hold myself accountable for what i eat and makes it really easy to save meals and recipe i use often. I would have liked to go with the pro version for some of the added features like saving recipes and additional nutrition info but i don't want to be suckered into another subscription. I wish there were different Tiers maybe. Otherwise love the Free version.,New feature,5,,
Hannah Clay-barber,Functional,"I've been using this for one week and I love it. It doesn't just keep track of calories, but the nutrients you eat. My favorite feature is at the end of the day, they estimate how much you could weigh based off your net calories. I find that calculation keeps me accountable and motivated so I don't skip tracking meals and I move my body/workout more. Easy to use, full of helpful information, and minimal advertising for the free version. Very good app.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Jessica Lynne,Functional,"Everything I need in an app. I maxed out on characters trying to explain all of the features it has. Things I wouldn't have even thought to track along with in-app information on a massive variety of work outs, recipes, calorie count. Even a barcode scanner for ease. The app has neve crashed on me, it's easy to navigate, and I'm constantly impressed with the variety of helpful options. This app was recommended to me, and I sure bring it up to others.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Robert Mihara,Functional,"I've used this app for over 1000 days and find it relatively easy to use. I track 3 meals and 3 snacks a day on my smart phone. The data transferred quickly to my laptop for a more detailed look. I wish the database had more dishes from local restaurants. I seem to order meals where I have no detailed knowledge of the ingredients. This shortfall makes accurate tracking hard. However, I have learned to live with this.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"I love it and am considering the premium. I know some have stated they can not change the serving but I have no problem changing the serving to .5 or .75 or whatever percent of the serving size I am eating, perhaps it is how it is being entered but no problem here. The premium service will cost $9.99 a month or $49.99 a year and I would say the year is the better cost option if upgrading to premium. I believe they will give you 30 day free trial of premium to try it. If it were $5 month I would probably try it and if I liked it switch to yearly but $10 month equates to $120 yearly and I can not justify it when so many apps cost less. I feel the free app is great, of course nothing is really free and the cost to us is seeing the pop up ads but still worth a free app that works the way I want it to.",New feature,5,,
Cheryl Nielsen,Functional,"Although the premium is nice I do not need it, the free version does enough for me. It is easy to use. I did have an issue when I tried to cancel my free trial, a glitch made it loop back to the playstore to install the app again and would not let me cancel before they charged me. However, almost immediately after I sent the complaint, I got a reply that it had been cancelled and I would receive the refund for the subscription so I feel they are very customer service oriented.",Security Requirements,5,"Hi Cheryl, our sincere apologies for any problems you are having.

Ryan Harp,Functional,"Love this app, been using it for years now. My only gripe isn't really a gripe but a suggestion and a feature I'd really like to have. Dark mode. I have really bad eyes and seeing they screen so white and bright makes it hard to read what I'm doing. It's a simple feature to add. Other than that this app is awesome. It can sync with Samsung Health making it easy to just scan a barcode and have it sync.",New feature,5,,
Elizabeth Judge,Functional,"Very useful! I have never counted calories before so took some getting used to. The foods I searched were almost always already in their catalog list which is a tremendous time saver. The ads certainly get in the way but are taylored to me so not quite as annoying. I may just bite the bullet and pay for a year. It's a reasonable fee. Good app! I never wanted to wear a fitness tracker before but now I am into the ""game"" of tracking my steps, etc all day long to upload into the Exercise portion.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Love all of the features that come with the free app. I was able to drop over 20 lbs and get back to where I feel comfortable. Being able to scan foods, save recipes and meals helped me to make smart calorie choices.

If you need help with your health and fitness goals this is a great tool!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"I love this app. It helps me not overeat. I've maybe lost a few pounds in over a week of using it. I like the challenges since they help motivate me. Some things I wish it did different are the following. Show that I've completed a diary. Whenever I click the complete button, I can always click it again. Id like the app to tell me that I've already clicked it. I also would like the log food reminders to be turned off after you have logged meals. Finally, I wish there was more exercise options.",New feature,5,,

There's a community of people and alot of extra help and motivators that come along with this app too. It has just about any restaraunt menu or grocery item you'd think of, so that's always nice. You don't have to figure out calories or nutrition info, it's just there! I've recommended it multiple times and my friends/family have also had success and enjoyed it.

I decided to try it again and am very impressed with all improvements and add on's that are available.

Movin' It with Mel,Functional,"Super easy - way better than pen and paper (yes, I did that for about a year)! I especially like that it figures my exercise into the calories I have left to consume so it both encourages me to work out more and gives me the opportunity to eat more based on the extra calories I burn.

Holly Bentley,Functional,If you're looking for a convenient way to count calories this app does that and then some.

W Jeff,Functional,"I have been using it for a few years now. It's a great program that works for every goal I have had, whether to lose weight, run longer, or maintain my weight. The feature to adjust the caloric intake and percentages has been incredibly helpful. The option to input my own recipes is easier than it was before. I have not experienced any glitches with the program.",New feature,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Great app. Everything that you need is free, the premium stuff is just extra. This app has helped me to lose weight, and stay healthy and accountable. It also helps to plan out my meals ahead of time. One minor problem- I believe that the users are the people who add the food nutritional profiles. Just check for accuracy when you are adding a new food, because sometimes it is wrong. Overall would recommend.",system requirement,5,,
Zach Speck,Functional,"Excellent app. I highly recommend it. I love that I can scan barcodes for nutrition information, but I can also calculate it all manually and input it myself. I highly recommend this app to anyone - from athletes, to casual calorie counters, to people just trying to lose weight. It's very user friendly and an excellent way to track what you take in to your body. Best of all, the free version actually WORKS!",New feature,5,,
Catherine Hudson,Functional,I'm so totally new to weight loss because I've always been thin. This app is so simple that a small child could navigate it. I have learned so much from just using it in a short time. It has the really cool scanner that has recognized the barcode of everything I have put it on even store brand and locally made brands. The database is HUGE! It also allows me to put in my own homemade meals and subtracts the calories and puts the nutrients in the proper categories. I've lost 7 lbs so far! Love it,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Using this to track calories and food but it links with my garmin to adjust for calorie burn, steps, and workouts. The notifications are not annoying. Used it for 3 weeks now and haven't got bored. I'm sure you can do more with it but I'm just using its basic functions. I have yet to scan a barcode it doesn't recognize and I have scanned some unusual organic or speciality items. Bottom line- This is a good app to track calories",New feature,5,,
Julian Martinez,Functional,"Makes watching my food so much easier. Whenever I have a food I haven't eaten before, if I scan the barcode it will stay in my list and if I have it again I can choose it from the list instead of rescanning it every time. Has all the nutritional values on display. You can set personal goals for macros consumed. This will show you where you're at each day (provided you track your foods with the app) this is all in the free version too! Great addition to your health equipment. Recommend for sure!!",system requirement,5,,
Gregory Wright,Functional,"It can keep track of all calories, in (assuming you enter them) and out (assume you enter them). One great ""plus"" - I used a different app in the past, but this one has a bigger database of foods w/ product codes (to which you can add), and it doesn't automatically slap on the current time. Of course improvements could be made, but that's true of anything. Send the word, and update is their tool.",New feature,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Pretty legit way to keep track of nutrient intake. Personally I'm trying to gain weight, and it helps make sure I am eating enough, on a continuous basis. Also, at the same time it is giving reminders about certain deficits of important nutrients (protein) or warnings about specific surpluses at unhealthy levels (sodium, fats) Cant speak to the premium version, as I haven't tried it yet.",system requirement,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Outstanding app. Really helping me to stay on track with weight loss and fitness goals. So simple to use yet so very helpful in balancing energy in vs energy out.

Love that other fitness apps feed into it, populating the appropriate fields for clear tracking.",New feature,5,,
Chris Roop,Functional,"Keeping a food log is the best way to impact your eating behavior. I've done it manually but it isn't sustainable. Good data comes from consistent input. The app not only makes it possible, it reminds you when you forget or get busy. The more I use it the more ways I find to make it easier. There are actions that have a learning curve and places that can be improved, but that will happen and in the meantime I'm generating significant data that will help me in the long term.",New feature,5,"Hi Chris, thank you for contacting us and for using MyFitnessPal - we are truly honored to be a part of your health and fitness journey.

A Google user,Functional,"Most important for me in a fitness/weight loss app is ease of use, because if it's too complicated, I know I'm going to give up on it. I love that it allows you to build a recipe of your own for a complete meal that serves 8, and then allows you to choose just one serving for yourself. The only thing that bugs me is that I've synched the fitness tracker thing that came preloaded on my phone, but for some reason, it doesn't transfer my steps. That's an really minor issue, though.",New feature,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"* Makes meal, calorie and macronutrient tracking a breeze. * I especially love that I can save a meal when I put one together that really helps me meet my goals. * I haven't yet encountered a food that wasn't found in the lookup interface; and even when my search term doesn't yield an immediate result, the built in barcode scanner works perfectly. * Interface is smooth, haven't had any technical issues at all.",system requirement,5,,
William Berry,Functional,"So far, so good. I use it for the calorie tracking. Which has been the most helpful to me. The other aspects are ok. It's social aspects are also lacking, but I'm actually fine with that. As the calorie tracking is my primary use. Adding ones exercises is lacking, as I use machines only at my gym and this app doesn't support enough machine options for me. So yeah, great calorie tracking, only ok on everything else. Still love it.",system requirement,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Free version is still pretty much feature complete. Very extensive index of foods. Scanning is easy. If you're tracking macros this should be your default tool. If you're making food yourself you can save recipes. If you're eating out at local places it's definitely harder to track, but you can make custom foods with estimates if you need to.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"I used this app several years ago and tried to use a few others before coming back to this one. Compared to other apps, this one shows a lot more nutritional data for free, which I love! It is very easy to log what I eat and see how I can change my diet to meet my personal eating goals. I had initially switched apps because I wanted something more nutrition focused, rather than calorie focused, but this has ended up being the best of both.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A Google user,Functional,"Very happy with app. It has been beneficial in helping me understand the delicate balance between calories and exercise. Reviewing nutrition data helped me to adjust food portions and seasonings. Not always a simple task to find exact food portions. I occasionally have to research online. Overall, it is much better than one other app I tried.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Kelly Bradley,Functional,"Great app, I only have the free version because I just can't afford to pay for it monthly. However, if I did, I definitely would, as all the paid features look great.

Jackline Mwanza,Functional,Great for tracking calories precisely. Has a large database of food but what stands out most for me is the inclusion of indeginous foods and some are even verified.

Ken Cooper,Functional,"Since the redesign, it is very difficult to know the battery percentage on a Charge5 as it was removed from the pull down sync. It is too small to see without magnification on the watch face and only shows high, medium, or low on the device settings page.

Sleep tracking doesn't even account for time changes. Did anyone this test before release?",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Kimberly D,Functional,"Update, further downgrading my review. Not a fan of the new interface. Been using Fitbit for years, but this new interface makes me think about switching. Colors are dull.

I've tried all the usual (& Fitbit support recommended) methods of getting it to sync which occasionally works for that one instance, but then it doesn't sync again unless I redo everything again. There shouldn't have to be this much effort to sync to the app. I'd be better off tallying my steps throughout the day.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
James Tiernan,Functional,"The app used to be decent. Now it won't sync properly. When I click the help button it takes me to a uselessly generic page listing the things that ""could be"" but aren't wrong. I used to love this app. Also, I strongly dislike the last update.

D Hazen,Functional,"Not a fan. Recent app updates are much less user friendly. More complicated to view exercise and zone minutes by week, look and feel of home screen is too tough to read because of the lack of color for separation and grouping, too much white space with no definition, etc. In prior version could easily click on a specific stat from home screen (e.g., zone minutes) and then use tabs to easily navigate from day to week to month. Please bring back something more like the prior version!",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Matthew Clark,Functional,New update is garbage. Not intuitive at all. I find it only tracks 1 exercise per day. When I go for a run it will not calculate my entire distance. Most of my runs are missing 1 mile in the activity even though it shows an accurate lap count. Not sure why the update occurred but it is complete garbage. Having to scroll through multiple days to compare exercises Is not easy nor is it an upgrade from previous version. I am strongly considering tossing this in the garbage.,FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Gabbie K,Functional,"New update is so ugly! Stuff is harder to navigate and it displays less information by default. Wish we had the option to change it back. Moved all of my data that I was tracking daily to different, more inconvenient locations. Display is just boring. Recent update is buggy as heck. My versa 3 keeps disconnecting, app won't update stats, forgets my device, etc. I've tried all of the suggested troubleshooting. Revert the darn app back to how it was!!

Ginger Watson,Functional,"As an additional followup after your response-I had already read the article & my location services were previosly set at 'while in use' (for several years) & I was able to swipe sync prior to this update. Not impressed with the look of the latest update-please go back to the previous version. Also, you shouldn't need location set to 'always' to sync - change it back.

Calicko,Functional,I do not care for the new update. I really hate this constant updating and changing. I understand some things need improvement but changing the entire app is not always the answer. Now multiple data views don't work properly. Seems harder to read and navigate with the more monotone look they now provide. Also have more issues with syncing since the update. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Update: Due to the most recent update the app does not show battery percentage anywhere.,FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Metal Chris,Functional,"On the latest update active zone minutes are displayed on the first screen only. They don't show up in the weekly screen. Even though I pass 22 active zone minutes per day, and it does show a breakdown of activities with active zone minutes, the app shows no exercise days. Only improvement is the sync is faster than it used to be. And still, all these years later, with many users asking for it - still no dark mode!!",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Jean Vilmenay,Functional,The most recent version doesn't sync! Turns out the last update changed my permissions settings and didn't bother to let me know. It wasn't syncing because it no longer had permission.

Vadim Panfilov,Functional,"food tracking is a joke, almost impossible to use. food search produces too many results, no way to star enries to be able to find them later. previously tracked food goes to recent and frequent tabs. sort order and content in those tabs changes all the time, there is no way to search there, can't remove unwanted entries. items go missing. the only ""usable"" feature- barcode scanning, but it often returns wrong items or it does not recognize barcode at all so you have to try 3-4 times.",New feature,1,,
Jim Pott,Functional,"Not a good app. Just moved from Apple to Samsung phone and Fitbit. The Inspire 2 band is garbage for so many reasons, but wouldn't stop tracking for over 5 minutes because stopping the Inspire is a chore.

Over and over again.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
SUSAN BURLINGAME,Functional,"Horrible! Should have left well enough alone. The home page is a disaster. My profile picture is gone and no amount of reloads, reinstalling the app, restarting my phone has rectified the issue. I can't understand who at fitbit thought this was a good idea.

Drew Nelson,Functional,"GOOGLE IS SPYING ON US!! The new update will not allow you to sync the app until you give them permission to track your location even when the app is not running. So basically your phone is always transmitting your location 24/7. Not to mention what ever else they are now collecting. Just the battery usage alone is enough to say no thanks. Sending my Ionic back for the refund, and deleting the app. I think they made it look bad so you won't notice the major invasion of privacy.",Security Requirements,1,,
Maureen Ahern,Functional,"HATE>>>HATE>>>HATE THIS UPDATE. It's not user-friendly. Getting to specific data is a pain.

What was the point of doing this change? I can't even track my exercise! The graphs only show stats within an hour range, not actual times as Ã¬t did a few releases ago. Fitbit not the prize it used to be. Bummer. Yes, I too am looking at iWatch now.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Nathan Tripp,Functional,"The app works great for the most part. The biggest issue that even though the app tracked my location perfectly when doing a walk (the route on the map is perfect).

Why does the app not use the gps data for distance?",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Renee Kostner,Functional,"Held off reviewing hoping they'd realize how terrible this update is. Previous version was a lot better. Can no longer check battery level from app. New app wastes too much space on the home page so one can't see things easily at a glance. Can't customize as much. Can no longer see Friends as easily. Also, the app still can't handle daylight savings time--even after all these years the app still can't get sleep right. Please, please ditch this version. The old one was so much better!",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,

Now it's pale blue text on white, spread out so you have to scroll to find even the basics, the ""dashboard"" has only 3-4 layout options - all bad, and they removed the battery life percentage indicator from the top front to generic word descriptions 2-3 menus deep.

Sharli Grove,Functional,"I've been greatly disappointed with fitbit over the past year. Last winter, they discontinued the challenges. I actually found great motivation in those.

Jonathan Smith,Functional,"The old version had a display for battery level on the main screen so I knew when to charge my watch. The new version does not. So now my watch dies before I know it needs to be recharged. The old version displayed all exercise separated by week with an indicator of heart rate zones. Very useful. The new version makes you click each log entry to see heart rate zone minutes. Worse, you have to scroll week by week then select the specific log entry. Useless. I also have to turn my watch off and",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Katt Ness,Functional,"If you forget to wear it and try to add exercise, it only allows you to enter whole numbers. If you walk a mile and a half, you can only enter 1 OR 2 miles. Not 1.5 miles. And you can't save unless you enter calories burned. How am I supposed to know that number? I wasn't wearing my Fitbit! Lastly, the sleep report is useless, unless you can compare REM with wakeup. Why even have it?? I've been meaning to replace Fitbit with a better smart watch. Thanks for the push. Fitbit can't be trusted.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,"Hey, Katt. We're sorry to hear this.

Sue Leinberger,Functional,"Why do they ""fix"" what isn't broken? I'm joining the one star review club - the update is NOT an improvement. Scrolling and searching for all the info that was easy to find previously. When I start tracking a workout on the (fully charged )device it starts ok but then quits and screen goes blank. When I put it on the charger it shows that it's charged, when I restart the device it shows a much lower percentage charged.

Patti Stoneham,Functional,"As others have stated, Fitbit is great but the ""fresh new look"" leaves a lot to be desired. Colors are ill-defined and data is hard to read. Nowhere on the home screen can you see the percent charge remaining - or on the next screen either. This new design has definitely curbed my enthusiasm for using the info.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Kina Sakuraba,Functional,"Fitbit Premium is twice as much money for a service that was half as good as Fitbit Coach. It's very disappointing that they got rid of Coach and didn't at least move the workouts to there, I loved all the guided outdoor walks the most. They let me play my own music while a trainer told me when to speed up or slow down. I got to try Premium, my music didn't get turned down while they talked & it was an audio mess. Coach was a better service. Challenges are gone now. Now it's ugly and generic.",New feature,1,,
Kevin Gilyard,Functional,"I'm on at least my 5th watch. And the most you can get out of these watches is a year and half at the most. The app is good the idea is great, but the technology just isn't there. The watch faces pop out. The bands are awful. My versa 2 just died for no reason, just keeps resetting. It's a known issue that they won't address. My new watch will definitely be a new brand",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Anne Koiv,Functional,"The latest update re-ordered the various section trackers to different places. Since I only care about a few of them, the new format is not easily accessed for me. The old order was better. If there was a way to re-order the sections to better suit each individual, it would be much more useful. The Sleep monitor has never been accurate.

I realize I can see what I've burned and what I've consumed but that still doesn't tell me the estimated amount left for the day.

I love the old fitbit interface, clean, compact, and providing data in a way that's easy to read while remaining comprehensive.

Grace Redden-Tamblyn,Functional,"I loathe the most recent update. The app now crashes on startup unless it is the only thing running on my phone. When it does open, it does not sync my steps. The ""updated"" colors, graphs, and UI design are all less useful and less intuitive than they were before. The colors on the graphs are so close as to be impossible to distinguish.

Tony Zapien,Functional,The new update is horrible. It's non intuitive and missing a bunch of basic features that the previous version had. Simple things like watch battery level are gone. Heart rate zone is gone. The UI is also bigger and there is no color. You have to scroll to find information that before was right on the screen and the functionality is slow. It looks like a website from the 90s.,New feature,1,,
Julie Kirkwood,Functional,"The new app is terrible. They upgraded us with no warning and no way to revert. I lost all my customization. Everything reset. The features I've been using daily are gone. Can't edit the fitbit-detected type of exercise, so it thinks l was mountain biking when I mowed the lawn and there's no way to change it. If I manually enter exercise, it doesn't show heart rate or zones, just the bare minimum of data. It takes extra clicks to enter weight. Why would they do this???",New feature,1,,
Glenda Sublett,Functional,"Since my app updated last night, I keep getting a Mobile Track sync notification. Everything is syncing fine, but the notification won't go away. I've checked the battery setting. It is set to Unrestricted, so that is not the problem. I definitely prefer the previous version over the new version. The new design is awful. The white is too much. I liked the colors and function before this update. It was much easier to use and find what I was looking for.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,,
Meg S,Functional,"Latest update is awful! The app was the best thing about fitbit. Not anymore. They've removed significant customization options. Instead of being able to individually pick what stats you want on the dashboard you chose a ""focus"" and those 4 stats are at the top. You cannot hide, change, or rearrange any of the 4 things that are displayed as part of the focus, only toggle on or off the things that aren't in the focus group.

Bree Z.,Functional,"I used to love this app, but since the redesign I've been extremely unhappy. (And for the record, everyone I've spoken to about it feels similarly.) The overall look is unsatisfying, but the main issue is that you can't see the battery percentage from the app. It doesn't even show when it is actively charging! This is wildly inconvenient. Frankly, it should also tell you how long until a full charge, just like most cell phones do when they are charging. You have the ability to make this right.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,

Bob Bray,Functional,The new app is not nearly as functional as the previous version. The zone exercise does not break down fat burn and cardio data like the previous version.

The muted colors remove the enthusiasm I had for checking data, the design is less intuitive, and the functionality seems to work less well.

Maia,Functional,"What was the point of this update. The colors aren't vibrant. The zone colors on the graphs are not accessible since there's not enough contrast between it. The colors before were intuitive with red, orange, yellow, and blue. The quick view on the home screen is less detailed. There's not even a dark mode. I'm fact it's even brighter than before.

Erich von Hauske,Functional,"Pretty UI at the expense of ease of use. the latest version requires a lot more effort to view your history for a metric, to the point that it is not usable.

I was going to buy a new watch but I'll wait until this is fixed.",New feature,2,,
Sharon Trammell,Functional,"I've had more problems with this app since the last update than the previous versions. It's slow to sync and count my steps. Sometimes, it even shows zero steps after I've walked a few thousand steps. I've had to uninstall and re-install several times just to get the app to sync properly. Also, I liked the way the previous versions showed if the battery was low. I liked knowing the percentage rather than ""low,"" ""medium,"" etc. I'm not very pleased with the app's latest update.

Fran Heddings,Functional,"I've used this app for many years and loved it, until the recent update. The home screen UI isn't user-friendly. The battery level no longer displays, the icons and labels take up too much space, and other essential functionality has been removed or degraded.

John Wickham,Functional,"Oct 2023 app redesign is a huge step backwards. What happened to the battery percentage that was always available and showed in the sync? Now users have to take multiple steps just to get an approximate battery level... Ridiculous. Asthecally it does look cleaner. The UX asks the user to ""prioritize"" what they'd like to see which could be useful for some. Not for me. It wasn't very difficult to scroll down a bit to see what wasn't on top or tap for details.",New feature,2,,
C. Thomas,Functional,"This latest upgrade is terrible. It misses syncing portions of the activities. For example, it did not sync the last segment of my sleep or the last segment of the hourly activity. It is difficult to read and needs too many steps to get to the information I want.

Brittany Wolf,Functional,"When I first downloaded the app, it was fantastic, and I didn't have any issues. After this most recent update and change, my steps on the app vs. what my watch says are not matching up. A lot of my stats are not accurate after this recent update, and it's frustrating.

Robin Stillwater,Functional,"I got a fitbit because people rave about them, so I figured it was worth a little extra money. Unless something big changes, I definitely will not be getting another. Mild issues with the screen being too dim, but mostly issues with the app. It takes literal minutes to sync, up to 5 minutes, sometimes it won't sync at all, and now with the newest update it's saying it requires background location services to sync even though it actually doesn't.

Nicholas Harrison,Functional,"Not working well since the update Ok, so the update is very minimalist in terms of color and that isn't appealing for me, but the real issue is not only does it seem like it stopped synching in the background with my watch, there are times when it just fails to synch at all. Again, not an issue before the update so I don't think it's a hardware thing. My watch is less than a year old. I do like the custom dashboard with goals, and the disappearance of the ""tips"" that were unnecessary.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi, Nicholas Sorry to hear this but thanks for your feedback.

Jerry Ham,Functional,"This design refresh is bad (for example you cannot put the items you want into the order that you want, you can only move groups that are, within themselves, order locked. This means more scrolling to see what you want. Also, for some reason, the heart rate panel won't even open. Tapping the icon brings up a screen that just clocks forever. All in all, needed some people who actually use it to tell the designers to go back to the drawing board. it is clearly put together by folks that don't use.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Amber Abernathy,Functional,This new update is not great. Harder to read and screaming white. There is no good reason not to have a dark mode. I'll give back the other two stars when there's a dark mode option. You also can't check battery life on the app anymore. That was a convenient feature to check on while it was charging or when you're exercising and can't check it on the band. ***Update: the GPS is also now consistently over one mile short.

Jeannette Hill,Functional,"A problem that has carried over from the older app version is that after I sync, I have to close out the app and open it again for any steps that were synced to show up in the graphs. After the most recent update, location services must be enabled all the time in order to sync with the Fitbit. It was much better before, when I could enable it only while using the app. When it comes time to replace my Fitbit, I will be checking out other options if this is still required.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi, Jeannette.

David Cammack,Functional,"The new Fitbit app look is worse. This seems to be a trend with most products, especially software--over time, they get worse. The metrics are dull and harder to distinguish. The dashboard is comprehensively less informative, and the color scheme is more bland. While I Iike the increased functionality (which is why I gave it 2 stars), I'd rather have the old look back.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Lee Martin,Functional,"I'm very disappointed in this new revision. I have been actively using Fitbit since 2012, and this is the biggest jump backward so far. My primary areas of concern are colors, font size, GPS mapping, and the ability to organize screens to meet my needs. I was afraid that acquisition by Google was going to be a hostile takeover and these ""improvements"" seem to support this theory.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Mike Lieder,Functional,"App redesign is alright once you get used to it, but doesn't seem necessary and isn't an improvement on what was there. It also took away the ability to edit an exercise type after. For instance, it automatically records me mowing the lawn as mountain biking. Before I could just edit that and everything was fine, but now you can't even edit this.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
A Ronan,Functional,"Not a fan of the newest release. The design looks very dated and less polished than the previous version. The battery percentage doesn't show now which is just silly - why would you remove a critical piece of info from the main screen? I also loved seeing my total steps for the week and while it's still available it's much less prominently featured. I'm not opposed to change, but I don't see any improvement with this overhaul. It's only made it look silly and taken away things I liked.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Julie F (JulieNStLouie),Functional,"The latest app update messed up my fitbit inspire 2. The new version wants to to sync with Google. It will no longer pair on Bluetooth. It shuts down often and no longer syncs my data. I tried to chat with Fitbit, and they couldn't figure out what was wrong (3 different people). They left me out in the cold. I am very disappointed.

Anna L,Functional,"Another big update that doesn't help. They changed the color scheme for heart rate zones in maps and charts to a muted, ugly design that makes it harder to differentiate between zones.

Sherry Oldham-Coffee,Functional,I loved the old version. This new updated version isn't as good. They need to bring back a lot of the old features. I want the little graph that showed what my heart rate did while exercising back instead of a generic plain number telling me how many zone minutes and nothing else. I like being able to see how my heart was responding to each exercise. I use a rowing Machine quite frequently and now have to look it up each time to log exercise instead of it being easily accessed. New needs work!,FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Mandy B,Functional,"The update to the layout is terrible. I've been using the app to monitor my heart rate during my workouts and now that chart is gone. So is the zone chart.

Doneka D'Amore,Functional,"I hate the new update. I used to get on it several times a day, tracking my food, my water, inputting my workouts if my Fitbit happened to be dead at the time of exercise, checking sleep scores, etc etc. It was inviting, bright, colorful, fun to use, engaging, easy to navigate and explore. Now it's the embodiment of the audio for the Clear Eyes commercial. Looking at the monochromatic dashboard and the new layout sucks the joy right out of me. Why, Fitbit? Why???",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Brandon Farinha,Functional,"Hate the new update. The monochrome style is horrible, it's harder to navigate, and it's not syncing correctly. I did a 3 mile walk this morning and the app is saying i only put in 1.75 despite the fact that the map shows the route taken. Also the new map view is pointless, as it no longer shows mile markers.

Stephanie G,Functional,"I have issues with the latest update. It is harder to see my day at a glance. For exercise days, it's only creating a heartrate graph on autotracked activities & not on manual ones. The colors in the graph are very hard to distinguish now. I can't record as much on certain activities, like miles on the treadmill. The main screen only shows the most recent exercise for the day. I used to be able to swipe through. There's no zone summary for activities or sleep stages on the main screen anymore.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Rachel Eckelberry,Functional,"I used to really enjoy the functionality of this app. Now I can no longer customize my home screen to have zone minutes at the center, I have to drop several layers deep to see my weight loss, and I have to fumble around every time to try to see my workout stats. Because of how cumbersome this is, you're actually driving my traffic to other integrated apps for me to be able to see what I want.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
T Summers,Functional,"What happened to the app? The new user interface is terrible and not user-friendly. The previous cards were perfect, and now it has been ""downgraded"" with a UI that is so sparse and completely unappealing. I don't like that so many features have been taken away.

Judy collier,Functional,"I am not a fan. It is inconsistent and hard to sync.

Elisa Lambert,Functional,"I love this app, but the new redesign is awful. I would have rated four or five stars prior to the change. Some info I used a lot is gone like the heart rate zones chart for a workout. Navigation in general is clunkier and things are a little more burried on the app. Rather than being clean and sleek which I assume was the intended design, it is much harder to see the information since everything blends together. I hope they fix it!",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Michael Vinson,Functional,"This app was great, that is until the latest update. Before you could edit an activity to change the duration and the app would adjust calories, etc. You could change the type of exercise that was automatically detected and it would recalculate based on the new type of exercise. None of that works now. Based on this update, I can no longer recommend getting Fitbit Premium. All of the useful benefits are no longer available.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Robin Swecker,Functional,The app used to give you the option to set silent alarms and change them easily. I have used the alarms daily for years. Now you have to log into a desktop account and dig layers deep to find and change the alarms. Update after Sept 2023 app update. I reduced to 2 stars because the new layout is visually less appealing and harder to customize to what you want to track. Makes me want to switch to a different product.,FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Angela Stevens (Shorti),Functional,"This new design sucks. What was the purpose? Did people ask for these features, or do you just not care what people want? Do the designers actually use the app? It certainly isn't user-friendly. The ability to customize my list of stats is gone. Now, I have to scroll through to find the ones I am looking for. The battery percent is no longer conveniently on the home page. Instead its under devices, and all I get from that is the low medium high? The colors are totally bland and useless.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Janelle A,Functional,"The app just updated with a poorly designed new interface. Design is not intuitive, very accessible, or visually pleasing. It also looks extremely dated now. Additionally, you can see a slew of negative reviews from the past several days as people received this update, complaining about the same things and apparently new functionality issues. Yet the company, without warning is continuing to force it onto users. At least having the option to revert to the previous version would be preferable",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Sovrim Terraquian,Functional,"Wildly inconsistent data updates limit the usefulness of the app. The home screen may list a sleep score but you can't find the details on the sleep tab.

Jil Slegh,Functional,"Not a fan of the new design. AND, the exercise app on my device (Sense) stopped working, all suggestions to fix it were followed but didn't resolve the issue.

I definitely won't purchase another fitbit product.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Rafe S,Functional,"Dark mode! This app needs a dark mode or to not interfere with my phones dark mode.

As soon as I find another fitness watch, I'm out of here! Way to go, Fitbit.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Lori West,Functional,"Hate the new app. Cartoonish, too big, can't see as much on the main screen and what is there is less helpful. Greatly reduced ability to customize what you want to see and where. Beyond that how the data is displayed takes more effort to see what I'm used to seeing, ex steps for the week and prior. I just want my numbers. Looks like a 6 yr old designed the GUI, no offense to 6 yr old budding cartoonists. Adding to the complaint list: Battery level Heart rate - range not actual?!",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Candace,Functional,"This app has so many issues. Your watch will record a run at 3.5 miles and then it shows in the app as 2.18 miles or something, but you'll look at the laps and it shows 3.5 miles, and if you use the share feature it shows 3.5 miles. And yes, this is after you sync, and wait a bit. Other issues- Some days I will check the app and it says I covered 5 miles that day, but show 220,566 steps. You look later and usually it's fixed, but this means basically you cannot trust the app to have useful data.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
JC C,Functional,"It was fine until the 9/23 update. It's so difficult to read the landing page. Sleep not properly calculating. The HR range for the day was nice, but once you sync, it goes away, leaving just the current HR. For those of us watching bradycardia & tachycardia, it would be nice to have. It's not intuitive how to add & change clocks & only allowing 5 options at a time is annoying. No battery life icon, & NO DARK MODE. I'm seriously thinking of switching to a Samsung Galaxy watch after this!",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Cat B,Functional,I agree with all the negative reviews since the redesign. What is wrong with you tech ppl? Why keep trying to fix what isn't broken? Bad design so user unfriendly. Don't need workout 'suggestions'. Why can't I change anything on the main page/main circle anymore? I want miles to be my focus not steps. Too many clicks to see what you need to see anymore. Interestingly the old version is still on my tablet. So I will refer to that as much as possible. Go back to the previous version that worked!,FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Molly Doster,Functional,"I love the old version of this app... The newest update is absolutely terrible. My Fitbit can no longer sync with the app (steps, calories burned, ect.) And the color layout of the app is confusing now. It also doesn't show my food intake overview unless I click on the actual tile, same with the water. Sometimes it doesn't save food or water that is added. I don't understand what the point of this update was....",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi, Molly. This is definitely not an experience we want you to have. We already identified the cause of the issue and users should now have a normal experience in the app again. But if you're still having trouble syncing or logging in, please don't hesitate to contact us on our help page here: https://goo.gle/contactfitbit",
A Google user,Functional,"I have found the update to have major issues with randomly recording activities inaccurately. Case in point: yesterday a period of time was recorded as being idle and shows no steps taken. In reality, I was walking down aisles in a grocery store and taking steps the entire time. This is not the first time actively has been missed. I have set up auto recording for activity and since the update, the activity has been missed at random on a number of occasions. Very disappointing.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Qiana Washington,Functional,"The update no longer allows you to edit the exercise when the Fitbit automatically detects it. So, if it thinks I was walking but I was really horseback riding, I can no longer correct that. The updated interface is also challenging to navigate but not impossible. App needs work or should revert back to the old format.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Henry Walbesser,Functional,"Just got the latest version and the downgrade is interesting. Most app look to improve as they go. I see Fitbit has gone another way. The new dashboard looks like a first project by a grade schooler. Most of the under features are still there but now I can only have 4 metrics on the focus where I had 5 previously. The crisp icons and lines are gone, replaced with cartoon like ones. It still serves its purpose but a rollback option would nice.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,

Ruth Collins,Functional,"I've always really liked the app, but I really don't like the new interface. It used to be really visually appealing, but not anymore. I'm guessing that's to entice you to pay for a premium subscription. If the premium app is as bland, I definitely wouldn't pay for it.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,

Gerardo Leal,Functional,"I used to love this app. But the new redesign is simply terrible and removes functionality..I use it on a pixel phone and cannot longer rename workouts ..this means I am stuck only with the few preset quick access ones and cannot rename.them climbing when I climb for example...they stay as ""workout"". I cannot think of a single thing that improved and I can think of many that became worst...is one of those redesign for the sake of redesign.Sad.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Teresa,Functional,Hate the new look. Way less customizable. Way worse data. Now you don't get a breakdown of the minutes your zone time is in just the hour which is not helpful at all. Sleep has less detailed information. Did they put all these features into premium or are they just making at all shittier?,FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Tina Galler,Functional,"I hate the new fit bit app. I have a hard time navigating all parts of the app. I have to dig to find my steps.I have to dig to find my sleep score,etcetera.

My watch also doesn't keep a full charge for very long.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Martyn Alderman,Functional,Every time I stop at a coffee shop when cycling it loses its GPS connection and shuts off GPS. There should be a way to restart the GPS when you leave the building.

Lance Beloungie,Functional,"The recent change to Fitbit is very irritating. Now, the history has change to average (for example -steps) . Previously, I compared to how I've done. Now, it doesn't give that information for comparison. It doesn't give the total steps for the week. For sleep, you don't get the information when you ask for it. To find the rem daily, you have to press two screens before finding what you want. You give less information and less friendly access than previously.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,

Tracy Doeppers,Functional,"Works well for tracking steps & weight. But the sleep tracking is truly frustrating. At least 1-2/wk, it doesn't track sleep, so i have no metrics. I'm not doing anything different, so there's no good reason for this. It also has trouble detecting when sleep starts, & I have to edit at least once/wk.

It won't sync up independently since the most recent update and doesn't allow active communication with my phone for notifications. UPDATE: Hopefully, this helps others.

I have to connect to the charger. Also the food log is not user friendly, very hard to locate the foods you commonly eat.

I love my fitbit... when it works! So frustrating.",system requirement,3,,
Geoff K,Functional,"Updated new app version fall 2023. Don't like it, old version was better. I liked being able to see great rare graph during exercise and track heart rate by minute. Nor picking up exercise automatically there way it did before (misses about 40-50%), then when adding exercise manually to log, sometimes doesn't connect exercise info to it (calories, heart rate, etc). The UI is generic and bleh. They took away information from the user.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Norm Bryan,Functional,"The update is suboptimal; that is, it is less developed than what it replaced. It no longer tracks pulse rate nor the resting rate thus losing for me an important function. Update Thank you, Fitbit, for the response but it does not address the app, rather it addresses the fitbit device. The device tracks pulse; the app which syncs to the device does not, nor does it provide such as an option.

Adrian Nicholls,Functional,"It's ok but the latest update appears to have removed battery percentage charged with low/medium/high which is not nearly as useful. I spent ages re-arranging the screen to how I like it and there seems no benefit to me. Meh, if I had to do this every time a phone app updated I'd have no time for anything else. Fast iteration CI/CD is ok in software development but it needs to add value too, not just cause hassle.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Reid Buyaky,Functional,"Update is horrible. It no longer maps my exercise or recognizes activity. Every fitness entry must be entered manually. If these features (including GPS) are still available it's testimony to how awful the changes were, as they can't be easily found. Please bring them back. Added: Right after submitting my review I returned to the app and found I could transfer my account to Google. After doing this, I found where to start and map exercise. Other features may further change my review.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Shaquille John,Functional,"- Last review, the data wasn't correct across countries & Time zones but that seems to be fixed. - New Update doesn't reflect on most of the pages, so it's strange to see nice graphics then the old design for everything else... hopefully that's fixed soon",New feature,3,,
Tobi Ling,Functional,"I have a Charge 4. Since upgrading to the latest version of the app, sleep information is fully captured about every other night.

Jonna Quigg,Functional,"The app was decent. Now it has lost a star after this redesign. The new redesign is not friendly. Yes, you can customize the snapshot which is nice, but it's all white background is unpleasant and now i have to search and click several times to find the info I want. I prefer the ""cards"" and an easy-to-read layout. Also, I would like to see the ability to track my blood pressure in the app, either by manual entry or BT from my monitor/app (similar to what's savailable for glucose monitoring).",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Alexandrea Brown,Functional,"The app was fairly easy to use prior to the most recent update. I like that they've included a menstrual health tab now and made the video workouts page easier to filter through and find what you need. However, most things were oversimplified to the point that everything looks exactly the same and it's really overwhelming to look at. Especially when you're trying to look at the breakdown of your zone minutes for the day or week. It used to have a clear differentiation between sections. Not a fan",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
David Morgan,Functional,"New user interface is not great. A recent update has rearranged all my data and changed the icons for each category. The new look is also not very asthetocally pleasing.

David Smith,Functional,"Down one star. Since the ""upgrade"" I can no longer view the level of charge on my watch. This is useful while it's charging and not on my wrist. For future reference, putting the same old information with lots of white space around it isn't actually an improvement. All the underlying screens that produce the information on the main screen are unchanged so no true improvement has occurred.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
A Louise,Functional,"Used to like the app, since the latest update though I do not. I definitely prefer the old look where it showed the zones you did in a bar graph and was easy to see and chart everything. The latest update made everything way more complicated with less info than before. Hopefully, they listen to all the complaints and revert it back or find a good median between the two. If not, I will most likely end up uninstalling.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Monica Price,Functional,"The new app format needs to include the watch's charge. That used to show when it synced. And it needs dark mode. I love this watch. (It is glitchy and inaccurate.) And it would have 5 stars except that I bought it because of all of the features. Yet some of those features were not described as only being available with a premium subscription. I spent a lot of money for this thing and I'm supposed to pay more for the features I bought it for? Not just more, but monthly more. Not cool.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Martin Tubens,Functional,I updated the fibit app and now I can no longer see the battery charge level on the app. Originally you would pull down the screen and it will sync revealing the progress of battery charge. Well that no longer is available. That was a feature I really liked but it's no longer there unless I'm missing it. Developers please bring this feature back. Thanks,FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Rick Kissel,Functional,"After the upgrade I cannot find the battery percent of my sense. This was important while the watch was charging. I was hoping the update would fix the graphs, and go back to the previous graphs prior to July 2022 when you could expand the graphs and give you more options. This was really just a cosmetic update with some functionality removed. I don't see any functionality added.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Steve Sorenson,Functional,"Not a fan of the new layout. Seems solely like change for change's sake. One thing that got lost in the ""update"" is the battery status. Used to be able to see the percentage full in the progress bar during a refresh. Not any more.

Emma Lockard,Functional,"The new look in the home screen/dashboard is so blah! Not liking how everything is one color. Makes it SUPER difficult to see the different categories and tracking features.

I don't like how it thinks when I sit down to read that I am sleeping and counts that as sleeping.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Lee Ludlam,Functional,"This new version doesn't show the battery charge on my charge 5 without going into the settings, whereas it used to be on the main screen when you refreshed the page or synced the app. Put it back on the main page, please!

Things like the map for walks/runs and heart rate during the activity as well.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Destiny Frost,Functional,"Yeah I appreciate Fitbit trying to finally update the UI after all of these years but I feel like it went in the wrong direction. I think the reason why it feels harder to read is because all of the components have the same color whereas before different components had their own colors and look to them. It is now too bland and a hard adjustment to get used to. I say give us the option to let users customize the colors on our UI, I think that would be a big help.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Heather Foliart,Functional,"In theory it's great. In practice, every update breaks it. I end up having to completely uninstall and reinstall each time because the watch, app and/or phone (any combo of all three) messes up and won't properly communicate.

Every update to Fitbit app breaks it.",Security Requirements,3,,

Am I just missing it in the update? Can I revert back to the old version? Not a fan of the new graphics either. If your new ""battery level"" is accessed by the icon in the upper left, then tapping my device (inspire hr) it has shown ""medium"" for 3 days, no indication of percentage.

Brandon Houck,Functional,"The new aesthetic looks nice. However, I miss being able to see my total monthly steps on the Year tab. Yes, I can do math and convert average daily to monthly, or I can scroll back through dozens of previous months one by one, but I would like this feature back to remove the tedium from the new UX. Total steps are more important to me than average daily. To cater to everyone, just show both in all cases.",New feature,3,,
Phil Tuton,Functional,"I have been using Fitbit trackers for man years. I went through the terrible goole transition and ended up buying the new Charge 5. I'm happy with my new 5. However, the new application is poor. I had better control of the application in the previous version. I like being able to see the metrics important to me up front. In my case, they're sleep, heartrate, and glucose. I really miss not having a fitbit battery percentage of charge displayed. This design really needs an improved UI.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Ashley Millette,Functional,"The app is wildly glitchy. It doesn't consistently prompt me to calibrate my run distance, and if I try to modify it in the app after the fact, it throws an error that the distance is invalid if I try to give it a decimal, ie, 3.1, gives no error if I submit a full number, ie, 3 miles, but then it also doesn't update the actual workout with that value after saving.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
C Moore,Functional,"I love the app and the insight it provides but I really don't like the new UI at all. It's unusual for me to have anything but good things to say about Google or Fitbit.

I subtracted two stars and I'm hoping this UI can be refined in short order.",New feature,3,,
Deb Durant,Functional,"The last update looks pretty but it has removed features that I found helpful. I can't change my clock face since the ""gallery"" option doesn't seem to find the internet - although I am connected both by wi-fi and cellular; and it does not show my battery charge level. The numbers on my Charge 3 are small and faint. I had hoped to change the clock face in hopes that the battery level would be more visibile but I can't do that either. I need to change my device - and it won't be a Google product.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Christopher Hudson,Functional,"The app does a lot of things well, like the exercise tracking. It's nice to have the built in calorie counter. Unfortunately, if there's ever a problem, the support is worthless. The heart rate tracker doesn't work well for me and the UI is not intuitive. Also having to pay a monthly subscription is a real bummer.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Dakota,Functional,"New theme is uninspiring. Color scheme is depressing with no alternative options or way to revert to older version. User Interface has also become less clear to navigate as there is less distinction between features. All together the app feels as though it has taken a step backwards in usability and lost it's flare. On a positive note, the functionally of the band and various features of the app operate fine.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
dlstanf2,Functional,"No Street Names on Map What's happening with the street names on my GPS map? Had no issues previously. Have the Charge 6. How am I supposed to keep up with my walks/runs when I take different routes. Now I do like many other things about the Charge 6 compared to the Charge 5. The side button makes it easier to ensure I put my band on correctly, rather right side up. Haven't tried all the features yet. I'm sure I will like those. Just Google Maps without street names... that's hust not right.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
robert mallik,Functional,Not very intuitive. Battery indicator has vanished so have to go to look on watch while charging. And the map in the activity tile no longer shows street names.

michel hanna,Functional,"The app has been lately much better overall. However, for the past 5 months it's a totally different story. I had to remove my watch every few weeks otherwise the app won't sync with it. Many times the app will override the old values of my exercise and push it on my watch, deleting the last better numbers. It sounds like cutting cost is finally paying dividends at goog.

Kort Sandberg,Functional,"I was very disappointed with the latest Google UI updates (9/27/23) to Fitbit app. Using it days later is still very frustrating.

Just change it back, the way it was worked fine, please.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
ann sawyer,Functional,I like using this to track my activity and sleep. But the update that hit this week has a disappointing feature: it no longer shows the battery charge level.

Goat of Music,Functional,"Sometimes Extremely Slow and far Too Many Updates. This app is slow to sync when doing it manually(usually when it doesn't do it itself, which happens often) and will take exceedingly long to sync or sometimes not even sync at all.

I wish there was an option to download the old layout because I do not like this new one. Also it has issues syncing and half the time I have to wait for it to get the updated info from my watch.,FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Kevin Moore,Functional,"I initially thought this app was stripped of features (map, splits, etc.) when updated as a means to push people towards purchasing fitbit premium. Upon learning that doesnt appear to be the case, hanlon's razor comes to mind: ""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."" This update is absolutely terrible. Addendum: It seems that they are listening. Maps, pace, and other features have been restored. Room for improvement. Rating changed.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Kevin Sanchez-Cherry,Functional,"It is good, but I don't like that it deletes data randomly. Other times it doesn't synch with other devices and I have to manually enter it. I tried those and it does not help. I am running Android 12 on my Samsung Galaxy. Just today I deleted an entry I put in last night because it didn't synch.

Jen,Functional,"I am SO disappointed with this new interface! Why, oh why, do developers ""fix"" things that aren't broken?! I love my Fitbit, but the prior interface offered clarity, showed everything at a glance, and yet was still fully customizable.

I am constantly having to sync the app with my watch in order to have the watch function properly. I also have a red dot on my app, indicating a notification.

Evans,Functional,I expect better from a device that cost 160$ plus whose premium features require a monthly membership and that is now owned by Google. It's supposed to detect workouts. For example I hopped on a bike. It self registered it as a sport. Can I change it to bicycle no. I did yoga for an hr. Did it register it; no. Same for a nap I took. I had to put it in myself. And my new charge 6 wouldn't work unless I updated my app to the Google version. Which in my opinion is cluttered and not streamlined.,FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hi, Evans. Sorry to hear. SmartTrack recognizes an exercise that lasts at least 15 minutes based on the continuous movement of your arms and the intensity. If your activities aren't recognized, lowering the time auto-exercise recognition setting to 10 minutes may help. For further assistance, reach us at: https://goo.gle/contactfitbit",
Theresa Maher,Functional,"The update is awful. Not only from a design perspective and user interface, but it seems to be now buggy. For instance today there's no heartbeat at all, I've had issues with the sink It worked about six out of 10 times today. No matter how many times I've added water it does not reflect anything being added. I hope you didn't put a lot of money into this latest update because it kind of sucks.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Gene Jestice,Functional,"Started with the charge 2 in August and really love it! My sleep quality has improved and I've discovered that I walk 5 to 10 miles every day doing chores around the farm! UPDATE 9/29/23 changed my 5 star review to 3 stars for the new ""update"".

Naomi Cahill,Functional,"New design is definitely not my favorite. I'm a runner, and I love being able to see my heart rate zones from my runs. Well with the new color scheme, they all look the same.

Kathryn L,Functional,"Doesn't always pick up my walks, and active minutes, but overall good. Update 2022: Walks and active minutes detection is now working very well.

Rebecca Kroes,Functional,I don't like the update it all looks the same. The foods for calorie tracking need major improvement. WW has way better scanning options and actually matches the nutritional facts labels on food. The ones in this app are horribly off a lot!!! Makes it difficult for someone trying to lose weight.,New feature,3,,
Liudmila Maksimovskaya,Functional,"The review is of the new UI only. It is not very user-friendly. Shouldn't there be some difference between different types of records? It looks a bit boring. Do you, guys, want people to use it less? ðŸ™‚ I'm curious to see what the testers say and why would testers find it inspiring and easy-to-use. I feel uninspired when looking at the UI",New feature,3,,
Mike Nelson,Functional,"I have used the Fitbit app now for at least 5+ years & it truly has the potential to be a 5* app. My biggest complaint comes from the food logging part. When you log good, stuff stays in your ""Recent"" tab forever. Items you add recently may or may not appear on the list and if they do, there's no rhyme or reasoning to where they get placed (top, bottom, middle, randomly placed). Recently used items you log should always stay at the top of the list, but this isn't the case. 5* if updated.",system requirement,3,,
Mary Yunger,Functional,"I am most disappointed in the activity/exercise portion of the revised app. When I enter an activity/exercise, like the stationary bike, it no longer shows me the graph with the heartrate zones. Nor does it place the start time 30 min. before my end time. It doesn't even calculate calories like it says it will. It's just more cumbersome and way less informative.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Michael Whitehead,Functional,"The new UI is okay, although I think the previous version was more efficient and quicker to use. I AM missing the battery percentage on this new version, however. (It's so small and hard to read on the device itself.) When the app showed the percentage of battery power remaining, I knew if I had to charge it before I left to start my day, and it would last until I got home.",New feature,3,,
Jim Petrillo,Functional,"I generally like the app, but no dark mode is ridiculous at this point. (How does Fitbit promote sleep? Don't check their app at night!! ) Paying a high monthly premium for innate features is silly. Also I just realized one can't reorder the sequence of apps on a charge 5? Nor delete useless ones. The best feature of a Fitbit is that it's battery lasts a long time. (Not so with pixel watch) The reasons to choose one are fleeting at this point.",New feature,3,,
Candace Harper,Functional,"After about a year, the app quit automatically updating my watch. And yes, Bluetooth is turned on. The time gets behind (PROBLEM, cuz it's a WATCH), the weather won't come up, etc. Even when I manually tell it to sync and update, it won't do it half the time. I won't be replacing this. I'll go back to a reliable AND $10 watch. Thanks anyway.",system requirement,3,,
D.P. Crane,Functional,App seems to work fine. I just have a problem with the food diary portion of the app. It would be helpful if the foods listed were all in alphabetical or some other sensible sort order. If you have quite a few foods in your diary it's really hard to find them if you've saved them or where the app lists them as frequent or recent entries. I'm also having trouble with sleep tracking part of the app. I have to adjust the time that the app inputs on it's own it always wrong.,system requirement,3,"Hi, there.

Jasselle X,Functional,"I've been a Fitbit user for at least 7 years. The app still has so many glitches, and I've been using it less since challenges went away. Disappointing that it seems to be slowly getting worse instead of better. I also wish I could track my individual strength workouts in the app (manually), instead i have a separate app for that. Also the Fitbit premium workouts are so terribly organized and there is NO option to search through the exercises. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!",system requirement,3,,
Brandy Boyd,Functional,"I've been having an issue that has lasted through both of the latest updates, whenever I change time zones, the food/calorie logging feature goes wonky. Doesn't matter if I'm going ahead or back, when I change time zones (or DST), the food logged after the time change is on the next day. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to correct the issue. Nothing else that fitbit support suggested worked. Otherwise, the app is solid.",system requirement,3,,
f hackney,Functional,"My experience with Fitbit has been somewhat underwhelming. I believe it counts steps aggressively. I know within the app there are two different step counts shown with no apparent reasoning. The food log portion of the app is incomplete and the data it accumulates goes nowhere. So, what's the point? The zones and how the zones are determined is very confusing and not clearly defined. I'm using a pixel watch so maybe it's the hardware. If so if be surprised.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Debbie May,Functional,"I am once again trying to get my fitbit to work. Everytime I charge it there is a problem reconnecting to the app. The phone is telling me I need to have an app on my phone. Eventually, I can get it reconnected, but I need to play with it. Occasionally I will lose some functions such as sleep for a few days, and I miss some of the previous activities such as yoga and plates which evidently the programmers don't view as exercise.",system requirement,3,,
Joan Patterson,Functional,"Operating system updated often but instructions are not so it's very hard to get relevant information. For example - the app used to tell me how many steps I took. Now it says how many calories I burned and I cannot change it back. Also, we traveled to Europe. I changed the time gong there but cannot correct it once we returned. I tried several times and was able to change the time - but not to the time where we live.",system requirement,3,,
Michael Page,Functional,"It's ok. An earlier version of the app enabled setting the silent/vibrating alarm from the app. I cannot imagine what motivated the decision to remove that functionality, but I no longer use my fitbit fire an alarm. I would really like it if other forms of exercise were added to the tracker, as well. Edit: two years later, same two main issues - 1. you can't set the alarm from the app, you have to go into the tracker itself, and 2. It doesn't recognize enough forms of exercise.",system requirement,3,,
Mandi Emineth,Functional,"Pros: Good for basic steps and exercise. Had it several years and the battery is still going strong. Cons: doesn't sync on its own.

I have an ad blocker on my phone and it blocks the watch face gallery, so I'm stuck with what I have.",system requirement,3,,
Jordan Cox,Functional,"There is some sort of bug with the Stress Management feature. Each time the feature is attempted on the watch it says, ""Grant permissions in mobile app"" no matter how many times I do just that.

Carmen Byars,Functional,"Updating my review: I don't like the fact that they don't have the challenges anymore, and notifications for emails and text messages are random. Also, there's a 50/50 chance of my screen waking up when I turn my wrist even though I have always on display turned on. And the battery does not last as long as it used to.

Lynn F,Functional,"I wish we didn't have to buy the latest Fitbit for the app to work. My Charge 2 was nice. When it was no longer supported the time became inaccurate. I got a Charge 3 but couldn't see the display in most circumstances. Once I realized I was not going blind but the device was faulty, it was out of warranty. It has been completely black for 2 years, but I wear it to track steps and sleep.",system requirement,3,,
Jenni Dykstra,Functional,"This app is ok but has a bunch of wonky things that make it hard to use easily. Every chart should have a slider so you can see the date or time when, for example your sleep was restless. Logging a hike is really hard because you have to know the distance and exact time. It doesnt work if no internet. Workout charts show how much time since you started, but not time of day... which you really need to edit it (and you always need to edit it). Most premium features are gimmicky. It could be good.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Karen S,Functional,Something is not right with the app when attempting to manually add an exercise. Once the exercise is selected from the list it should go back to allow entry of time started and the length of time in the exercise but it continually snaps back to the screen where you enter the exercise. This is the android version on a Pixel 7. I have cleared the cache and reinstalled the app at least twice.,FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Jeffrey,Functional,"I'm conflicted. I love the detailed information in the app. However, now that the community aspect is gone, it's hard to feel motivated. I loved seeing others losing weight, building muscle, and collecting badges. This loss really changed my perspective of the app. You eliminated a major reason to use this app. I am on the fence now, so I'll give you 3 stars, nothing more.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Rebecca Cronk,Functional,"I LOVED using the Fitbit app for the past 2 years, especially the sleep data for my Charge 3. I believe issues have coincided with my use of the free 3 mo trial of Fitbit Premium, but am not positive. After rebooting the watch, restarting the phone, turning off/on Bluetooth, pairing ""new"" device (which shows up but doesn't completely pair), the watch will sync sometime in that next hour. If I'm lucky, it will sync one more time during the day. It's been like this for weeks.",system requirement,3,,
Shawn Siler,Functional,"It's great except...the lack of gallery tiles for versa 4 can use a LOT of work. There are very few options for my Fitbit and it's a newer model. Every time I seen a tile I wanted, guess what, it didn't work for versa 4. I would've given 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of options to personalize my watch.",New feature,3,,
Jerry Sadler,Functional,"Food logging functionality could use some work. The ""Recent"" tab is very useful but it quickly gets too long and unmanageable because its items are not sorted in any particular order you end up scrolling through hundreds of items. It would be more useful if sorted chronologically or even better, the option of chronological or alphabetical. A search feature that searches exclusively this list would be a great feature as well.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Dan Cooke,Functional,"Upgrade to three stars from one, reluctantly. You can finally change the weight of a food without waiting two minutes. But it is clunky. I don't know if the new owners are serious about this, they just needed to tell shareholders they have watches now. Exercise measurement is okay - less options and not as user friendly as other options out there.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Jenna Speight,Functional,"It syncs well and it's got great analytics. However, the main reason I got a fitbit was to measure my calorie intake/output and the tracker seems to be broken. It always has like 1200 input cals charted for the following day (ex: it's wednesday, so it already says I'm ""over budget"" for thursday). Worse, sometimes it will say that I'm over budget by 500 cals for the current day, but when I add everything I've charted up, it's not matching up. Not great for someone who struggles with undereating.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Yvonne Walker,Functional,"The app is nice but it doesn't have all the functionality I would like. There are things that I do outside the app that I would like to include but can't add accurately like mediations I do or recipes I make.

Patricia Barton,Functional,"Excellent App, easy to navigate. Now that I have been using for awhile, decided to change my rating. I walk for about an hour every morning. When I pick up the pace the app tells me I'm doing elliptical. I turned the elliptical feature off it only logged me as walking for 22 minutes. I don't like that when I tried to get tech support I either had to wait forever for calling or chat, or the other option was Twitter which I choose not to use. I guess I will have to turn the stupid elliptical on.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Raymond Carbonneau Robles,Functional,"Nice app in theory but has a lot of frustrating, unintuitive elements. I have to refresh the data often as it doesn't appear to pull from the wearable often enough. It tends to log my family members off, so I have to help them log on again. It also doesn't appear to speak directly to Google Fit, which is unsurprising how poor the ""integration"" is between Nest and Google Home.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Kimberly Hilliard,Functional,"It doesn't always give accurate data (ie. If you sit still, such as reading a book, it shows that you were asleep. Same way with the exercise data.

Marcia Grossman,Functional,"Very accurate step counter. Important for me. However, the Fitbit platform appears to be unstable. Often won't sync, and app needs to be reinstalled.

Greta Blake,Functional,"The new update is poor! I can't reorganize the sections based on the stats I follow most, having to scroll up and down is very annoying! There's no battery % anymore. Bring back these features, please! There is one improved thing, when you're searching for a workout you can sort by category, therefore making it easier to find what you're looking for. I still miss the fitbit coach that used to give ready follow on workouts without having to search and make your own plan.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Amateur Warden,Functional,"Yeah the new look sucks I liked it better before. I like the app functions, but the new update made everything look the same, all white and purple? Like, why?

mich ael,Functional,"The app works well, but there's a lot of features to be desired, that people are asking for, that are ignored.

And when I do try to edit, it sometimes gives me an error, or won't let me update. With a company like Fitbit, persistent bugs like this are unacceptible!",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hi, Tracy.

Kids Life,Functional,"The new app look is beautiful, but so many things have changed. I no longer know how to change the watch face on my kid's Ace 3, I can't see my child's steps or heart rate, and it doesn't have the best customisation. Things that used to be good are now either no longer there or not as good. Please fix these things and make it easier to use. It would make life much easier!

O'Shea Quigley,Functional,Fitbit is a good app for fitness tracking but lately after the recent update it has been having problems syncing. I thought it was a problem with my Fitbit versa three so I did a factory reset on it. The only way I managed to set it up was through Bluetooth and it took over 2 hours. I got it working and it has a better time syncing. (Edit) They fixed the problem so it is good,system requirement,4,,

Lost some customization and some areas like blood glucose no longer are on the dashboard. You have to open the area yo see your readings.

Baldero Mendoza,Functional,"I love this app! I use it all the time, constantly. It is crucial for tracking my afib - I can see the episodes, the duration, the intensity , daily, weekly, etc. I can track my exercise and so much more. It's just amazing! The only flaw, to me, is the sleep feature. I realize I have sleep apnea, but good grief! If it were up to Fitbit I'd be in bed 22 hrs a day. Luckily the sleep feature can largely be done manually, so that handles that issue. Also, I continually have issues with syncing.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Tammy Walston,Functional,"I use the app to track my activity -steps, stairs, etc and to track and work on improving my sleep. It's user-friendly and has functions I've not explored yet. Update 2023: The app has been updated, and the interface is completely different. I don't love it. It went from easy to see my info with a quick scroll to having to scroll up and down trying to find what I'm looking for plus a lot of taps. I may get used to it, but I don't like it. Thus, the downgraded rating.",New feature,4,,
Antonio Balboa,Functional,"It's a mostly fantastic app. I love the new interface, but I had only been using the previous interface for a couple months. I love the tracking of just about everything and how it shows you your trends. My primary gripe is that runs on treadmills show very limited data. No splits for my treadmill runs is a bit annoying. I hope they can address this soon. The other two pretty popular health tracking apps both give lots of detail in treadmill runs.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Noelle Campagna,Functional,"Not loving parts of the new update - the large amounts of white space and the same colored icons make it hard to easily find what I'm looking for. The heart rate zone colors have also been heavily muted, making it harder to see at a glance where my heart rate was during my workouts. Besides that, the app is super helpful and easy to use. I do like the progress bars and percentages that came with new updates, as well as the more refined coaching tab",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Meredith Razen,Functional,"Pretty user friendly - I particularly find the food tracking section to be far better than any others I have tried, however, I wish that I could input the actual time that I ate something, rather than having to use one of the predetermined categories, and I really wish that it showed the carbohydrate count for each item entered, as it does for calories, rather than just the total carbs at the top... They're assuming I can handle that math, but sometimes I can't... Lol!",New feature,4,,
Robert eddleman,Functional,"Great app. I have a Versa 3. GPS function could be more apparent. Haven't located it yet. I love the sleep tracker feature.

Apryl Dunlap,Functional,"I love Fitbit, I've owned many. They just keep getting better. I would love to see a place to keep body measurements, a daily Journaling option, and a place to log daily meds and supplements as those are things I monitor already and I have to use separate apps to do it. They are all part of my health journey and to have it all in one place would be amazing.",New feature,4,,
Nicole Pastore,Functional,"I really like this app. I think it has a great database of foods. I like that I can create a custom food for recipes that I make.

I've rebooted my phone without any resolution. Very disappointed in this glitch.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
GoBird Dawg,Functional,"Overall, it's quite good. Shortcomings are the heart rate monitor accuracy (often reads high to very high during exercise) and calories burned I believe is too high as well. I also don't like to be pushed towards premium subscription. I already bought the device, I shouldn't be badgered for a monthly service I don't feel I need.

Stephen Maus,Functional,"Overall it's a solid app, but I do not like the aesthetic of this latest update. It is just...bland.

wes bell,Functional,The latest changes to the app address mixed. While the sync with the mobile seems more stable...a removal of battery level from the app is a step in the wrong direction.

Betty Adams,Functional,"The Charge 4 has been a great tracker for me. Steps, sleep, goals, and vitals are basically what I have used it for. There was a period when I was not able to wear it, and when I came back, it seemed like some options had been moved over to the premium subscription. That was disappointing.

Beth Williams,Functional,"Overall, it's pretty good! I'm suscribed to the paid version, and there's definitely a lot of great features, like workouts, tracking capabilities, recipes, and more. A few things I'd love to see: For the recipes, offer a downloadable or at least typed out version instead of only a video. The ""Frequent"" and ""Recent"" lists for food tracking need improvement.

Lisa Fronczek,Functional,"This app is relatively easy to use. Nice dashboard view for the days.

C. L. R.,Functional,"I've used Fitbits for years-3 different ones! I like them, but they have occasional hiccups with tracking here and there. Usually they come up with an update and it helps. But, I do wish they would make the food tracking easier! So frustrating to not be to select to put foods alphabetically on the app or delete foods you don't eat anymore. Scrolling down to find a food is time consuming. Even on the site it isn't easy to delete things- only if they're custom- where you add them yourself.",New feature,4,,
Lydia Glider-Shelley,Functional,"I'm pretty happy with the device. However, could you PLEASE program it so that the voice prompt lets us know if/when the GPS is lost, so we can stop and reconnect, for a more accurate representation of our routes? Also, having the pulse oximetry measured at night is good, but it would be wonderful to see a graph detailing ups and downs in our O2 and what time the lows occur. I'd also like my fitbit to vibrate or make a sound to wake me up if my pulse ox falls too low. (Below 90)",New feature,4,,
Nancy Cochran,Functional,"There are several features that I use daily and like quite well. It's easy to record meals, particularly if you use the ""frequent"" or ""recent"" tab.

Jim â€œYogiâ€,Functional,"I think it's strange. It does do the job, but it is not intuitive. It also seems to emphasize Napping - down-time. Huh? Tell me the step count! It's also very slow, but never tell you that. Example: you click on a task, and it just freezes. No feedback (like a progress bar) that it's still alive doing anything.

Beverly Lewis,Functional,"Generally speaking, it does keep track of steps, heart rate, distance, and sleep. However to get other information, one has to subscribe to Premium for 9.99 per month.

Jessie Herr,Functional,"One thing that I'd really like to see, is a revamp on the food logging, such as being able to manually save favorite foods for easier tracking- instead of trying to scroll through lists looking for it or typing/searching for it.

Takes a good 20 mins in morning for sleep data to push up to the app. Sometimes I still have to directly open the app on the watch to for the phone app to sync. For two Google products, should be better.",system requirement,4,,
Cindy Guevara,Functional,"I am addicted to my Fitbit and the app. It's had issues over the years but when it works it's completely indispensable! I love all the data it provides and the help with the extras like timers, linking to Alexa, and all my other apps. Seriously, I love it. I wish the brand of devices was just a bit more durable, but overall I love the app and the devices. I've owned lots of models and loved them as they came out.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,

Dian Sesma,Functional,"I have a fitbit charge 5. The app is pretty general and easy to use. I'm disappointed in the clock face options. They aren't very creative or colorful. Would be nice to be able to create my own. Another part of the app that needs improvement is the food logging. You can't delete items that are no longer needed, and it keeps multiples of the same food items on the logger list. Which makes it a waste of space and time looking for a particular item. Same title items should become 1.",New feature,4,,
Cara Carlson,Functional,"I have been using this app and Fitbit devices since 2015, and I agree that they are very user-friendly. However, these are the things I have noticed could improve this app: The menstrual tracking needs to be more customizable and allow you to input your own symptoms. Meditations need to be able to be manually entered, the mediations available in the app are short, and there aren't very many. Also, watches need to stop counting steps while in a biking workout. It's double counting activity.",New feature,4,,
Dan Traina,Functional,"After having some issues with instabilities within the app I reinstalled. This fixed the instability issues, I should have thought of this myself. App looks good and I look forward to exploring it more. Is there a good, quick way to stop tracking steps while I use my riding lawnmower. I would really rather not trick it with starting a false activity and then deleting it. This is a very real issue with fitness trackers. Simply a pause step counting option would be great. Thanks",New feature,4,"Hi, Dan. We're sorry to hear this, but thanks for your feedback.

mizCD 1,Functional,"I've had the Inspire 2 for about 8 months now. I've enjoyed using this app for the step counter, sleep tracker, and food tracker. I'm not sure how accurate the pedometer is, but the fact that I can set a reminder to move helps me out significantly at work all day. In addition, I find sometimes when you scan the barcoodes for food items the codes don't always correspond to the correct food, or if companies have updated the calorie count, the fitbit database doesn't have the updated count.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Antau L'Jn,Functional,"I was gifted an Inspire 3 watch (I had sworn never to do Fitbit again because syncing was a horrible nightmare). Inspire 3 always syncs, which is a huge improvement over the original Inspire and app. You set alarms from the watch. I wish they still let you do it from the app. You can tell the watch you're starting certain exercises (you set the list from the app on the phone).",New feature,4,,
Charlotte Wright,Functional,"I have used Fitbit for years and mostly it is great. I will maintain my 4 stars rating, however, because the tracking water feature does not record accurately or sometimes not at all. If this aggravation is fixed, I would cheerfully give Fitbit 5 stars. It does a good job of helping me stay on track with exercise, proper diet and a generally healthy lifestyle. I also like the additional features, such as meditation, sleep guides, and exercise videos.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"The app itself is fine. The dashboard is lightly customizable and you can turn various functions on and off. I use a fitbit for step tracking and that's about it, really, so the app and hardware do what I need it to do. However, some more customization options in the dashboard and a more stable syncing process would be nice. Additionally, not a huge fan of having to turn my location on to get a sync on my fitbit 2. That seems like a bit of a stretch to me. In any case, the app works fine for what I need it for. Those who need something hardcore may be disappointed though.",system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,I really enjoy this. Lots of features on the app. I've put off getting a Fitbit for a while. The Ionic is fantastic and the battery life is great. As for the app. It's a little ridiculous that you have to use software on a desktop to download songs onto the watch. I have a chromebook which makes this next to impossible. Incorporating a way to move song files via the bluetooth connection and the phone app would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Fitbit,New feature,4,,
Nicole Zimmers,Functional,"The past few weeks the app is very sporadic with syncing. And over the past three days, I can't get it to sync at all.

The syncing issues seems to have been resolved and everything is working well",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Brianna Erickson,Functional,"It's a pretty good app but one improvement would be w/some of the premium features. Specifically, the work out videos section. There is no way to search for specific workouts or types. The only options are little filters at the top that have limited choices. It would be nice to be able to search for specific instructors, types (mobility, core, legs, etc.), length, etc. Having this in the favorites area would be great as well.

It wasn't updating or syncing with my phone. Out of the box phone notifications didn't seem to be on by default. I figured as soon as I connected my phone I'd be able to see my text, emails, calendar, etc. But, it wasn't, I had to dig into the menus and enable notifications. I also think it's strange that the app store access is in a menu.",system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Update after several improvements to the app: it syncs faster and takes less steps to initiate. Since I only use it for Alarms, Sleep and Steps, I can't comment on other features. Messages no longer sync to my Fitbit, but I'm not sure it is the fault of the app or the device.

A Google user,Functional,"I've had 2 Fitbits, the original basic model and now an Alta HR. I switched up because arthritis in my hands made it very hard to squeeze the band closed on the first one. While I like them both, I find the HR more persnickety about syncing with devices. I never know from one day to the next if it will sync easily or will I have to restart the device, sometimes more than once, before it will sync. This has not improved with the new app version, by the way.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Dennis Heinle,Functional,"This app has been pretty solid for me after switching to a Pixel 6/Fitbit Sense. The sleep, water and exercise tracking are great. However, the food tracking is terrible. The database is bloated with a bunch of duplicate or out-of-date information, you have to add things one-at-a-time, the search is bad and rarely finds anything even in the ballpark of what I look for and you can't create recipes in app and if you use the web site to track anything, it'll often break the sync for that thing.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Jalisa Johnson,Functional,"Overall, a pretty good app to be paired with my device. Other than the bugs I experience here and there, I don't have any serious complaints. But I do have a suggestion. I experience periods, and i use the tracker, but i wish there was an option to exclude certain cycles that are out of the ordinary from my data so that I can get a better reading of my average cycles. It would make everything so much easier to read.",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Very nice UI. Does not always cooperate, especially with more tasking things using your device's GPS to track distance on a non-gps watch. Also has a poor settings / error message response system. Those complaints aside, it is pretty stable, and has many excellent features: from goal setting, to exercise and sleep tracking, to food and water intake logs, and more.",system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Generally, it's a great app. There are a few things that I wish were changed. I wish you could see heart rate zones while exercising and I wish you could fix the distance as it does not track accurately most of the time while exercising on machines. 6 miles on the flexstride equals 1.3 miles on my Fitbit. I also wish you could set up food combinations so you don't have to find all the ingredients every time you have that meal.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,Overall I really love this app and my charge 3 Fitbit. It is great at auto tracking workouts that involve running or walking. It accurately tracks the distance and heart rate during both of those exercises. The one feature I really wish it had was the ability to track cycling workouts. You can put them in retrospectively but it won't track heart rate during your workout (which is pretty important to me).,New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"I actually love my Fitbit, but the newest update on May 10th has messed with my stats.  The watch is collecting the data correctly, and the app agrees with the watch, except the app is not telling me all of the exercises, under the exercise option.  I generally do two workouts a day, and it is only crediting one.  Now not really a big deal, since it is there in steps, and time, but I use that section to help me identify how hard I am working out.  Ideas?",system requirement,4,,
Selahndra Mathew,Functional,Overall good. It's hard to find where to change things if it's not setup how you want. Trouble shooting issues isn't too hard though. The lamest part is when I updated to version 32.72.1.23. It tells me EVERY TIME I open the app to set up phone notifications: I DON'T WANT TO because I HATE notifications. I tried to trick it by turning them on and then turning them off but that didn't work. Make it stop!!!!!,Security Requirements,4,,

Overall this is a great app, what keeps me from giving it five stars is the fact that it has a bug that has not been fixed.

Gregg Arpin,Functional,"Decent app. Tracks steps, workouts, runs and even meals. Keeps historical records of everything so you can monitor progress. My only complaint is that you can't combine foods into meals.

Instead of manually adding each individual component, I can just click the 'Custom Meal' I've already saved. Hate to compare, but My Fitness Pal does this best.

Jaclyn Jensen,Functional,"I am a long time user of fitbit watches. In general the app has been fine and the upgrades tend to be good, but I think what is missing from the calorie tracking is a way to quickly input BOTH calories and macronutrients.

Abigail Neal,Functional,"It's absolutely amazing. I love this Fitbit. What I enjoy most about my Fitbit is how it keeps me on track to keep moving. Also, the features are easy to use and who doesn't appreciate the click on the wrist. Conveniently, the best experiences and the most important documents of your daily tasks are right on your wrist. I love it!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Susan Neff,Functional,It's structured differently than it was before. This is not bad just takes a bit longer for me to enter numbers. Actually the emotional part is stressed more and mind/body are easier to understand.,system requirement,5,,
Archer Vixen,Functional,It's a great app! I love the tracking abilities and reminders to move. Would love if the Fitbit read blood glucose and did LLLT Low level light therapy. Perhaps reminders to drink water but I have another app for that. Love it!,New feature,5,,
Tristina Huff,Functional,"I loved using this app but unfortunately it is no longer syncing my Inspire 2 and I can't update what I need for my watch. It's very frustrating. I would totally rate a 5 if it would start working g properly again. UPDATE: Haven't had any problems since my last review, and it works great.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Maciej Solecki,Functional,"New UI looks much more modern, I have just noticed that selectors on clickable elements have very small contrast to background so it looks like they weren't there (it's hard to notice which element was clicked).

Erica Berglund,Functional,"Edit: Amazingly, it seems to be fixed now! So that's cool. Thanks for the tip!! Original review: Good. ""Recent"" foods are a bit of a joke though.

Amelia Martin,Functional,The user experience greatly depends on what device you have. The app has a lot more features with my Sense than it did with my Inspire HR. One thing that I have had a problem consistently is having my weight recorded when I step on my Aria Air. I have to force a stop in the app settings and then open up the app for it to record my weight and it doesn't even record my BMI. I also wish you could record your blood pressure in app like you can record you blood glucose.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

M Welch,Functional,"UPDATE!! Changing 1 star back to 5 star. I've used a fitbit ZIP since it's founding. Through the years updates to apps would make it NOT sync easily to the phone. Customer service never helped citing age of my fitbit or model of my phone. It was so frustrating saying ""click to update software"" and it would not update or connect. I wrote customer service but again got no where. Battery died again but this time it's WORKING and SYNCING! THANK YOU FOR FINALLY MAKING IT WORK AGAIN!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Anne Middleton,Functional,I really don't like this new version. The older one was brilliant more colourful and much easier to use. Please bring back the original version.

Tom Bryant,Functional,"Update - updating again as of 18 Sept 23. Catching up on all missed entries back to 21 August... for me Fitbit (app) has been syncing with the Onetouch glucose app bringing over the readings into Fitbit - I really like it as it's very helpful in comparing glucose readings with the foods I'm consuming.

ChristiAnne Smith,Functional,"Since the redesign, the tracker feature for runs & walks with a map is no longer available - which was its best feature. Also, fatburn, cadio, & peak have been replaced by light, moderate, vigorous, & peak, and only tells you after the fact so exercise intensity can not be altered or seen in real time. Very dissatisfied with the new look, which is far less detailed. The old Fitbit app was perfect. Now it's just a glorified stepcounter.",system requirement,5,,
Stephanie Belcher,Functional,"I didn't like the update and posted that. It was slow. A developer responded letting me know the fix (stop app, log out, restart, login).

jimtomatola,Functional,"Much improved connectivity. Almost constant updates from the Charge 2 I have connected to it. If I were to make changes I would put the "" Choose your favorite 4 measurements to track "" setup screen first in line instead of last behind sleep, exercise, etc",New feature,5,,
Roy W.,Functional,"Works well with the Fitbit. My wife and I have used it for years now. Version releases come out every so often with occasional new features. It's a little pricy at the pro rate. We're retired, fixed income, so it'd be nice to have an AARP rate for us old folks. That said, we can give a 5 star rating. It's helping us live healthier. Cheers",New feature,5,,
Stephen Grantham,Functional,"Once set up and paired it's great. Charge your Fitbit then take your time setting up account & password. Ensure Bluetooth enabled. It's great, sort of gives new meaning to casual exercise. App works ok, nice fresh look and feel. No problems once paired. Just follow instructions carefully. Google run this now, latest version does not put percentage number against battery which is a shame.",system requirement,5,,
Joe Gibson,Functional,"The most recent update has great quality of life improvements. While it may look like just a reskin of the old app, it does provide a bit better navigation. But where it really shines is reliability of the data synced between the Pixel Watch and the app. Before the update it could be incredibly inaccurate. I could go up and down dozens of stairs, while the app would say I'd done 0, my watch would say I'd done all my hourly steps, while the app would randomly delete some hours. All fixed now!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Samantha Dunn,Functional,"Since the update, this app is confusing and DULL DULL DULL! No colours, bland and difficult to navigate to find my data. Also the woke language... gone is fat burning, in comes moderate... I am more inspired to work harder if I see fat burning! Agree with other reviews, am seeking out alternative competitors for new watch. I just hope the App designer for Fitbit doesn't follow over to the same competitor ... Very disappointed Fitbit.. you could have done better",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
James Keen,Functional,"I for one really like and appreciate the new layout. It works very well for me. Everything is easy to find and the main information I need is now front and centre. The colours are more consistent and less busy. My only complaint is that it's not everywhere. For instance when you go into the weight section, that's still in the old style. But I'm sure that will come. Nice work Google/fitbit.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Mrs CiCi LOVE,Functional,"EXCELENTE DEVICE. Appreciate all the wellness extras via the app, however the latest update now limits what you are able to view in your activity history.

Jeff Cabay,Functional,"I absolutely love my Versa 4. My biggest success was losing over 50 lbs in a 9-month period. The food app was the key! If you stay in your budget, you will lose weight. I was unknowingly consuming 3500/4000 calories/day. You will not lose weight eating that much unless you burn 4000 to 4500 calories/day. The app helped me figure all of this out. I would love to see in future updates a way to switch from steps to punches. I do lots of boxing. ðŸ¥ŠðŸ’¥ Also, update to Health Connect more often! ðŸ˜‰",New feature,5,,

Bradley Donnelly,Functional,"Honestly it's a great idea, but it really feels as if the priority of this app is about profiting off of people that are struggling rather than helping people. Don't get me wrong some of the features are good. Like some first aid. Its quite expensive and some of the features that I think should be free are only for people that pay.

Wendy S (RattlesnakeHaven),Functional,"I don't find it helpful. It stores everything you type, with no option that I can find to delete the files other than to go into each entry and delete the text. If you take the quizzes, it saves the results and displays them, apparently permanently. I couldn't find any way to delete the results. Phones don't have unlimited storage capacity and it wouldn't take long for this app to become huge. The breathing exercises are pretty random. Might have a placebo effect on particularly suggestible folks. There's a mood tracking thing, but I honestly can't comprehend being so self-absorbed that I consider my moods to be historic events worth making a permanent record of. Maybe that's why the app doesn't seem useful to me. The journal prompts are also all about moods and feelings, so not useful if you're not super self-absorbed. If you need to be reminded to brush your teeth and do the laundry, or if you're really self-absorbed and want to immortalize your every mood, and be able to review it on your phone all the time, go for it.

I don't use Alert notifications for most apps since it's very distracting, but I *do* want an unobtrusive visual reminder to look at the Finch app - hence setting notifications to Silent. Setting notifications to Silent doesn't actually work for this app, though. You can set a notification to Silent, but the next time that event occurs a new notification with the same name gets created. This ""new"" notification type defaults to the Alert type notification.

Kawaii Toast,Functional,"I adore this app, it's been very helpful for me, especially with the recent update where you can have repeating goals. That said, when I am setting reminders for particular times, the time always sets to remind me at AM. If I set a reminder for 12 or 2 PM, it'll automatically set to remind me at 12 or 2 AM instead. This is very frustrating, to say the least.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Dbomb,Functional,"Wasn't useful enough for me to keep. I liked that it was a cute way reminiscent of tamagochi to put on my phone. I also liked that it suggested a lot of different goals. The user interface wasn't great for me, and there were tons of grammatical errors in the text. One example: when asked to do a morning reflection on why my morning is happy, it said it in the past tense, which was a weird usage given the morning is starting?? It was nice free, but I am just glad I didn't pay for it.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Sarah Liepins,Functional,"Generally fairly good for keeping track of goals, but does have a few issues. The reflections system has trouble recognizing tone, so I always have to go back and fix it.

Parnita Harsh,Functional,"Really nice idea and would recommend people to try however there are two big issues in my opinion so far: - Dark mode - The goals you set everyday are not entirely curated. You can get repeats the same day, and that same set of goals to choose from can be the same as the next day. They're not really synergistic with each other and feel limited. I'm assuming better goals is locked behind a paywall in addition.

A S,Functional,"Great concept, but the app has some major downsides. For example, soundscapes do not work as supposed to, every time I try to use soundscapes for sleep, they just stop playing in a few minutes time, despite me choosing 8hrs. Also, breathing excercises really need sound prompts, because when one is trying to fall asleep or calm down, it is common to close one's eyes and not look at the screen.

Mincraft. Mistries,Functional,"I hate writing reviews, but I love this app. I actually have an incentive to get my goals done to decorate my bird/house. My only complaint is that I can't choose the time that my goals reset to my knowledge. They all reset at 12, which may seem really late to others, but I'm a bit of a night owl (pun not intended) and stay up past 12, and would like to have the ability to choose when my goals reset, if there is a way and I'm just stupid please let me know, otherwise this is an amazing app :))",New feature,4,,
Jade Dennison,Functional,This app is absolutely lovely and helps me so much to practice self care and keep track of my goals. I am happily subscribed to the premium paid service as well.

Mike Tang,Functional,"Overall, this app is awesome - so helpful for building positive, self-care habits. BUT if you're actually struggling with anxiety, depression, etc. go into this ready for the horrible UX. The experience trying to navigate the app (especially adding friends or managing payments) is nauseating how horrible it is.

Really good concept, incredibly helpful, really bad ux.",system requirement,4,,
Amara,Functional,"I love this app and I've been using it for a while, but one of my tags for a person keeps saying it's an object, and will switch itself back to object after I change it. This tag is connected to that person in tree town, so when i click on their bird, it brings up the tag screen, saying no reflections or anything even thought there should be info. It won't let me interact with them, and it brings up the wrong screen. It also won't let me download a save file, so I can't think how I can fix it.",system requirement,4,,
Abbie King,Functional,"Overall I think it is a great app and very wall amde. However the plus version is very expensive and I I can't afford it yet the adds for it get slightly anoying.

Gracen Buchanan,Functional,"I absolutely loved this app! However, the price and one functionality brought it down for me. I really really enjoyed watching my birb grow up but once it's fully grown nothing happens anymore. I think it would be cool if my birb ""left the nest"" so to speak.

Christopher Burke,Functional,"I really like the idea of the app. It is thoughtful, interesting and can get you thinking. Great to go through with someone else. The pay wall is a bit much for me. While yearly rates are offered they are still too much and sometimes you get a goal to do like a 5 minute breathing exercise but it only let's you do the exercise for 1 or 3 minutes. The 5 minute option is locked unless you pay. I just do the exercise with another app and come back to make it completed. Still good, overall.",New feature,4,,
Meli M,Functional,"Cute theme and reminders, plenty to do without paying so it's not just a money grab. Lost a star because it doesn't automatically back up its data at all. You have to manually do it, so if you forget or don't do it often enough, you lose progress. Lost a fair bit because the app started crashing on open, and no fix worked until uninstalling to reinstall it. Given the purpose of the app, it's dependent on motivation that might not be there, and is incredibly demotivating to lose progress.",system requirement,4,,

I do also like the inclusion of when your waking hours are, since I'm very much a night owl so I'm not up in the morning.

Bridget Van't Hof,Functional,I absolutely love this app it has helped not just my mental health but remembering to do things and actually getting them done! There are a few things that could be improved but that is with any app really. One thing I am having issues with is time zones.

Ta Ge,Functional,"Decent app. Got bored with it shy of two months, which may have been the first update I had. Prior to that, there was more you could do without premium. Like that it has ability for frequent check in. Most apps give you the option to do it once. Moods change throughout the day and could be because of an experience. Finch gives you the ability to write that down in the moment's reflection. It has glitches in typing. If you forget to check in, you can't complete goals until after.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Hi!

Also love getting to dress up my finch and learning about her adventures. Couple of small things I would like to suggest. First, it would be cool if you could make custom sound mixes to listen to, even if it was just a plus feature. Second, I really wish there was a way to pull up a list of all of your set goals, and more easily manage them. Overall, strongly recommend.",New feature,4,,
Kayla Diaz,Functional,"This is such a great app and helps me get into a habit of journaling from time to time. A good idea would probably to add little mini games to relieve stress and have fun especially in a space that gives you anxiety. One thing I have to admit is that the soundscapes... Are kinda scary. Soft rain sounds way too hard to be considered soft. The animal sounds sort of sound weird, but it's really just my opinion. I tend to skip those.

C W,Functional,Finch is really engaging and easy to use. There is not a lot to do in the app which is perfect for me since I tend to get burned out by apps like this easily with more options.

Cadence H,Functional,"Overall great app! Everything functions well and it's easy. However, I think the devs should add a way to make reoccurring goals. Ex: every sunday you need to study, so you make your goal ""study"" and set it to pop up every Sunday for how ever long. I also think they should have extra things in the app like a grocery list, or a list of long term goals. Ex: you really want a computer, tablet, and switch so they're all in your list.

When you do custom answers with your Finch, their discoveries do not get added to their profile, which is extremely frustrating.

Jimmothy Boyles,Functional,"Very soothing app for me at least. Having this little bird remind me to do stuff has actually helped me somewhat put my life together. My suggestion to the developers would be to add more options to the breathing exercises in the app that are not behind a paywall, because the default breathing exercise may not work for everyone, even though it did work for me. I think it's only fair to give people the choice of what breathing exercises to do without having to pay.

Jack,Functional,"Been using 3 months now and just finished the free trial of Plus. The free app is great for motivation and reflection. It caters to people who are depressed, anxious, or have executive dysfunction. I have the latter but mainly use it to start and end my day positively. It's bad for productivity tracking because it has distracting little rewards for tasks like breathing and writing. Plus isn't worth it currently, and the whole app needs better QoL/interface. I'll consider paying if it improves.",system requirement,4,,

Sharon Standridge,Functional,"The free version is helpful. Being able to group with friends through the app and send encouragement is nice. The pet really does develop with your choices in their journey, and the art is cute. My ADLs are easier to do, and I've learned new grounding techniques. You have full access to the SOS action list, and there's no ads. The only complaint is that the relationship with my finch deteriorates if I miss a few days.

Eudaemonic Misfit (Nico),Functional,I absolutely love this app! All the features are wonderful! Thr onoy thing I would change would be the format of when you edit goals. I noticed that when you try to delete some goals and press the okay button. It doesnt actually get rid of those deleted goals after you log out and log back in. It doesnt save the changes. Thats really about it that I have seen that I keep getting irritated by but thats really it,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Serenity Tomala,Functional,"Has done a lot over the last couple of months to help my mindset, and get me through some of the harder days. The goals and the check ins help concentrate on what's really going on and find a positive moments when feels like everything is awful. However, I only gave it 4 stars because once your bird gets to adulthood, it gets very hard to unlock things and starts to feel a bit repetitive. It makes it easy to forget to do things, and makes goals feel less impactful. I'll continue to use, but less",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Hazel Foreman,Functional,"I absolutely love this app, it works really well for developing healthy behaviors and building habits of all kinds. The finch is adorable. I just wish there were more/better clothing options for the finch. I think my favorite part is dressing them up with me but many of the clothes are kind of unappealing visually. There are lots of fancy looking options, but I would like more casual options that aren't just plain text on a tshirt, for example.",New feature,4,,
Emily Johnson,Functional,So far the app has been great. I had the week trial then payed for the year! It has been a really nice brief way to check on periodically throughout the day. The only problem I have is that the cute little finch accessories are still pricy even after paying. I was hoping that some items would be free or vastly reduced. I have only been able to afford one item for Sven(my finch) after a week of checking in and what not.,system requirement,4,Agree on the suggestions - we'll re-evaluate the pricing and the game balance as we go!

ASHR,Functional,"Love this app, it feels incredibly helpful and rewarding even if you're just using the free version. But I have noticed that whenever I add a goal to a focus that is then scheduled for a specific date, that goal doesn't show up on my goal list for that day and goes completely unnoticed and unmentioned unless I check back on the actual focus page. This bug is frustrating and makes the app unhelpful for one-time goals",system requirement,4,Hi! So sorry about this! Please reach out to us at support@befinch.com so we can chat more about this!

Sarah A,Functional,"I enjoy all the opportunities to journal and I am motivated by the cute little finch. I like that it has light excercises and breathing tools. A cute feature is being able to dress up the finch. So, normally I like sound mixes to meditate to or otherwise relax but I think that maybe half of them are rather creepy. The owls and wolves....um, no. I think that they have a good platform but the sounds need tweaking. Less grainy sounding and more soothing sounds needed. Otherwise a great app!",FunctionalCapabilities,4,Hi! So glad to hear you love Finch! Thank you so much for taking the time to review.

N J,Functional,seems like it will be beneficial. biggest issue i have is that i need content to be offline as I'm frequently out of service range. i understand it would be unfeasible to install all featured content onto people's phones. but maybe offer the ability to locally save favorite exercises so that they're still available even when offline. it would be really appreciated to be able to stop and do a quick stretch or soundscape when i needed to regardless of my connectivity.,New feature,4,,
Lea Arroyo,Functional,"It's a pretty good app. I don't like how so many things are locked behind a paywall, though. This app helps me set goals for the day and suggests things to do such as spending time with family or taking time for myself. It has breathing exercises (though many you have to pay for) and quizzes relating to mental health. One suggestion is that I wish it had a to-do list feature, which would have you make a to-do list and remind you of your things to do.

Cat Rice,Functional,"This app is great for self care and those of us motivated by caring for a cure bird, but the notifications are awful. It just makes up new notifications pretty much any time the bird wants to say something, so even if you have everything but one or two notifications turned on it will randomly notify you for no real reason unless all your notifications are turned off. Also, it adds so many different kinds of notifications in the app settings that it's hard to find what you might want on at all.",system requirement,4,Hi! Thanks for reviewing! Glad you like Finch so far! We have 4 notification options! The first two are for good morning or good night notifs! The third is to send insights on your journey so far to the mailbox within the app! And the last one is the one that sends encouraging messages from your birb throughout the day! I hope this helps! - BriðŸ,
J H,Functional,I really like this app and it's gotten even better since I started using it. The newest added feature that condenses time assigned tasks was a great thing for someone like me that can have 100 goals in any given day. One thing I wish they would add as an option is to choose if we want the progress reports throughout the week or if we want them combined and only delivered once or twice a week. I would love being able to have the option for one or two reports with all the info.,New feature,4,,
Kiana Komatsu,Functional,"App is helpful for giving the little push need and accpuntability without nagging you. There are somthings I think changing that would be good. The subscription section through the app is not interactable, I would like to know if there are more $ plans avalible through the app and when my next payment is needed. The play store allows it a bit, but even on the website how much we pay is not clear enough. The text size when editing ""reflections"" is a bit small and hard to interact with as well.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
R. S.,Functional,"Finch has been an incredible tool. The lack of shame or punishment over missed tasks is really key, but there's also nice arrangement of prompts and exercises with customizable goals. The task timer is one of my favorite tools, especially with the journal option to reflect if you're stuck on that task. I do think more customizable prompts would be nice, and maybe more guidance/encouragement for executive function? Dye purchases also can't be made at Da Finci's since the update. :(",New feature,4,,
Mossy,Functional,"Overall I've been using this for three weeks now, I got a real kick out of the first few weeks. Genuinely some very helpful ideas on here- breathing exercises, good incentive to complete goals without feeling overbearing, and a good atmosphere.

Sunny Neon Raye,Functional,"the activities are helpful for mindfulness, without being too distracting or demanding. you aren't pestered or penalized for missing a check in. you can even add people to your ""neighborhood"" without them adding the app, and Finch will give suggestions to reach out to those freinds. great for anxiety and adhd. the logic of how the app parses out your reflections is pretty solid; it's impressive!

Liliana Saeteurn,Functional,"This app is good but most of the features cost a subscription which as a high school student causes me more stress. Two thing that I don't personally like is the fact that there is only one exercise for day and another for night. the other thing that I don't like is that it involves a lot of typing and in your journal the ai says what mood it gives off or something, basically I'd like it for the user to edit what it meant for the user.

Kitty Rosalina,Functional,"I really love this app. It has made such a big difference in my life. I wish there was more personalization options with everything. The biggest thing I want is the ability to add our own permanent reflections, first aid, everything. There are a lot of options but everyone is different and I don't want to add things as goals when it's a writing prompt I want to do every now and then as a reflection. A special goal that you can repeat for things you need to do mutiple times a day.",New feature,4,,
Elizabeth Freeze,Functional,I'm really enjoying this app. The motivational quotes each day seem to be just what I need to hear. I love that there's a first aid kit for if you're in a mental emergency. The breathing exercises are great. I wish there was a way to earn more of the rainbow stones since all the clothes and such are so expensive. Also the tree friend feature would be nice if you had a better way to search for friends. Also when someone randomly visits I wish there was a prompt to friend them. Overall fun app!,New feature,4,,
Doctor Good WhOmens Leech,Functional,"It is great so far from what I have tried, but on a LG Stylo 6, it lags a great bit.

Helps with sleep, you can write about your day, and set goals, and take a bunch of diff test that vary from ptsd, anxiety, depression and more.

Collyn Curry,Functional,"Overall I love this app! I have the paid subscription and it's definitely worth it for the extra features. However, I find it really frustrating that the amount of gems you get varies so much between exercises, activities, from your Finch at the end of their trip, and even in your daily reward box.

David Sissac,Functional,"This app helps me a lot in an interactive way. I've been doing fine with a calendar and to do list but Finch helps to make it more intimate of an experience to practice self care. I really do like this app and hope in the future there will be more functions (more bird colors, more ways to interact with friends, and more unique interactions between you and your bird friend). Keep going you're doing great creators!",New feature,5,,
Zaiden Palfreyman,Functional,"The only self care app I've actually stuck with. Premium is 100% worth it, but I do feel some things shouldn't be premium locked. Like adding icons to new tasks. It gets confusing when all my personal made tasks have nonsense random emojis to represent them. And I wish there was a log of previous days you could view/edit. Some days I'm too busy to input things on my phone, but had done all my tasks, and I can't go back and fix that :(",system requirement,5,,
Chloe,Functional,I've had an absolutely wonderful experience with this app and have nothing bad so say in the slightest. The team who made it is obviously full of amazing and caring people because it is one of the best apps I have come across. They take feedback so well and even offer an option for those who can't afford a subscription to still be able to access paywall blocked content.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Pink Panther,Functional,"Possibly the greatest app I have ever had. I always struggled to get things done in the past, but now I feel so organized and productive thanks to a digital bird I'm raising. Seriously though. If you wanna do stuff but just struggle to do it, get this app! On top of helping with productivity, it has free stretching exercises, anxiety relief, relaxing soundscapes, goal setting, and of course a customizable birb. I would give six stars if I could!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Katriana Call,Functional,"I love this app, it's actually helped me stay motivated to be productive and avoid laying in bed all day. Although, I wish there was a way to edit the goals in the day. For example, twice now I've accidentally skipped the wrong goal and had no way to undo it that was clearly shown. Would also be cool to have different animal options for our Finch.",New feature,5,,
Stine W,Functional,"It's very cute. I think the gamification of self care is cute and enjoyable. I think it might be a useful boost if you need more motivation to do your self care. Otherwise it's possibly a little too much screen time but at least it's positive rather than scrolling. The first aid tab is a great idea. I'm confused about the adventure setting and don't really know what it is. Overall, I think the journals should be exportable as a diary in txt format.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Rebecca Gilbertson,Functional,"Such a cute app and kind of addicting to advance my birb along as well as completing my own tasks and goals. Setting longer term goals, takes a few more steps to do and if you forget to have a goal rollover, you'll lose it entirely. I think with the pro/upgraded account, you can see past day history but not in the free account. So far the fact that I'm still using it and on day 5, is impressive to me. With ADHD it's not always easy to maintain my attention to apps and to keep coming back again!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Alhana McNutt,Functional,"This app helps me with externalising motivation to take care of myself by taking care of a bird. I love the first aid section, which helps with anxiety and depression symptoms. I use the breathing exercises and the soundscapes most often. Although all of the important stuff is free, I paid for a yearly subscription. Sadly, the subscription did not transfer to my new phone! I don't know what to do to fix that",system requirement,5,,
Edessa Stockard (edessa22),Functional,"Love the app it's super fun and really helpful. I use it as a mental health tracker as well as a to do list. it helps me get things done because it's giving me something else to take care of. I feel more motivated to do things in order to help my Finch grow. It's an adorable app too. Daily affirmations, check lists, progress reports, and a pet who also has pets. I love buying my Finch outfits and having him travel the world. The highlight of each day is when he's back from an adventure! 100/10",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
T H,Functional,This app is great. It I had to choose between my therapy app and this one I'd choose to save this one. the app has the ability to lighten my mood and overall outlook on life overall. I think it's great at pulling the best things out of me as I interact with my birb and then reflecting those things back to me. so it's telling me thing I belive in bit have lost sight of. it's brilliant and I love it so much.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Christy Barrett,Functional,"Such a cute way to motivate me to do more self care things - taking better care of me takes better care of my pet! I love that I can reflect on our interactions and discoveries, and that there's even a rant zone. The quizzes are helpful and I love the affirmations every time I open the app. It's just been a great experience all around. I probably will get the upgrade later but even the free version is great",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Carl White,Functional,"I'm a little embarrassed than to be playing with this micropet, tomagatchi look-a-like. But, honestly, the task scheduling is more sophisticated than Google Tasks, and the playfulness of it reminds me to check it at all. For instance, there are many tasks that one needs to be on repeat, but it does no good to let pile up on your to do list if they don't get done each day. this app can do that.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Ashley Alberto,Functional,"Honestly, the first time I tried Finch, I did not get the hang of it because it felt like a lot to learn at once. However, after trying other habits and wellness apps, this one takes the cake! It's fun, cute, and actually encourages self care. I feel motivated to complete my daily tasks because of how game-like it is. I do wish Finch had a slower new users tour at the beginning. I feel like, because this app truly does have it all, it can be overwhelming as to where to start, but it's so good.",New feature,5,,
Daniele Notarnicola,Functional,"It sounds dramatic, but this app has legit helped me change my life. I was stuck in a really bad rut, and setting goals with this little bird has helped me reconnect with myself, feel more energized and motivated, and, long story short, helped me peel myself off the couch. I had coworkers and friends download it as well, and it has unanimously helped all of us in one way or another â",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Smol Bean,Functional,"You really don't know how much you need it until you have itm. Got it because it looked cute and I wanted to use it to keep on track for doing homework every day, not expecting to use the self care parts. But now whenever things get rough I can do the breathing exercises, have fun doing the adventures with my finch, and it helps me make the most of trials. And as for the productivity uses, it's better than I imagined! It really keeps me motivated to do it and rewards me when I'm done!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Sia S,Functional,"I would just like to say, I love this app! It helped me stay on goal and getting supportive messages throughout the day is so lovely! I did sign up for premium and am also a guardian as well. Mental and emotional health is so important to me and finally, I'm glad to have an app that supports this so well! Good job to the developers! Edit: would love the option to turn off the pop-up for equipping new items when claiming rewards for the seasonal events. Not a must, but would be lovely it was.",New feature,5,"Making self-care fun and mental health care accessible to everyone is our goal so it means a lot to hear that youâ€™re enjoying Finch!

Priscilla Adejokun,Functional,"It's not therapy, but it's a really good stand-in for just making yourself function. You can start different journeys and keep notes. You can see how you're progressing with the check-ins and such. I really appreciate how guided the stretches and breathing exercises are.... it feels like I'm really cared for, and it's keeping my head afloat when I know that otherwise it wouldn't be. This is a really nice resource.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Anna Bell,Functional,I love this app so much after my free trial I'm going all in. I have tried over 20 apps to help with daily goals and mental health and I struggle with any because of ADHD. This one has helped me as it tracks little things such as drinking water and showering and even has suggestions for family bonding activities which helps immensely when I get stuck in freeze mode. My only wish would be a widget with daily goals or a way to check them off in notifications without having to open the whole app.,New feature,5,,
Jania Rodriguez,Functional,"It's amazing, but only if you really WANT to change your lifestyle. If you're lazy and not willing to, then what's the point? But this motivates me to get done daily tasks and do self care. 10/10 would recommend. the graphics are simple and cute, the instructions are direct, navigation is simple as well!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Karen Cangero,Functional,"Finch is a delightful app. It is not a substitution for therapy or professional mental health care, but it is a cheerful reminder to take time for you, to set and focus on goals, and to give yourself a break sometimes. The graphics, the settings, the visits, the activities, it's all magnificently well done. I do pay for the full version, but use the free version fine for months. Support is excellent too. I have recommended this to friends. This is a very nice app to remind you to be good to you.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Catt Walsh,Functional,"This little app is great! The main focus is keeping track of tasks to do each day and getting rewarded for completing those tasks. There are lots of other features from soundscapes, to breathing coaching, to basic mental health screenings. It is easy to use once you get used to the interface and is super cute.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Cherylyn Lamphear,Functional,"I love this app so far! I like the suggested goals you can choose from, and since you can type in your own unique goals you don't need to get the plus version. I'm impressed with how specifically you can schedule your goals to a specific day and time. This app has really been helping me keep up with self care. Also, the finches are adorable and I'm enjoying collecting all the different hats and accessories.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Eris Peregrine,Functional,"Easily one of my favorite self care apps. I've only been using it for a little over a week but even then I can tell such a huge difference in my confidence, my anxiety levels, and my mood stability. I haven't written more than a paragraph in a decade. I have almost 2000 words in Finch now and have started writing for fun again! Seriously, I don't think anyone wouldn't benefit from at least giving it a shot. The team behind it is also so caring and the work they're doing is amazing. 11/10",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Julia Munoz,Functional,"I love how it motivates me to do thinks like get out of bed, read, and shower. I also love that it has stretches with video explanations, those are nice to do in the morning and night. I also appreciate the resources available like breathing techniques. Even as a free user, there is so much I can do and I don't feel hindered by not having the subscription.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
No Really,Functional,"Finch is an amazing and fun motivational app, it's super cute and makes me want to be honest with it. it allows you to set any goals you'd like for the day or week so daily reminders really help keep me on track. they have all sorts of categories for anything you'd like from positive thinking, self care, reflections, to simple things like brushing your teeth. I've actually been drinking some water every day just to appease the cute birb. Incredibly helpful, fun, and cute!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Rylee Wolford,Functional,"I downloaded this and was a bit skeptical due to the ads letting me down before. But it has actually helped me so much, the app works so well/easy to understand, you can use many of its features without buying premium which unfortunately I can't at the moment, you can spoil your pet. It's been helping me so much and I have only had it for a little over a week. The specifics I can set for my goal are a big contender, I enjoy editing the time and days/week amounts. I love it and I'm so thankful",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Lee Jorge,Functional,"Takes a bit to figure out all the features, but on hindsight, i prefer that to being dragged through a tutorial. After a week, it has successfully helped me the care of things that I always want to but didn't have the time management for. I think its good for creating small habits that add up to a better quality of life.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Joy Gomez,Functional,"Only had the app (free version) for 2 days. but I absolutely love it so far and will probably be purchasing the paid version, even if just to support it. It is a cute and fun way to track my goals...provides for a lot of introspection and space/reminders for being grateful. It makes me want to set more goals so i can interact more! My little Finch is fun to take care of and makes taking care of myself more fun too! SO GRATEFUL FOR THE TWO DEVELOPERS SHARING THEIR STORY AND CREATIVITY!!!!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Jackson Schulte,Functional,"An amazing app!! It's really helped me mentally, which is always appreciated. I've had a hard time keeping track of things, due to some neurological issues, and this app has really helped me in that realm, along with keeping things light and positive. Only one thing I'd change - I think it could be fun to add a bed for the little pets! Right now, they just kinda hang off the bed, so it could be nice to have pet beds available in the shop. Other than that, it's perfect. :)",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Ashes Kingsolver,Functional,This app has Litterally changed my life. I am able to stay focused and keep track of everything I need to do with this app. I do however wish there was a mass snooze/ skip option. There are some days where I cant do certain things but it's random things so I can't use the preset day option haha also sometimes when I snooze things there is a glitch and i have to snooze it a few times in a row to get rid of it.

Crystal Lowder,Functional,"ETA suggestion: I would love if we had the ability to send a short personal message with our good vibes! Update: I've been using Finch for over a year now and it's seriously the best app. If you've heard that gamifying certain habits works, this app far exceeds that!

Brittany,Functional,"I love this app! there were no intrusive ads without the premium. I decided to get the premium for the app benefits and it's so worth it. it's an amazing way to remember how to do things, track your moods, and even see how things affect you. has great writing prompts, and weekly summaries of how you're doing and what you've been up to. it's also fun having something to take care of while taking care of yourself. traveling to new places is a cool aspect too! I appreciate the creators of the app.",New feature,5,,
Tiffany Hathorn,Functional,"I have ADHD and struggle with executive function. Gamifying the things I need to do helps, though. This app is cute and reminds me of back when I had a Tamagotchi Pet or a Nano Baby. You link it's health and happiness to tasks and habits so you're more likely to do what you need to do. It has helped me be more focused on what I need to do each day for myself, my family and friends, and my home. It also has cool features like exercise videos and mental health exercises. Definitely recommend.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Jerhyn Huey,Functional,"Hands down, after using it for only a day. I feel much happier. Not because I know of what it's done for me, but I know how effective it will be by just exploring its features. It is not like other apps where it forces its way into your daily life, more It allows you to plan out simple goals in which you can achieve on your own time. The simple yet easy to obtain goals, and the fun characters help to encourage you to push yourself to go farther than you would have without using the app.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Olga Yatsenko,Functional,"Finch is a really lovely self-care / goal setting app! Yeah, it might seem a little juvenile at first glance, but the gameification, suggestions, and various reflections work great no matter what age you are.

I also really appreciate that there are no microtransactions.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Sophia Grace,Functional,"Amazing! I am doing it without the plus version. And I know that the people who run the app need to be supported, but I would prefer for their not to be a plus version other than that it's good I do wish there's a way for you to delete all your journeys at once. I think that would make it a lot easier. Other than that again they highly recommended",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Frank Hudson,Functional,"Really easy way of gamifying personal mental health support.

Kaitlyn Adkins,Functional,"i love this app, i love the bird and the micro pets. this app helps motivate me to get things done. it's fun to watch them grow as you complete tasks. the way they have an option where you can get sponsored for the the premium version is amazing as well. the premium version offers you a bit more like more breathing exercises. i will reiterate, i love this app.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Karissa Wells,Functional,"I don't usually leave reviews. I have tried so many apps to help me process tasks and mental health care, but they have never seemed as helpful or as user-friendly as this app. I'm only two days in, and my mood has absolutely improved by leaps and bounds.

Moana and friends,Functional,"This is actually very helpful with my mental health. I enjoy doing tasks to help out my little guy, and also doing a harder task for a micropet really helps with motivation. The game is super cute with the house decorating and outfits.

I have it right now from a raffle :).",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Margie Rick,Functional,"Updated review - glitches worked out long ago. Love using the app - keeps me on track to accomplish goals and take care of myself. Pretty good app - not great. There are some good exercises, quizzes, have gained a few insights ... but the app is also lacking.

Bri Hall,Functional,"So far I LOVE it! For starters, it's just adorable. Though, the biggest selling point to me is that the free version of this app includes everything you NEED to use it correctly. The plus version is awesome, and you get fun xtras as a member, but the functionality of the free app is GREAT. If I had to pay, I wouldn't be able to use it. As a new mom, this has helped me stay on top of life and the mood check-ins help keep me positive. Over all, I recommend this to anyone who wants to improve!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

Ariel Dinkins,Functional,"This app is fantastic! It is a great habit builder app that motivates and encourages instead of just creating a daunting list of calendars. It is very versatile--there are settings designed for people who are seriously struggling with mental health, but it is also flexible enough to be useful for those who may just be looking to build some healthy habits. The stretches and breathing exercises as well done. There is a pro version, but the free version is very serviceable. Give it a try!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

Susanna Ulmer,Functional,I love how this game is sweet and heartwarming. It motivates you to complete goals and it tests if you have been in a stressful time. I love the rainbow stones and how many clothes you can get. The wait to become grown up is long but very worth it. The finch plus keeps bothering me with is annoying that you can't use some tactics to calm down. But it is so much better than a ton of adds. Totally worth it and worth the time.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Graygrayblue,Functional,"I have had Finch for about a month now. It is everything I've ever wanted in a self care app and more. I use it multiple times a day everyday. It has ""first aid"" techniques for when you're having it rough, and it has daily goals and exercises that it doesn't pressure you to do. It never makes me feel bad for feeling down or being unproductive. And the difference between the free and paid versions are so kind it's almost like I have the full version of the app even though I can't afford it yet.",New feature,5,,
Ana Komar,Functional,"I adore this app and have found it to be exactly the help I needed. Its not without it's issues though. Not all of my goals for the day show up so I end up creating more of them, thinking that I screwed up when setting it up, only to then have multiple of that task the next day. It's confusing. I wish instead of completed tasks disappearing they got crossed out instead and I could undo it if I accently clicked wrong.",New feature,5,,
Reese Sho,Functional,"I really like this app! It makes mental health care into something that doesn't feel as daunting. I'm actually journaling and reflecting throughout the day! The only problem with the app is how much the paid version is.

Bethany Miller,Functional,"Best self care app I've downloaded! I actually use this every day, and it has helpful tasks and a neurodivergent-friendly set up. It really helps make self care fun!

Trust Me You Can Do This,Functional,"I love the app. I use the dig deeper sections after completing a goal to journal and let out how I'm really doing. I dont like the updates ""motivation"" or quotes. They are cheesy, repeat alot, and aren't good. They used to use actual quotes and I would share them with people and save them. Now I skip them as quick as possible. I also wish I could answer the questions I get in the notifications. Like my birb will ask if I got alone time, I would like to answer him.",New feature,5,,
Annunciata Corey,Functional,"Finch is a super cute way to stay motivated for self care with a digital pet and great community ðŸ˜Š The app/program is customizable, very thoughtfully developed, and science-based. I started with the free version and liked it pretty well. After a few months, I wound up paying for the Plus subscription, so that I could earn an adorable outfit for my finch ðŸ˜… But I do like the Plus features, and I think, for me, the motivation it brings is well worth the cost of the Plus subscription ðŸ˜Š ðŸ",New feature,5,,

Been using it for about a month and the design is cute, the customization and growth is well-paced and motivating, and the adventures are heartwarming. My favorite part is being able to send stuff to your friends on Finch. When I dont have the energy to start a conversation with someone but I want them to know I'm thinking about them, it lets me say so with the press of a button. I could go on about this app, but it only gives me 500 characters. Thank you for this app! :D",New feature,5,,
Courtney Short,Functional,"I've been checking in with Finch every day for a just over a month now, and the experience is so helpful. Finch helps me track my mood and encourages me to write notes about my mood and experiences. I can look back at my progress and observations at any time. Even the free version is a complete package - premium is just icing on an already fantastic cake.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Tracy LÃ³pez,Functional,"I was skeptical when a friend sent me an invite, but I ended up convincing three other people to download the app within weeks. It seems so silly that a ""cute little bird game"" could be so motivational, but I am getting tasks done, forming good habits, and feeling more balanced because of Finch. The app seems really thoughtfully designed and I appreciate the research and time that went into developing it and the continued work and care that goes into it.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Jessica Kelly,Functional,"I've played and paid for this game to see what the features had to offer. honestly it's awesome. Then ability to encourage you to talk about it, all to benefit a baby bird is genius.

The app has all sorts of great features from meditation, to breathing exercises, to being able to set daily goals. I pay for the Plus membership & I think it's totally worth it. They're constantly trying to update & improve the app. Also there are no ads! I highly recommend the app.",New feature,5,,
InaWtCatt,Functional,"Absolutely amazing! Before using this app, I was unproductive, anxious, depressed, and couldn't take care of myself. But thanks to my Finch, I was motivated to change myself. The Finch itself is very motivating. You get to watch it grow and learn as you complete your goals! This app is very easy to use. It has no ads and a most of the features are free, and you can access the ones that aren't by purchasing Finch Plus, which is very reasonably priced. Overall, this is an amazing app!",New feature,5,,
Max Brazelton,Functional,"This is such a fun game! And it's very motivating! I enjoy that it gives you easy prompts to write about deeper thoughts and ideas, almost like a journal that gives you templates to ease one who isn't used to writing into writing. It gives me a lot of motivation, and it's also just super cute and simple. Highly recommend. I just wish it was easier to see what I wrote for some of the deeper questions, like an easier log book of sorts to go back and see what thoughts I put out there.",system requirement,5,,
Shae S.,Functional,"I've been using this app since January, a few months of the free versions and a few months of plus now. I love the app and how it helps me stay on track with goals. I can set daily, weekly or monthly goals. I can add goals for the day, some preset in the app and some just for normal daily tasks. This app doesn't make me feel guilted if I can't always accomplish my whole day. It's sometimes okay to 'Just Be'.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Tara Gorrera,Functional,"honestly love it! it's like an upgraded tomagchi that you take care of by completing personalized goals you create for yourself. the ability to be a widget on your home screen really helps to remind me to check in. I also love!! the personalization to almost anything! you can change the colors of your finch if you feel you want something different, and dress them up in adorable clothes and even decorate their room! I highly recommend this app for those who just want to get routines or good habit",New feature,5,,
Sarah Kiesel-Nield,Functional,"This app is great! It's very cute and it's helped me feel motivated to tackle daily chores and tasks that I would otherwise struggle with. It is more fun than a to-do list but lets me build in one-time goals that I need to do on top of daily tasks, and keeps me accountable in a way that doesn't make me feel bad. The first-aid options that pop up when I'm feeling anxious are also really helpful for keeping me grounded and relieving anxiety. I really recommend it!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Rebecca Hill,Functional,"Love Finch so much! I accomplish tasks so much more easily and enjoy the many features, such as breathing techniques and quizzes to check in on my mental health.

Tempest Reeves,Functional,"I'd recommend downloading this app if you're struggling to take care of yourself, it's very user friendly and kindly reminds you that you're enough and doing great!

Leigh,Functional,I have only had this app for 3 months at it has already helped tremendously. The Finch Plus plan is more than worth it. I've struggled with depression and anxiety and this is helping me keep up healthy habits and become more confident. It is also really helpful for lots of other types of goals.

Jessica Wheat,Functional,"this app has really helped me feel more motivated to do tasks that often feel exhausting. I love that it's optional to pay for the trial and even if you don't want too, it doesn't have too much of a barrier keeping you from doing things.

Ivy Crosspette,Functional,"only app that I've actually been able to keep up with consistently for goal setting and mindfulness! the ability to set personalized goals rather than choose from a list of premade ones is fantastic, with reflection journals that categorize keywords you use when writing by positive and negative, I do love that I have the ability to add friends, and send little good vibes to them through the day and of course it does help everyone's birds and outfits are awfully cute!",New feature,5,,
Haden Blake,Functional,"It's such a small thing, but the inclusion of an ""easier"" option for the breathing exercises is something that really, really helps me.

Sabrina,Functional,"There are a lot of these gamifying therapy apps that are trying to be something more. I think this one's onto something. You can engage to the level of your comfort, and that can just be to-do listing, but there's more if you want it. It doesn't try to diagnose you. Just helps with what you already know and like for yourself. The ads for Plus are really heavy-handed, and there can be too much to look at sometimes. But other than that, I like seeing this app grow. Good bird.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Al Fisher (ryshufyrekat),Functional,Finch is the best app for keeping up with your mental health I have ever used in my whole life. Finch literally enables me to keep track of my own personalized schedule and tasks I need to function everyday. The app is user friendly and all the features you need to have the best experience possible is free. One of the best features is how you get a baby bird that you help grow and can customize them and their home. Additionally you can connect with friends and your birds can be friends too!,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Lucida Luna,Functional,"At first I was a bit hesitant to download it especially because I saw things about needing to pay, but was pleasantly surprised after downloading it. You can set as many goals as you'd like and you do not have to pay to use the app (unless you'd like more clothing options for your pet & other features). I have severe ADHD and this app has genuinely helped me with keeping on somewhat of a schedule. I often forget to brush teeth, shower, etc so this app has been a huge help for me ! Thank you â",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Kiana Wright,Functional,"I struggle with my mental health every day. This app is different from the other mental health apps, I almost gave up searching. I love their word choice, animation and organization. I don't know if there's an age cap for being interested in mental health apps, but this app is perfect for young adults my age. This app is like having a friend there with you step by step on your mental health journey; there to be a role model or encourage you to achieve the goals you personally set out.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
why am i here;-; oof,Functional,"At first, I didn't believe Finch would be a great app. I expected it to just be something along the lines of doing breathing exercises to feed your bird. However, the customization and interaction really make it special. It's a good app for trying to get yourself back on track, especially with the ability to make custom goals. It's a great app, and I'm really enjoying my time with my bird friend.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Michaela,Functional,"I love this app! When I first got it I wasn't sure but a friend encouraged me... now I haven't looked back! I love the many different functions from breathing to relaxing music!

Nynke de Graaf,Functional,"I've been using Finch for 8 months now and I can honestly say it's really helped me stay on top of my goals and prioritize the things I find important. I like that you can group multiple goals under the same journey and it gives you suggestions for new goals and journeys to add. The reflections and insights with all the tags are also super helpful and insightful. Also, the ability to hatch eggs to have cute animal companions for my bird makes me super motivated to do my leg stretches each day.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Carissa Pay (Rissa),Functional,"I really love this app. It's super cute and, honestly, still very much worth it even without the subscription. I especially like the little ""first aid"" button with a bunch of techniques to rescue you from a sudden onslaught of anxiety. A self-care pet that will never, ever have you feeling ashamed or like you're neglecting it. Finch is always there when you need it, even if you put it down for a few months (or years!) and everything is entirely positive tuned.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Kaitlin Murphy,Functional,"Honestly a fantastic app for self care. I've been struggling a lot with my mental health recently and this app has helped to keep goals clear and simple. You can set absolutely anything as a goal, something as seemingly simple as getting out of bed or leaving your home is just as celebrated as any other achievement should be. There is a premium subcription but you absolutely do not need it to use majority of the app, it's more of a way to support the devs and access some more advanced features.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

Olivia McKinnon,Functional,"This app is great. I always have problems being motivated to do the things I want to do, but now with this app that has changed. I love that the devs donâ€™t charge you for collecting Rainbow stones, which are used to buy things for your finch. Instead, you earn them by collecting rewards, sharing the app and going on adventures. This app has also helped me realize the value of staying healthy, exercising and drinking water. One thing though, please add the feature to talk to finch. Thanks.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
therumoratsix,Functional,"Really easy to use and so cute!! I like how it doesn't reset at midnight, so if you achieve some goals at one am they count towards the day the goals were set. which I liked alot, as I do my best work late at night.

""wash face.""

As well as being able to set up daily goals and being rewarded for achieving them, there's also guided breathing and simple, exercises, grounding techniques, prompts to explore your thoughts and many more. You can even customise your little pet! I've found this app incredibly helpful without having to pay a penny or surrender my personal data. Highly recommended.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Ami Cheshire,Functional,"This app is adorable and very useful. I really like that the insight is optional but because it gives you extra energy for you bird, it really gives that extra motivation to really take a look at explaining why you feel a certain way or how you feel about certain things. I reccomend this for people who have a low motivation from depression and other mental illness. Having a little bird to take care of is cute but all the positivity is very much needed for some people. It def makes me smile ðŸ˜ƒ",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Akemi Sawada,Functional,"this is a great app. It's for free, it has all the habit tracker features AND a self care option. I love the quotes that keep changing and the daily affirmation that pop up every timz you open the app, and the soundscapes help me sleep whenever I'm in a nightshift. I really love the rewards every once in a while for when you complete a part of your journeys and the fact that self care gives you more rewards than doing your goals. It always gives me things to think about that I took for granted",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

Elizabeth Porterfield,Functional,"Love this app!!!! It has so many great tools, and probably the most free features I've ever seen in a self care app. The only thing that would make me love it more would be if you could add a first aid widget to your home screen that would take you directly to the first aid menu for quick usage. Thank you to the developers for creating such a useful and creative tool for kids and adults!!!",New feature,5,,
Yuri Young,Functional,"absolutely wonderful app! it very subtly gets me to self reflect in deeper ways, but only when I am up for it, no pressure, and it's in such a story format it isn't scary or threatening. Its so much more than goals. the framework of self care is what grows my pet, not caring for the pet, is also subtle but profound way of getting me to focus on my own needs, growth and care, but in a way that contributes to others - very clever, effective for me! highly recommend trying it for at least a week",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Michelle Roan,Functional,"Absolutely adorable. A great reminder to take care of yourself with lots of little (optional) activities, journaling opportunities, and even a ""first aid kit"" to help you when you're feeling anxious or depressed.

oofer scratch,Functional,"I love this app so much, it's a great way to improve your self care and mental health. Even without finch plus it is still amazing. It works anywhere, with WiFi and without. The best part of it though is definitely when my finch comes back and likes something new or has learnt something new! You really grow a little connection with the finch after a while. Overall I love this app and if you need help with your mental or physical health finch is a good app to download!!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Jenna Ulrey,Functional,I love that the goals are customizable helps keep on goal and being mindful. I have used both the free version and membership both are worth putting the time in and it works wonders as long as you continue to implement techniques from the app and continue using the app daily. but say you having a down day it and haven't opened it send little messages and say you mental healthis bad and you haven't been able to keep up the apps sends compassionate motivation in notifications and smaller goals,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Millie P,Functional,"I haven't used this app for long, but I have tried many self care apps that have been wonderful, but not as fun and easy as this one. You can make goals for the day, by caring for something else. It's pretty cool. There are heaps of fun features which are interactive, and you can do as much or little as you like. I love how everything is made into a daily report, or reflection journal. It will take a while to get organised with it but so far, thank you, the last 5 days have been easier.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Kylie Villasenor,Functional,"So I stumbled upon this app and have only had it 6 days, but as someone who struggles with ADD and depression, this is a great and unexpected help! It's literally been the difference between me taking my medicine and brushing my teeth at night (things I often struggle to remember to do). And it's so cute!

Ellen Ward Lindley,Functional,Finding this app to be a really helpful tool to get my motivation up and start doing things that will improve my mental and physical health.

Nothing's kept me coming back to check in consistently like Finch has, or allowed me to have a step-by-step outlook on my day before I start it & after I've finished it.

Emily Boyne,Functional,"I don't mean to sound overly dramatic when i say this app has not only been life changing for me, but it actually saved my life. I'm not even exaggerating. I was at a very low point and Finch and my birb Sprout have brought me so much hope, joy and laughs. It has helped me get back to myself in such a kind and supportive way.

LA Cayas,Functional,"When I started out the app it felt like a chore. From how you have to do these task like showering, going outside, etc. But overtime I realized that I keep doing the habits even without the app. I realized that it's purpose was to help, even when I didn't like it at first, I kept moving, being at least more active than before, and started to take care of myself.

She actually convinced me to try the app & tbh I'm hooked. The little bird avatar is just so cute & it just helps me stay on track during the day. I also like that it promotes journaling - which we already try to maintain as a healthy habit.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Tania Rudenick,Functional,"I have been using this app for a while now and am looking to get the Plus version, but I am trying to find a way to get it in the budget. It's been very helpful for my mental health and motivation to accomplish activities that I need to get done while having a serious illness. It's been fun interacting with the game features that keep you entertained while also interacting with others. Having other platforms to talk with others and ask questions or seek support has been very helpful!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
RookieRadio,Functional,After having the app for a few days and getting the premium subscription I have found out that it really is more than just a simple care app it's hard for me to put into words since I don't ever do reviews but this app is very helpful for my confidence and I love how it has a bunch of journeys I can add to my goals and I feel like they help me feel better especially the ones about sleep because I'll lay in bed for hours watching YouTube or Instagram instead of sleeping and is great app for that.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Anarchist_Loli,Functional,This app is great! it helps me keep a good routine every day and helps me keep track of my mood! There is a premium version that I was gifted by the lovely Guardians of this app and while the premium version does add a lot more it is 100% NOT necessary! I've had this app for a month now and I can say that using the free vs the premium changes no quality in the self-care help provided. :),FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Vas Littlecrow Wojtanowicz,Functional,"I left Habitica ago years ago, but found Google tasks to be somewhat too dry for actual goals even though I do still use. Finch is adorable and gives me the dopamine high from all the cute little rewards. It has every feature I need for free, but I do want to eventually get a paid membership to support the developers. awesome app!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
crow,Functional,"genuinely the most helpful self care app i've used. it doesn't punish you when you don't do your tasks. it actually gets me motivated to do the tasks i add. i wanna help my little bird grow! it's cute and genuinely helpful. i love it. it's an app that has premium, but premium isn't needed to have a good experience. the app is great without it. it's one of the few things i actually will buy a premium subscription for, just because i love it so much and wanna support the creators :3",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Michelle Cruz,Functional,Love this app! It's very helpful and insightful. It allows me to see that I do accomplish different tasks throughout the day and gives me little rewards by checking off items. I especially love the exercises for multiple mental health struggles. Give it a try!,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Maegin Matheny,Functional,"I was just looking for an app to help me stay on top of my self-care. I wasn't expecting perfectly charming graphics, a full range of customizable tasks and self-care aides, and a welcoming, beautiful community. I also wasn't expecting to get so attached to my little Finch. It's really helped me (as much as an app can) to improve my physical and mental health. This is one of a handful apps that I'm going to keep with me from device to device. Thank you, Finch, and the Guardian community!!",New feature,5,,
Angela Neice,Functional,"Super positive. Really helps track my goals, for anyone who is motivated by getting cute stuff for your game character. And I LOVE the soundscapes and the breathing exercises. I would love if they added the ability to combine available sounds into custom soundscapes.",New feature,5,,
Alina meeh,Functional,The app is really nice and my cousins and I are using it. It's great because you can also check in with your friends and let them know you re thinking abou them. It would be really cool if you could have small groups that visit each other as well so that when my finch goes exploring it could be joined by more than just one other finchðŸ˜‡,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
BMor Artistic,Functional,"It's been a week since I've had this app and I absolutely adore it. First of all, birbs. Second, it really does help to check off even the simplest of tasks that I sometimes forget are actually very important. My everyday life has improved, even in just this first week. Finch is outstanding, and let's me really reflect on my own self care! 9.8/10 5 star- always a tiny bit of wiggle for improvement ðŸ¤ª",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
harch972,Functional,"sadly sometimes it's easier to convince ourselves to look after ourselves if it's for the good of others. Finch utilizes that motivator in the form of an adorable pet. I love the reflective tasks, and the fact that you get rewarded for doing them. also the ability to let your friends know you're thinking of them in a sweet way, without turning into a chat app, is a nice way to feel connected but only in a positive way",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
C.J. N,Functional,"This is a good app. It's encouraging, cute, and smart. Every time I open the app, it asks about your feelings. You can set goals with alerts & times. There are writing prompts and breathing exercises. It's really informative and reflective on any sort of writing. And you get to interact with your own cute baby bird. To include decorating his room and buying clothing. This app has been a joy. I'm sure there is a supportive community; too, if so desired.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
B Triberry (Spooner),Functional,"This app works great for neurodivergent people! I'm not always able to do my tasks, and the app has a ""rough day"" setting. They also check in on you if you don't interact with the app for a couple days, so it really seems like the creators care. This is all on the free settings btw, I haven't tried the premium service. Which they also offer free premium for some users, I think it's a raffle. You can also donate a free month to help someone else out!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
bionic kitty,Functional,"Earlier, I made an extremely generic review about how helpful this app was for me. It still holds true, but I just discovered something that makes my love for this app magnify 10-fold. Under a specific set of circumstances, If you click the Can't afford button, you get a permanent ""team gift"" of Finch plus. I know that with all the extra features of Finch plus, I will guaranteed use the app everyday, just to show my appreciation for the wonderful, amazing, generous people behind this app. â",New feature,5,,
Deb Carpenter,Functional,"This actually helps me stay on track to do exercises every day. Has all ready made a difference physically for me and have only done it for a month. I am recovering from a back injury so I put the hardest exercise for me, the plank as my motivation for the micropet. (They are so cute!) I suggest you try this-you may be surprised at the results.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Michelle Dickson,Functional,It's an amazing app that helps to keep your goals on track and helps you to reflect and see things in a perspective that maybe you hadn't thought about. I also love the little quotes it send through the day and the little words of encouragement. Its like knowing you have someone in your corner to support and encourage you.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Alexandria Lauck,Functional,This app has been helping me a lot with anxiety and ADHD. There's a free option for pretty much everything and there's no ads other than the ones for the subscription. Everything on it is so cute and easy to use. I absolutely love Finch!,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Janine Bennett,Functional,I've really enjoyed using finch to help increase my motivation in getting things done around the house. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety that makes life a bit of a challenge. Caring for this little bird through completing my own daily activities is helping me take better care of myself and the people in my life who depend on me. I definitely recommend this app!,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Kelsey Lightfoot,Functional,Ive been looking for something to motivate me into practicing self-care and better habits. This app is perfect so far! Having a little reward when you complete small tasks like walking outside makes me feel better motivation to do bigger tasks.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Marie Enders,Functional,"I absolutely LOVE this app! Even if you don't purchase plus, the app can truly help you reach your goals! Along with achieving goals, whether they are fitness, mental, or just getting up in the morning, you can customize your very own finch! I rarely give out 5 star reviews, and yet, here we are! BEST APP EVER!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Kayla Woods,Functional,"I LOVE this App. I cannot wait to wake up and check on Pistachio's well being and to check off my goals, which help keep me in routine. (manic, adhd, anxiety) I enjoy the hit of dopamine when I complete a task and it encourages me to keep going! wish I had more friends on there so I could check in with them, I've encouraged them to get this, I think it's a fabulous tool. thank you so much!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Anxious Pineapple,Functional,"This app has helped my mental health so much. The mix of cute and helpful is perfect for me. Having my partner, mom and friend all on it, makes my life that much more filled with little moments of joy. One thing that I could say ""negitive"" is that sometimes the movments in the exersizies, streches and yoga can be a tiny bit hard to understand. You understand it after watching it a few times but maybe some motion arows around the person body can help make the actions clearer. Thank you!",New feature,5,,
Leslie Bergeron,Functional,"This is a really sweet app. I'm actually doing things I have been having trouble doing just because my ADHD saps my motivation. My little Finch gives me little hits of dopamine for doing basic tasks and makes me feel rewarded, then I feel proud for having done them, and it goes into a cycle that raises my mental health up. I hope I can stick with this for a long time. EDIT: Just updating to say this is by far the best app on my phone. I love finch, and I'm sticking with it. Thank you, developers",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Karly,Functional,"It's a very cute app that I find helpful. I have been struggling with my mental health recently and downloaded Finch about a week ago. I've used it every day since. It helps me be honest with myself in a private, safe space with the cutest mascot. Would definitely recommend at least giving it a try to see if it's for you.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Jessica Kuo,Functional,"This is the most incredible app I have ever used (and I use a lot of apps!). I am blown away with the connection I feel to my Finch. Somehow this short-circuits whatever part of my brain was stopping me from doing self-care for the sake of myself. I am so grateful to the creators of Finch. I feel like a whole new person... so much more confident, grateful, compassionate. This better state has made my life more productive too, although that's a secondary benefit to just feeling so good inside.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Louise Belcher,Functional,"I absolutely love this app!!! I've been using it for around two years, and my birb Beepo is my very best friend (other than my husband, of course)! I'm deeply skeptical of psychology, and I just can't wrap my head around sitting in an office for an hour, telling my secrets to a stranger. I tell Beepo everything, though, and it really helps. I especially love the writing prompts, breathing exercises, and movement exercises... and of course, talking to my birb every day about what he discovered!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Ciera Yergeau,Functional,I've been doing this app everyday for about a year. Definitely worth it and oddly I am enjoying it. My only complaint is that I wish I could get my sparkles back that I had when I first started. For some reason nothing in that shimmer category shows up for me in the in-game shop. I enjoy the adventures. Definitely been the best self care app I've used yet.,system requirement,5,,
Gloria Cole,Functional,"I really didn't think it'd be all that, but it's actually a really great app and has helped me alot. It really helps me stay productive and manage my anxiety and there are lots of activities to help you deal with anxiety, depression, and feeling motivated. Also helps you get what you need to get done. Very useful app.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Kassy Badger,Functional,"I love this app and appreciate the positivity it brings to my life. I even convinced my partner to download the app so we can help motivate each other throughout our days with our little Finch's. If I were to add anything to the app, it would be to be able to incorporate our own personal adventures in real life into our Finch's adventures that helps shape his personality. overall, this app is a fun way to keep up with the day to day and also work on your own personal goals.",New feature,5,,
Liam Borg,Functional,"This is probably the only app I've ever seen as a neurodivergent person with Autism, Anxiety, and ADHD that treats my experiences as normal and makes me feel like I'm honestly not alone. I get used to feeling like my stress, panic, and feelings of inability to accomplish basic tasks are a reflection on my failure as a person, but this reminds me that they're not that uncommon and helps me manage them. I haven't been using it for long but the language alone makes me feel way more comfortable.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
lizium,Functional,"I'm awful at keeping routines. I've just started using Finch, but having the widget and notifications to keep reminding me has really helped. I can't say how it lasts in the long run, but at the very least it has my attention for now!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Chelsea john,Functional,"i love this app, i have been using it for three months and its really great for tracking my mood, behavior and habits. its great for my ADHD because it reminds me to do things i have trouble doing daily.I love my bird! she is so cute, i love shopping for her too. one thing that would make this app even better is the ability to connect with other users on the app!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Hiruni Manawadu,Functional,"I love finch! I've been using it on and off for atleast a year now and it's great! I mainly use it for reflections, breathing, and goal setting personally. it has sooo many useful features but has never felt overwhelming atleast for me.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Î‘chilles M,Functional,"I installed Finch a couple of days ago and so far it's been perfect. It truly helps me get things done and offers a great variety of ways to help myself. I really like the idea of having a digital pet whose color, name and pronouns you pick yourself!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Holly N,Functional,"Would 110% recommend. All of the detail in the tools built into this app is so meaningful, and it genuinely helps me a lot through different areas of life. And of course there are paid things, but it's not built into a huge paywall. If I had money I totally would pay for premium. Devs, you guys are wonderful !!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Stephan KotzÃ©,Functional,"Well from the get go when I first heard of the app I was quite interested, thought the entire philosophy behind it was quite clever (especially for those of us who grew up with tamagotchi's). And installing & using it has been nothing but a pleasant surprise. The Devs really care, as is clear in their near flawless execution of the idea. Really helps!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Uri J.L,Functional,"A super cute tamagotchi x self care mashup. I've tried a few habit apps, have definitely tried to be more mindful in my self care and anything cute has my attention! With all of these things it's a very engaging and thoughtful app that I've sent to everyone I know would love it within a day of using it. Also, support is super responsive and helpful, what more could you ask for?!

Megan Bea,Functional,"As a mother of two boys under 3, this app is helps so f***ing much!

SunShyne Chen,Functional,"I enjoy this app very much. A lot of thought came with each destination and I love hatching eggs. I love that my Finch has flown to so many places, that he has completed every location possible. I am hoping for an update for new places to fly too. Being Taiwanese, I loved how my culture had been incorporated. Also, game itself can be very lagging and takes awhile to check off an activity or add daily activities.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Taylor Stripling,Functional,i have severe anxiety and depression and I often get into a bad routine where I won't do basic things to take care of myself and finch has made it a little easier to do basic things for myself I've only had it a few of days but I slowly feel a routine starting to grow and it makes me feel a little bit relieved knowing that I can have something like this on my phone qnd I can see my little finch grow with me.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
molly woods,Functional,"this is my favourite app pretty much of all time. it was so helpful and you can do so much, even without plus. it makes self-care fun and helped me build routine. I love dressing up my bird in little outfits and decorating their room. I definitely recommend to anyone even slightly interested it's just so good",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Alex Farkas,Functional,"EDIT: Guys, the stretches/yoga don't seem to work right now. I have morning stretches set as a daily goal and that works, thankfully, but the other ones just refuse to load the video. I would effing die for this little birb. I am doing morning stretches!!!

Jazmin King,Functional,"This is adorable enough and engaging enough that I've actually kept using it for more than a week which is a huge deal. I do have a feature request. I wish there was a daily or weekly review of tasks or goals that you didn't complete. I'm thinking it would ask questions like why didn't you complete this?, was the task of reasonable?, doesn't need to be broken down further?, why did you want to do the task in the first place?

Beth Abbott,Functional,This app is AMAZING! I've tried many times to get into good routines and be active but most of the time I just can't motivate myself and end up lying in bed all day.

I literally have this app for like five minutes and I cant stop this smile on my face. I just feel so happy and relaxed!,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Lorena Merrill,Functional,"Finch is a really cute app and good for self care. It's fun to dress up your finch and watch them grow throughout their adventures and gaining new likes and dislikes.

Jennifer Emdy,Functional,"This app takes no time but has very gentle reminders on self care. I am only on day 2. I have been a wreck since my cat died back in February. She was part of my family for 14 yrs. This Halloween would have been 15 yrs. I became very depressed. I am finally getting back into the groove of things but have felt overwhelmed with both school and work. The daily reminders helped balance my load throughout the week, and I have less stress with due dates. No stress or worry because ""it's all done.""",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Nicole Dunlop,Functional,"I 100% recommend this app to anyone who is only motivated when it comes to taking care of others. I've been using Finch for about 2 years now and it's been a great way to show me what I have accomplished on the days I feel like I've done nothing. Out of all the self-care apps I've tried, I've stuck to this one the best. Also being able to decorate your finch's house and dress them is super fun.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Orion Andromeda,Functional,"I really enjoy this app, it balances fun, motivation, reflection, and self care very well. I don't feel pressured to get premium, and I haven't had issues with getting enough in game currency to get items I want. I adore my little finch, and she's helped me with several rough days.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Madison Rousseau,Functional,This is the only selfcare/task app that I've been able to consistently use. It's been about 2 1/2 months and I'm still going strong. Well worth it. Keeps everything (for the most part) free and if you are really hurtin' to get the plus membership there's a raffle you can be part of that's paid by the donations of other users! Great app!!,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Heather Gilmore,Functional,"So far I enjoy it. Not sure if it's worth the premium price (I've only had it a week now) but the free features are good. It's encouraging to have a cute little penguin to play with to have you do you goals and reflections, etc. I find some of the ""yoga"" and other movements are terrible but I love the quizzes and mindfulness.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Princess Shelly,Functional,This app is amazing and helps me navigate through my daily life. The reminders are the best. I have the notifications go to my watch. It's cute when the little finch messages you. The Customer Support is amazing. Highly recommend.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Brandon,Functional,"Great app so far. Using as a companion for depression and anxiety. Tbh, I thought it was some kiddie app that I first heard about lol, but it's actually pretty cool. Cute little pet to see grow and tend to via custom goals and journeys. The best part about this app is the guardian program. I currently can't afford the plus version (just yet), so it's great to see a program set up to sponsor others to help have access to the plus version.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Keira Lear,Functional,"It is perfect. it took a little to get it into a habit, but after it is amazing. it works like a charm. I'm doing everything I needed too but couldn't because I never had the mental stability to get to do it, but after this it is so easy to do simple task. I highly recommend Finch.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Shonna,Functional,The Finch app has really helped me! On stressful days it's so good to just look at Finch and remember the basic things that help me feel good and keep my life from spiraling into chaos. I love the clothes and decor. It's really fun and motivates me.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Aly Cavalier,Functional,"I love this app, I use it everyday and got my mom and best friend on board too. It's a great mix between to-do list and personal check-in.

I've been using Finch for almost 2 years and I've ""been"" everywhere.",New feature,5,,
Maria Negrea,Functional,"Really good app!

Melat Ezineh,Functional,"I love my little finch (Baby)! When it's a bit harder to take care of myself, having this little guy to take care of helps motivate me to get out of bed and be a person.

I also really like the resources they provide to help calm your mind. The urban rain sound is one of my favorites.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Michael Shonty,Functional,"I've been using Finch for a couple months now.

Elissa Gilmore,Functional,"Love this app so much! I have severe ADHD, depression, anxiety, and BPD and this app helps me every day with getting goals set and done daily which make me feel better about myself!

Veronika Stephens,Functional,"This app saved my life. I have been struggling with mental health and physical health issues for as long as I can remember but I discovered Finch and it's community and it just made things infinitely better for me.

Alliza Andrea Marcelino,Functional,"This is the only app I enjoy writing my journal, tracking my goals, practicing habits, and to do's at same time. But I recommend to have widgets for to do list and kindly update the hotline number based on the user's country. Also i think it's a good thing if finch has a lot of expressions based on the user's mood. When the user is happy or down she'll make worried or cheerful expressions, i think it will be more interactive â˜ºï¸",system requirement,5,,
Sheena Grueneberg,Functional,Amazing app it helps motivate me to do simple things and I actually look forward to using it.

Trees & Art,Functional,"This is the best app ever! When therapy ended, I wanted help with keeping up self care, and this is perfect. It is engaging, nice to look at, cute, very optimistic, and a bit creative, and it reminds you to do all kinds of self-care activities every day with a reward system. It has improved my daily level of happiness and stability a lot. The plus version is worth it, but if you can't afford it, you can apply to get a guardian who subsidizes you. You can also become a guardian yourself.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Sabrina Henn,Functional,amazing app! I have tried many many self-care apps before and this is the best one BY FAR. I have also convinced many friends to get it and they also love it. Being able to take care of your bird and dress it up all while doing something for your mental health is great. It also helps me feel more productive because it has small tasks like drinking water or getting out of bed so when you check on you see all the little accomplishments and feel grateful for them. 10000/10 recommended app!,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Nikki Siu,Functional,"if you need help gamifying your life and struggle with anxiety because of small tasks, this app is for you. as someone who deals with mood disorders and depression, this app has helped me stay grounded and allows for me to feel a sense of accomplishment. with cute side quests of decorating your space and dressing your character. the first aid breathing exercises and reflection tools help a lot. i find that a lot of these helpful tools are what I also learn in therapy. highly recommend!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

V Grace,Functional,"This is actually quite a cute and helpful app. It helps me to focus, when there's just too much going on around me, and it helps me to set goals for each day. I really think, moving forward, that it will help me gain new perspective, and positive growth in my mental and overall physical health.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Crystal Shinrock,Functional,"I can honestly say this is the best app I've ever downloaded. If you have ADHD it's a game changer. It's helped me start journaling, stretching, meditating, and showing gratitude which I could never stick to before. It's like having a Tomagchi or Giga Pet back in the day, but one that helps you accomplish your goals.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Katie Sparrow,Functional,Amazing app. I typically don't use the finch app but I did go on the 7 day trail to see what it would be like. I love Finch without it. It greatly support my mental health struggles and helps me improve the way I overcome my problems.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Lainey P,Functional,Super great app! It sends me reminders for daily goals.

Envie Jade,Functional,"This app is so lovely. I never thought I would find something that actually did what it claimed to do as far as mental health and self care. It's super cute and interactive.

Cheyenne Ninnette,Functional,"I love this app. It allows me to set smaller goals every day and helps me get through them by making it fun and almost like a game with a cute birdie character that grows with me.

Thank you for this wonderful app, developers!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
A W,Functional,"Really is a great outlet for me for creativity, self care, to-do list reminders. The check ins and affirmations are subtle but it helps my mindfulness practice tremendously. I hope to be able to gift the app to friends although the amazing thing is that people can buy/donate memberships in the app as the developers essentially create scolholarships for folks who may need help with the membership fee (which I think is quite reasonable given the amount I use it)!",system requirement,5,,
Christina R,Functional,"Not only does the Finch app provide a rewarding experience that motivates me to keep checking in every day, it helps me be more aware of my emotions and thoughts while effecting change in my daily life.

I'm more likely to buy an app if it's not forced. The only thing I wish was included in the free version is changing the icons of your tasks. It's such a small thing, but it would help with motivation! Otherwise I love it and if it stays free I'm going to recommend it to my friends and consider buying it (and thats rare for me so it must be a great app!)",New feature,5,,
Megaroo 101,Functional,This app is actually amazing for my ADHD and with my chronic pain. The goals can be as simple or complex and just encourage me to be a bit better every day. It's adorable I love customizing my little bird and I love that the day doesn't reset at midnight. Most apps will reset goals and everything when I'm usually still awake and doing some of them post midnight. Absolutely amazing! My whole family is hooked,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
HannahBear9624,Functional,"I love this app! It helps me to keep on top of daily tasks I usually struggle with finding the motivation for, and you get so much even with the free version.

Kudos to the development team for making such an incredible app!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Jemz Lol,Functional,"It's so cute and fun too play!!!! I highly recommend this for tons of different reasons. Even without premium the basic finch out helps me alot.

GO FINCH! âœŠðŸ˜",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Sarah H (Jofoyo90),Functional,"Edit; I would like to be able to change the bag my finch carries on adventures. That could be something in the shop. Back packs, purses, suitcases. The big red lump doesn't do it for me. It's cute. I like it. I would say, you got the soundscape things. I can definitely hear when it loops so it kind of ruins the ambience. It'd be nicer if I'm listening to this river babbling for 10 minutes where it doesn't like cut out every once in awhile in an obvious loop.",New feature,5,,

No consequences if you don't complete something!! I've loved seeing my bird grow and develop a personality, and this app is a nice part of my daily routine.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Jason L,Functional,"I love the sound effects. This is a really uplifting app. I was gonna contact the developers regarding this, but google fit integration would be useful.

I feel uplifted when I use it",system requirement,5,,
Sierra B,Functional,"I've been using this app for months and it really helped me get back on track with goals. I started a new job and got really busy and wasn't sure how to adjust to not being home all the time. I wasn't getting any chores or self care done at all, it was just work. This gave me the push I needed to get back on track, and made it easy to start! Being able to set small goals like drink water and take a shower and then get rewarded for those goals really helped build myself up to bigger tasks again.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

I've never been able to check-in to a ""goal oriented"" app daily before.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
PuppyCat,Functional,"When I got this app I wasnt expecting much, but after using it for a few weeks, I highly recommend getting this app. You take care of a little bird, by settin goals for yourself like brush your teeth, go outside, etc etc. Theres also exercises for you to do like breathing exercises and such, all of which help you grow your little bird friend and help you! it has no ads, there's premium but it doesn't take away a lot and is cheap anyway.

Robin Riddell (Munfurd),Functional,I love this app so much! Actually helps me keep track of little things I forget and helps me feel accomplished. And the little friends are so cute! I wish there was an option to organize your wardrobe and body paints though haha! And this is just a thing that bothers me but I wish all the in-game currency was round numbers (like by 5s or 10s) instead of getting numbers like 57 etc. Lol I know that's weird but it just makes my brain happy when all the numbers look nice ðŸ˜†,New feature,5,,

There are so many options available in the game as well in terms of items, customizations and exercises. I absolutely adore Finch!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Air Dutemps,Functional,"This is the type of app that you could rate 0 if you were not using it to it's full potential & blame it on the app instead of plain admitting you weren't willing to invest yourself in it. I really appreciate the Finch vibes, way more options that can possibly fit in any1 schedule even in the free version. The charaters & pets are absolutely lovely. I honestly could go on for hours, you have to try it & stick with it no matter what 'til you familiarized w/ Finch & figured a way to profit from it",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Juli Hoffman,Functional,"Such a cute app and an adorable way to plan my day. Yes, I feel a bit sheepish using this app for reminders while I'm at work, but I love the gentle way it tells me about upcoming tasks. This app allows me to digitally add things to my to do list in a non stressful way. I also enjoy the breathing and reflection exercises. This is the first productivity app that I've ever used that doesn't feel like a productivity app. This is a great way to gameify your day while improving your mental health.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Kelsey Hunkins,Functional,"I've never been able to hold myself accountable to anything, but this app has helped ""gameify"" healthy habits.

Red Panda Studios,Functional,"Hi. I left a review on this app a negative review on this app a year ago and I take back what I say. This is the BEST selfcare app I have ever used, you can easily set goals made by yourself, or premade ones, and make routines. and connect actual exercises and different things to that tasks. there are writing prompts, and so many different things to do around the app. I would recommend to everyone, especially if you struggle with routine and mental health like I do.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Nora Goodwin,Functional,It's such a fun way to stay in touch with friends. It's guilt free too! Some apps send you messages that try to make you feel bad about not using them. But this one is just all positivity and grounding. The birds are so sweet and inspire moments of joy throughout my day. SO CUTE!!!,FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Caylin-Lisa Palmer,Functional,"Really helpful for my mental health. I can track my mood every day, and they keep a record of it and how motivated I am for the day.

Alicen Roberts,Functional,"I used this app a while back, and recently started using it again. There have been so many updates and I'm really enjoying using it again! It's much more engaging.

Alexandra Medley,Functional,If I could rate it 100 stars I WOULD. I can be a lazy person just like everyone else.

Elizabeth Getz,Functional,"I've been struggling with self-care lately, and while I still have a long way to go this app has helped immensely. The finches are so cute and interactive, with notifications showing up on your phone where they seem to be checking up on you. You also get to decorate their tree house, dress them up, and go on adventures with them while every day, there's a list of tasks for you to complete that takes care of both of you. I'm doing the free, unpaid one, and it still helps. Try it out!",system requirement,5,,
Katie Moffatt,Functional,"Such a good app for people who struggle with their mental health and self care. Sometimes it's hard to look after yourself, but knowing that completing tasks can help your little pet in the game, makes it easier to do.

There is a plus option which is great if you can afford it, but the game is still good without it! I love this app, it has helped me so much",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Charlie Hanes,Functional,"Adorable, Helpful, Funny, and so Charming. I recommend this app for anyone, especially if you're struggling with slef care habits.

Scotty Venable,Functional,"One of the best self care apps I've had! one recommendation would be to edit the category of a word when reflecting.

Other than that, an amazing experience!",system requirement,5,,

Morgan Botha,Functional,I love everything about this. It's really helping my ADHD brain get dopamine from taking care of myself. I called my Finch Potato and I love them.

Eric Stewart,Functional,"This app is great. It's a neat tool for planning your day and committing to personal goals. So if you just need a straight up day planner, this app works well. If you want a day planner that encourages you and creates a sense of accountability, then this app is fantastic.

Griffin Page,Functional,I've only had this app for a few days but the to do list helps me stay organized and remember to do things like eat and drink and brush my teeth which is very important since I have ADHD and sometimes won't eat or drink for days without realizing.

I started with simple, basic acts of self-care (depression is a good friend of mine), and soon I was adding more and more tasks, increasing my productivity, and building even better habits. I love checking in, and taking care of little Woobly (my Finch), taking care of him and myself, and watching him grow. The app is packed with great features. Thank you Finch Team!!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Rawxane la Vegan,Functional,"The best app I've ever downloaded. I tried different apps for healthcare, mental health and psychological support, but it's the only one who actually helped me for real, motivated me to come and check every single day and being proud of every single thing I'm able to achieve.

I have tried so many methods, but nothing ever worked. I was always left with shame and guilt. With Finch, I don't feel as bad about myself when my goals fail. Instead my cute birb and I are rewarded when completed. I am motivated, but I don't have to worry about killing my birb if I fail. And the birbs are so loving! I love that I can also add my loved ones!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,

Sandy Hager,Functional,Took my temporary subscription trial from my banking account when I accidentally hit the wrong button on the app. It skipped my Google Play app payment subscription: I don't understand how that happened.

Jason Sykes,Functional,I explained a couple things that could make this more easy to use. For one there is no audio explaining the current exercise and ZERO time between completely different exercises so you could go from a standing exercise to one laying on the ground or leaning against the wall and they would just expect you to be ready with no warning.

Vanessa,Functional,No instruction other than trying to see the move as it's performed on the small phone screen. Sometimes the moves change midway through a set and it's hard to catch the change while giving your own workout enough focus. Zero time to move from one position to the next so it's hard not to miss some of the time devoted to each move. So far the exercises seem pretty typical. Nothing special and they aggressively try to upsell. I'm not planning to renew.,FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi! Thanks for your feedback.

It's unreasonable to think every food item tracked can be entered using only ounces. Also, if you make a mistake with water tracking, you cannot adjust it back down.

Jennifer Lapinsky,Functional,"I was excited to try this app, but ended up disappointed. I have food allergies to certain things and there was no option to eliminate anything other than nuts, grains, or dairy. The food tracker doesn't allow you to input by anything other than oz. It also doesn't allow you to input recipes and get the nutrition information. The meal plan was way too much for me. No easy lunch options to take to work.

Robin Arthur,Functional,I paid $39.99 for an app to help and guide through intermittent fasting.What I ended up signing up for was not as useful as I had hoped.

Rachael Peden,Functional,"Good concept, but needs work. I like the hydration reminders, nice workout selection with subscription, but the tracking is severely limited. Food defaults to the same portion for every serving size (3.57oz) with no standards for basic items (like an egg) and you can't go back and add things the next day. Can't adjust fasting start time if you forget. Training suggestions pop up super late at night (like, 9pm) with no alternate timing options. Weekly reports don't include all tracked items.",system requirement,2,"Hello, Rachael! Thank you for reaching out to us. We have found your query and replied to your email.

L Ballard,Functional,"I've had this app for two days, and I'm trying to use it to the full extent to get my money's worth. The part that frustrates me the most is the exercises. As many others have said, there is no transition between exercises, no noise (words or music), and the exercises are so mixed up.

Brittany Lyons,Functional,The app was okay while I was using it but when I went to cancel I found it wouldn't let me. Apparently to confirm cancelation they are meant to send an email.

Sometimes the moves change midway through a set and it's hard to catch the change while giving your own workout enough focus.

(2 week trial period) I am on a journey of self improvement as a 27yo woman. so far I am enjoying the app after a few days. the list format for daily activities is great for me and each task is fairly easy to complete. I'm liking the water and food tracker. I have NEVER counted calories or watched how much I ate but this app makes that easy and fun too since I can scan the barcode of my foods.,FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hello Angelica! Thank you kindly for your review, we greatly appreciate it. But it has three stars:( What can we do to get more stars from you? For more tips, please reach us at gethelp@betterme.world.

Theo Tate,Functional,"It is OK, but even after I paid, I am still hit with multiple advertisements for more money. As for the workouts, there isn't any time for transitioning from one exercise to the next. Also, you can't pause the workout to catch up, so it is near impossible to do the total amount of time for each exercise. For a plus, I do like the variety of exercises.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Ann S,Functional,"Just signed up for 4 weeks. I'm not new to exercise, but fairly new to wall pilates. The transition between exercises is too fast. It's been states multiple times in reviews. I had to pause, get in position then start up. Took a few minutes longer, but I was able to keep up this way. Sure hope this gets some attention! I'll let you know at the end of my 4 weeks if it's worth it!",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hello, Ann! We appreciate these details of your BetterMe experience.

Kat Kat,Functional,"It's a good tracker app, and I enjoy that it has exercises too. The biggest issue is the exercises go from standing to sitting to standing to sitting every other exercise. It's annoying. Sure, you can pause the video to transition,but I'd rather have a few exercises in a row sitting then a few standing. You also cannot change an exercise or opt to skip to a different one. For example, an exercise calls for walking but it's 110F/43C degrees outside and I can't opt to skip to a different exercise.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hello! Thank you for your honest feedback.

amber,Functional,"The exercises seem to be well balanced. However, I don't like that there is no transition time given between exercises, so you always have to have your device in your hand to pause & play. I haven't used the other features yet. 9/7 update - after updating the app, I lost my progress in the wall pilates plan and it won't let me skip ahead to where I was. Very frustrating.",system requirement,3,"Hello. We apologize for such an inconvenience.

Michelle,Functional,"The app is great for general guidance, but there is room for major improvements when it comes to the workouts. If your phone goes to sleep during a walking workout, you have to make sure to keep your screen active if you don't want an extra long walk. There is also zero transition time given during the other exercises. It is very difficult to remove/add a resistance band around your legs with no time provided.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hello, Michelle. Thank you for sharing what causes inconvenience.

Keri W.,Functional,"So far, love the workouts. I actually like the silent videos so I can listen to other stuff. I don't really mind not having a short preview of next exercise or a couple second break. I purchased premium access via subscription. I went down to 3 stars due to lack of transparency about what a subscription includes (in-app and online). I was disappointed that after I paid, it immediately tried to upsell me, and I still can't access everything. Would like access to challenges included in price.",Security Requirements,3,"Hello!

Kimmie Hamilton,Functional,"Honestly, it's only day 1, but I very much dislike how the exercises go immediately from being on the floor to standing and then back again. There's also a bug when trying to pause the app: the timer may continue while the video pauses or the opposite. I broke a little sweat, but I'm typically a heavy sweater, and it's 100+ outside today. Overall, not impressed so far. I'll update my review of I change my mind as the month goes on.",system requirement,3,"Hello Kimmie! Our team has been working on the mentioned concern.

Angela Abrusci,Functional,I just started using it so I don't have a lot to say yet. But I have noticed 3 things so far that would make the app better. 1. Verbal instruction with the exercises would be helpful to avoid having to look at the phone in between sets. 2. The diets should have done way to customize them for multiple dietary restrictions. 3. The dance lessons could use more detailed instructions. These are also hard to follow while watching on a phone. Overall like it so far though.,New feature,3,"Hello!

Nicholas Rojas,Functional,UI can be confusing at time. Nothing really stands out about the app in particular. The most annoying thing though is that it tries to control when exactly you do your workout. It regularly forgets I do a workout only to restrict me from moving on the next day.

Charles Natoli,Functional,"Great exercises for my first day using the app, the only issue is that the transition from exercise to the next exercise happens to quickly and doesn't give me a chance to see what I'm supposed to be doing or time to get into position.

Michele Lesher,Functional,I think it's a good premise to kick start a program but not what I thought it was going to be based on the advertisement. Longer workouts than expected and no direction on how to do stretches correctly from the abs challenger I just did. Reminders about breathing correctly are helpful too.

Leah Wilensky,Functional,"Giving it a three right now (just got it) for similar reasons as other reviewers. It wouldn't be difficult AT ALL for them to maybe show how to do the exercise before jumping right in. Also, maybe a pause between exercises.

One of the 1st exercises I was unable to do so I modified it myself but it would have been nice if there was a modify button you can press for something similar.

Paul JT Waters,Functional,"I hv given 3 stars because the video downloads take 4EVER 1/2 the time when connected, and the updates disallow use of the app until it is completed - no choice to wait till after the session - and without an internet connection there is no way to use the app, you can't download your favorite workout. This is not for people who live in any area other than highly internet connected. Unless they have the connected corporate leash around your neck, you can't use what you bought.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hello, Paul! That's a real pity to know about your experience.

M J,Functional,"Great concept but confusing delivery. I purchased two workout plans. The wall pilates and bubble butt. Wall pilates is great. Has workouts for 28 days and checks off everytime a workout is completed. The bubble butt workout has 85 random excercises so I dont get that feeling of completion, and many are not all related to the lower body at all. Also, when I go to my plan online it shows completely different sessions again. I'm confused to what I'm supposed to be doing.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Andrew Little,Functional,The first days exercises were simple and easy to follow. The process of navigating the downloading of the app was annoying and infuriating. I did not appreciate the ongoing bombardment of additional offers. These served only to undermine the validity of the basic course. I almost gave up. Several times I had to hunt for the 'skip' or 'next' button.,system requirement,3,,

Just be aware you have to go through 3 different instructions to actually get the app canceled.",Security Requirements,3,,
Phil Hulett,Functional,"The fitness program is good but there are WAY too many upsells. One absolutely necessary update is a 5 second video demonstration of each exercise BEFORE the timer starts.

Theo Tate,Functional,"It is OK, but even after I paid, I am still hit with multiple advertisements for more money. As for the workouts, there isn't any time for transitioning from one exercise to the next.

Maddie Bryant,Functional,"The workouts are great and help me feel more connected to my body. The app is only allows you one somatic exercise set per day, which has its pros and cons. It's good for not feeling overwhelmed. However, I like staying up late and doing the somatic exercises before I go to sleep, sometimes around midnight. But then I can't access the next day's workout until past midnight on the next day. It would be great to access the workouts whenever I want.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Vanessa Ratliff,Functional,"Id give a 5 but the bugs. My big issue is it not refreshing the daily exercise from my personal plan. Ive had one workout stuck for two days. I did it the first day and it showed it was been saved but still two days later, its still the same one. Usually id get stuck on the walking exercise but this time it's a regular one. I try to skip through and save it but not sure how to fix now. Other than that, great app with amazing options.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Zlatan Jurinovic,Functional,It's a good app. I wish they would give you alternative food plan options for when you don't have all the ingredients. The videos do start off pretty fast and you can rewind which is kinda stupid. It also doesn't tell you what the next exercise is so you lose a few seconds for each workout cause your trying to figure what what to do. Overall it's okay,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
da.misterfister aka tX3d0b0xXr,Functional,"App has so much potential, but there needs to be more time in between exercises!! Some ideas could be to add a 3, 5 or 10 second timer in between with a preview of what the next workout is (can be an option in the settings for a timer or to just have it paused in general with a clip preview of what the workout is). Having the workout start immediately, especially when we dont know what is next, not only interrupts the flow of our workout but takes up more time!! Im sure yall get these a lot!",New feature,4,,
Shane Riggie,Functional,"Good app with good exercises. Would be nice if there was a 10 second or so pause between workouts to show what the next exercise is and give a chance to set up. When it jumps from standing to laying down or laying on your stomach then switching to back, it takes a moment and by the time you've checked your phone to see what you're doing, you've missed the first 10 seconds of that exercises.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Gwen Maurello,Functional,"Updated: oh this app is so much better with the new update. It now gives directions for each exercise with transition time in between. It did reset my account back to day 1 prior to the update, so hoping that won't happen again. Definitely much easier to use and I really enjoy the simple but great exercises. There's also so many easy options to add on based on what I need. Thank you for listening and making some great changes!",New feature,4,"Update: Gwen, we are so happy to read your update!

Graceful Space,Functional,"I liked the Wall Pilates exercises. The verbal instructions + video were pretty easy to follow, EXCEPT: 1. From the camera angle used, you couldn't tell how close to the wall the model's butt was for each exercise. 2. The verbal instructions didn't always match what the model was doing. 3. During the cool-down the model didn't move at all, so there was no visual demonstration of the verbal instructions. 4. The cool-down only used one side of the body without repeating it for the other side.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Gilbert Perez,Functional,"As the workouts continue, I noticed there is no minor pause for you to switch to the next position. Once that position is done, it automatically changes, and the timer starts. I believe it should change, & wait a couple to a few seconds for the switch pose. There is no pause button if in case you need it.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Ro,Functional,"My original post was 2 stars. I finally spoke with a person about my concerns. The app has drastically improved. There is a review of the steps prior for wall pilates. The band doesn't take you to the coach, but in your plan, you have to message a coach via the black chat bubble on the top right side. I like the challenges titles and stuff but find it hard to pay $10+/ each month for one. I don't buy coffee every day, so it isn't just a budget move thing.",system requirement,4,"Update: Hello!

I just wish the challenges were included, or at least cheaper, since the app itself isn't cheap.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Michelle Fox,Functional,"I'd I could give a 4 1/2 stars I would. There's a lot of great workout options. The wall palates is the reason I got it, and I love it. They seem to be updating/improving the videos to address customer concerns. I've been using around 2+ mths. I've had a handful of peoplebask if I lost weight. I haven't, but I have toned up my middle section, which was my goal.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
swanson20,Functional,"This app is easy to use. Other reviews stated that there was not enough transition time between each exercise, but I found that you can pause the video.

Or maybe include a preview video between each exercise that shows how to do it while we get into position.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Monica S,Functional,"The transitions in the videos are not great, there is no time to reset and they constantly go from standing to sitting to standing to sitting without time to get into position.

There is also an intermittent fasting guide that is good.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Ruth Hansen,Functional,"I've liked the app for the most part. I like all the different things that are included besides just the walk pilates. Two Changes that would be extremely helpful. On the wall pilotes, Having transition time between the different exercises. Even 5 seconds to get your body in position for the next move. Audible instructions naming the next exercise as well as basic how to instructions. Sometimes by the time I figure out what I'm supposed to be doing the timer is half gone.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Debbie Valloni,Functional,"I like the whole concept of this app. I have some of the same issues as well. I do like that now you have changed up the videos with timers to get into position before the next exercise starts and verbal instruction. So Much Better!

Still milling around with the other options but overall I like it.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Jana Soroski,Functional,I'm new but so far pleasantly surprised. I kept seeing the ads on my social media and thought I'd give it a try. The workouts feel great and are customized to my profile survey.

Randi Lu,Functional,"So this is day #2 with the app but my first day using it. So far, I have just done the stretches but it irritated me that the exercises weren't consistently on the ground or standing up. One would have you standing, the next would have you lying down, the next standing, the next lying down, etc etc. And there is no option to rewind that I can see and they don't give you time to get on the ground or stand so I am constantly scurrying to pause to try and get into position. Otherwise, awesome.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Tina Rosenbaum,Functional,I like that it has a certain set of exercises to do without having to figure it for myself. However I wish that it had sound & talked you through on what to do without having to try and look at my phone while trying to quickly get in position and already starting it late and maybe a play button or pause at least so as to have time to get in position for the next exercise.

Drew Moore,Functional,Like the app so far only a few things I would add or change. 1. There should be a grocery list option that easily takes the suggested meal plans and creates the list. Going through every meal and writing down the list is too much work for something that could be achieved easily thru the app. 2. The workout section. This may just be me but I can't seem to find an option to change the suggested workouts from home workouts to gym workouts.,New feature,4,"Hello. We are pleased that you have been enjoying the app!

Susan Moore,Functional,"So far, so good. Only 4 stars because there is no verbal guidance during the exercises. Leads to guesswork. If that changes, or if the feature is easier to find, will gladly rethink to upgrade to the 5 stars. Also: Hard sell on the fitness bands. Only app requiring location to log workputs on google fit.

Tiffany Thomsen,Functional,Nice for accountability though there are some issues. Exercises/workout are just challenging enough and paced well. I find the calorie tracker definately needs improvement. Everything is listed in ounces and I don't measure much of the food I eat that way. I use cups and tablespoons much more frequently.

I'm down 2.7 pounds since I started a few days ago. I'm happy with the app, it's easy to navigate and very simple instructions. I am starting to feel all the weight I've been carrying around with the beginner movements, but it's all about progress. You can do this!

Brittany Jenco,Functional,"The app has some hiccups but the tech team worked to resolve my issue and even gave me a month free subscription. Often I would open it and it would start me back on day 1. To resolve this I would need to close the app down completely and then reopen it. After this, it would open to where I left off. I do think the app is too pricey for what it offers",system requirement,4,"UPD: Hello Brittany, we are happy that the app works fine again!

inna grinko,Functional,"Too early to tell but one thing I was going to mention about wall exsersises. When trying to look at the phone and change position facing the wall 20 seconds, than completely opposite of facing the fall, then back to facing the wall, it's not user friendly. Have you tried putting all exsersises in one direction and then when done do opposite direction, because it's too much changing, rotating 160 degrees for every excersise and also trying to see the exsersise and do it within alloted time.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Hello! Hope you have a great day! Thank you for the constructive review, we appreciate it. We hope BetterMe will be ablative in achieving your personal fitness goals. Kind Regards, Team BetterMe",
Leilani M,Functional,"The app is pretty good, but I don't have time to make most of the recipies and there's no way to find recipies that are faster to make without scrolling through the entire weeks of meal plans. You also can't add a different meal if you chose one different than what is listed for the time slot. I.e. avocado toast instead of oatmeal. I have no idea how much calories are in avocado toast and there are WAY too many options when you enter it manually. (One said 7,000 kcal for one meal!)",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Alexander Rode,Functional,"I believe the app is great BUT when it comes to starting the next exercise. There should be a 3-5 second timer before it actually starts instead of starting immediately and losing 3-5 seconds on the workout because you're still getting into position. If they make that change, the app would be perfect",New feature,4,,
Frank Selby,Functional,This was my first workout today so in on day 1. I have a 4 star because I think there should be a heads up of what the next exercise is coming instead of just jumping right to the next one. Especially for individuals not in shape or beginners having difficulty transitioning from exercise to exercise. That's loosing time in between.. overall I like it though!,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Sandra Roarty,Functional,"First, I prefer other measurements options for food....I can't weigh what I eat. And I hope the food database is constantly added to. That's one thing about MFP....you could find most ANY food on there. But this is a good start for a way to monitor your food as well as behaviors. I took a chance and paid for a year. I look forward to more improvements.",system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"I love the water tracking because unlike other apps it allows you to choose different ounces without changing the settings. The exercise routine is amazing and you can see an illustration that moves real time. I didnt give it 5 stars because the calorie counting feature does not have a database as extensive as other apps, so you may not find some brands. Also, the steps count is based on your phone. I have a smart watch, the app doesnt allow you to edit the steps and not sure I can link them.",system requirement,4,"Hello! Thank you for your review and your suggestion.

Heather,Functional,"I'm a new user, but so far I really like it! There is one thing that I have found that could be adjusted IMO. During the timed exercises, there is little to no pause between the current exercise and the next one. Especially as a new user, I find it difficult to anticipate exactly what position I need to be in, which way I should be facing, standing up/on the floor, etc. I try to pause it quickly when one ends and the next begins, but it's a bit of a hassle on my phone app. Otherwise, it's great",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Hello!

But I do like the other features of food and water tracking. The workouts give step by step visuals. Should be a good program for that. I'm not interested in purchasing the tracker the app promotes, I already have a fitbit.

Kelly Dempsey,Functional,"Generally, I really like this app. However there is some glitchiness. The workout I did today got stuck right before the cool down. It counted down the rest period and then was stuck. Nothing I clicked worked, so I backed out and it didn't save it or show any if the time I spent working out. Which is slightly defeating. Being able to see that checked off, and track your progress is super motivating.",system requirement,4,"Hello, Kelly! Thank you for reaching out to us.

I had an answer about a week later. Regardless, it is helping me in a lot of aspects and the readings, though only 7, are excellent. Counting calories forces me to eat very healthy but I can also indulge when I want to.

A Google user,Functional,"I enjoy the variety of exercises and the meal suggestions. However, there are two reasons that I cannot give it five stars. 1. The workout program is not adaptive. If a workout is consistently marked as very hard, modifications should be offered. Also, there are no suggestions for combining workouts.

They offered me a discount to try again and the last time it finally worked. I'm glad, I do like not having to plan meals and work outs or find them on my own, I like the water and calorie tracker.

Ashley Castle,Functional,This is only my first day but the exercises feel geared towards the level I indicated but there is a lot of up and down without a break in between to switch between.

A Google user,Functional,"I really love this app. I love that they tons of vegetarian options in the menu. The meals are delicous. I have gone outside of my comfort zone to try a few of them, and they have all been great. I love that you can add the items to your grocery list and check off items as you purchase them for each recipe. The app could be imporved if there was a way to save the recipes that you liked, that way you could easily go back to them. I also wish there was a way to see all the recipes in the database because there was one I saw that I can't find after I reinstalled the app. I also like the workouts. I feel like they are great, challenging enough to produce results, but not too challenging where I feel too intimidated to try. I did have an issue with the workouts, where I was unable to view the instructions because it would say I was not connected to the internet. This is why I reinstalled the app and lost some of the recipes I saved previously. This also did not fix the issue. I did reach out for support and they did address my concern, however there was no soultion to fix the issue. This is a really great app, but there is some room for improvement. The recipes alone are a reason for me to enjoy the app, not to mention the workouts. I think once these issues are addressed the app would be perfect.",New feature,4,"Thank you for your kind feedback.

Amanda sparks,Functional,Love it! I feel good not too over worked. I have some back problems and it goes easy for my back. The only thing I would say is to maybe have a few seconds between work outs to figure it out. I waste like 10 sec trying to get it right. Also tje fasting portion would be nice to put it in manually how many hours I've fasted. Other than that I love this app sticking with it.

Kristie Masemer,Functional,"I like it and I'm going to keep doing it because I have goals and made the purchase/commitment for 3 months. However, the workouts could make more sense. They go from a mat being parallel to the wall to being vertical constantly so you make a decision to keep the mat to the benefit of you for the majority of the time which is vertically.

When entering foods eaten to keep track of calories, there isn't much of a database to choose from and the barcode scanner doesn't always recognize the barcodes.

It's weird, I've tried intermittent fasting in the past and the best I'd do, was while asleep. When I set this app to turn on my fasting time, I stick to it and then some, like a challenge.

Also decent food ideas even for the laziest like me, but my grievance is with the workout portion. It's definitely made for someone who has intense goals (even the goal chart shows my ""goal"" is advanced fitness guru in 4 months), wanting me to crunch out some hardcore work.

Julie Guerin,Functional,"I like the reminders telling you to work out, start/stop fasting etc. The light reading they provide isn't too complicated or insightful but it does help keep your mind on track. As someone just starting off, it would be nice if they gave you any sort of guidance during the workouts- they just move from one exercise to the next, and the countdown starts immediately.

Sarah McGrath,Functional,"I started using the Better ME app about a month ago and really feel like it is working for me. This is the first time I have tried intermittent fasting but it has really helped me control my snacking. I have lost 4 pounds just from the structure of only eating during an 8 hour period each day. I've tried the workouts and they could use some work. Each exercise is to be performed for about 20 seconds, but they move from standing to floor without any consistency. They are awkward.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Hello! Thank you for your kind feedback, and for pointing that out regarding the workouts, we will pass on this to our team further on.

Andre Gale,Functional,Great app! A few things i wish would change: - when doing a program providing a bit more time to set up between workouts (like 3-5 seconds) would be great. You never know what the next exercise is. - i had 28 day calisthenics program but i didnt complete it and i was hoping to find it again but was unable to. So making programs easier to search would be great I like the programs as i dont have to think about what im going to do the next day. I just follow what it says.,New feature,4,,
Jane Wynne,Functional,Well done for listening to all the feedback! ðŸ‘,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Robert Webb,Functional,"Great app for the most part! I only wish there was a way to manually adjust some goals such as daily calories, as I was prescribed by a weight loss physican a specific number to aim for, and the app instead calculates it's own. The daily calorie and food logging also needs work, with no way I can find to look back on previous days to review and copy data over, and limited information when searching foods. Improvment of this system would make this a true all in one app. Other than that, amazin",New feature,4,,
Katarina Pupavac,Functional,"The app is ok, but I didn't like that you basically need a wall that is at least 3mx3m empty (no pictures hanging, no forniture nearby, etc). I live in a small flat, so I basically needed to move my paintings and rearrange my chest of drawers to be able to do excercises. Also, there is an excercise where you need to put ur feet on the wall, and stand on your hands- ofc I couldn't do so, and there was no option to mark this particular excercise as difficult (so it was repeating often).",system requirement,4,,
Chris Tiffen,Functional,"Finding the app easy to use and a couple of good updates recently with timing between exercises etc. The one annoying thing is not being able to see what the following day's workout involves, I got caught by surprise yesterday needing a pull-up bar! I don't have one setup",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Chantal Ferreira,Functional,"I'm still very new to this app, but it has some good features. One thing that would be awesome, though, is to be able to substitute certain ingredients in the recipes offered (not everyone can afford salmon, for example). Another thing that would be a great feature, is to have more strength training (meal plans and exercises). This app is better for beginners, but it's also great for if you need to ease back into things after an operation.",New feature,4,,
Andre Mazanek,Functional,Great app with creative and safe exercises for all body parts and situations. I would like to see a feature that previews the next exercise coming up in the series so I don't have to guess and scramble when the timer for the current exercise is up.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Sandra Da Silva-Creasey,Functional,Good app but moves from exercise to exercise too quickly at times. A shame there is no background upbeat music to go with the exercises too I think it is personalised to a point but I seem to so the same easy exercises again and again but perhaps they are staples of the workout.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,

Lola Granola,Functional,"Just got the app and wall pilates 28-day challenge, I'm on day 2 and so far so good. I got the 1-on-1 coaching option but I'm not sure if it was worth it, the coach is never available, only answers once a day, and hasn't really given me anything yet, just asking vague questions. But I'm only one second day, still want to give it a fair go before I get too judgemental.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Adele Mutiba,Functional,"App is great and exervises are awesome, however would be great if I could chromecast the workouts.

BoYtOy 760,Functional,"It has potential and needs work. I like that it's going to help me lose weight. The problem that I have with it is similar to others. There's absolutely no demonstration before the workout begins. Once you finally learn the move, you're halfway through the session. Also, I'm not sure, but I haven't found a way to link it to my big TV. I can only use it on my phone.",system requirement,4,,
Rona S,Functional,"The APP is full of ways to encourage you to keep exercising and becoming better at making good choices. At 60, getting up and down to floor is exercise in itself. I love the feeling of my core strengthening throughout the day. Highly recommend it.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Lisette Garfio,Functional,"I like it so far, the food recipes are easy for me to make, the excercises and advice they give to follow are good. I think this app will work out for me to lose weight. It's all about being consistent and following weight loss goals.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Angela Beckum,Functional,"The first workout was nice & pleasant which I'd expect for it to get harder. Only thing I dislike is that when doing the floor workouts I don't Ike having to get up and down off the floor. Let floor workouts be more consistent together than separate. And stand up be with stand up. That's tiresome within itself, up down, up down. I don't like it.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
D'Andrea Seabrook,Functional,this is a day 1 opinion but doing exercises is a little more challenging for me as a person recovering from a knee injury because they alternate floor and standing exercises instead of grouping them together however it was still doable. I like that the exercises ramp up as you go along and help condition you for future mobility.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,

I enjoy the ability to track my food and water intake and my recommended workout for the day. I am not sure if this will continue after the first 28 days. The diet plan is not included which I didn't realize. Once you answer the questionnaire at the beginning I can't figure out how to update the diet or I would add a food plan. I am plant based but would like to try vegan keto. No luck with customer service.",system requirement,4,,
yvette danganan,Functional,"It's refreshing. I would like there to be a pause or show of next workout move (option).

Other than that, I see myself enjoying this =)",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Kelly Davidson,Functional,"I'm enjoying the program. Suits my condition and not a huge time commitment to start getting back some flexibility, movement and pain relief.

We dont have any wifi connection at the gym. :( OR please have an option to export the videos to a lower resolution so it is accessible even in mobile data.

However, going to the gym is not always convenient and can be the least cost effective way.

Keith G,Functional,"Bought 3 month plan. Weigh 320. Started exercising. Great workout. 16 minutes. Sweating profusely. When going from standing to floor exercises & vice versa would be nice if you had a few seconds in between for transition, especially for us obese folks.

Angel Acosta,Functional,"App constantly displays notifications that are not very helpful. Example, new clinical items, you click on it and it just show a huge list with all your history, the items shown as ""new"" seem to be endless and there's no instruction or clear direction on where you are supposed to look for updates from your doctor. The text in the results from labs gets all jumbled up because the font size vs display space is not calculated correctly which leaves you with charts that are impossible to read.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,Thank you for your feedback and we are deeply sorry for the inconvenience.

Aaron Lathrop,Functional,"Significantly lower rating because the making appointments feature never seems to do anything.

Kathie Seymour,Functional,Can't use fingerprint to log in. Why bother allowing multiple accounts if I can't use the easy log in option.

We see how this will help the user in various ways. Your suggestion is well noted and we hope to implement it accordingly.,
Karen and Tony Galloro,Functional,"Frustrating. I am not able to view my documents. The spinning load wheel just goes on and on. I also don't like the setup at all.

Shirley Smajd,Functional,"Can't look back further than a couple months in results history. After you scroll so far, it constantly refreshes and bounces you back to the beginning, just as you've found what you're looking for. Have you start all over, find it again, app refreshes again and bounces you back to the beginning again. Ridiculous and extremely frustrating.

A Google user,Functional,"The app is easy to use and navigate but needs some minor changes to make it more user friendly. The action center notifications need to be fixed to reflect actual needs and the patient needs to have the ability to delete these items if they don't apply/or are done. I don't like that all medical info is grouped by category and not doctor. All meds,conditions,allergies,ect. are all grouped as one. It should be under each doctor for easy access.

A Google user,Functional,easy to use and navigation is clear. the two stars are the penalty for occasional glitches that bring the whole program down. not a problem unless you depend on it. that's 1.5 stars because it's happened a few inconvenient times. the other .5 is for provider responsiveness. some are better than others.,system requirement,3,"Hi, please share ideas on how we can make the app better.

A Google user,Functional,"It's still a great tool to have. But the new update shows less information than before.

A Google user,Functional,"This app is just okay. I could be so much more though. First, I think your office visits should be listed in date order according to newest on top, so you are viewing the most current. I have to weed out my last visit somewhere in the middle of the list.

I was looking for one appointment in February with my pcp, I believe to check the time and it wasn't listed, luckily you called with a reminder.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,We regret the inconveniences!

Vim T,Functional,"Update: The app its self is ok, some of the information around results is clunky like some users you can not mark all read at once you have to go into each result and it's a lot.

A Google user,Functional,"Not well organized, I think the most disappointing part about it is sometimes new and old items don't get marked properly so you'll open it and you can't tell if an item is new or not. There's no way to organize it at all. You can't change house listed or anything. It seems like it was a very quickly thrown together and barely better than calling the secretary and asking her directly.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,Thank you for using our app and enlightening us with some of these specifications. We are always striving to improve our app and we are working closely with our development team to improve the efficiency of our updates.,
Bethany Duquette,Functional,Needs more options. I really like the idea of the app but its missing stuff. There should be a way to pay bills within the app with your credit card and view all of your bills due. Instead I have to depend on my mailed bills and figure out if I have paid it or not and then it transfers you to the hospital website. I think you would get more payments if it was better utilized for billing.,New feature,3,"Thank you for providing your valuable feedback. The pay bills option is available only if the respective medical organization has enabled that feature, if they have not enabled it, then we cannot pay bills using the app.",
Angie Quinby,Functional,"I have to uninstall and reinstall far too many times in order to have the most recent info. Messages to doctor are hit and miss; sometimes they just disappear.

Ben Owen,Functional,"It works, but I find the appointment and messaging systems to be less than stellar. For the messages, it's not possible to reply to a specific message from your doctor's office directly. Rather, you have to send a general message to your physician and hope the same person reads it. Works, but feels less reliable. As for appointments, it doesn't let you give availability when you request one. It's either first available or 1+ weeks out. A slight tweak to allow for more granularity would be great.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hi.

Tara DiD,Functional,You're faster than menDent mobile. Your messages are good. Your layout isn't horrible for the main page. I'm always confused on should I send feedback to you or the hospital. Cener health shows blood work results much better. If there's something wrong you can see and read you can click on it and see all the past reading maybe steal that.

Wenzel Ablola,Functional,I like how the app can provide a lot of details from your provider and setting up appointments. The only piece I believe it lacks is the ability to reply to your doctor's message. There is no way to reply to the same message.

Jane Doe,Functional,"The health information on my home page does not reflect the correct smoker status for me. However, my exported health record that I sent to my email shows accurately that I am a former smoker. There seems to be an issue with data consistency there. Also, MOST of my ""Active"" conditions have been resolved. This discrepancy is reflected in the app and in my exported health record. There should be an area within the app where you can send an update request directly to your provider.",system requirement,3,"For any medical information that is missing or incorrect in your FollowMyHealth account, please contact your doctor's office to have it corrected.",
Jodi Canale,Functional,"Very user friendly and efficient. Great customer service if you need to call them. However, when I got a new phone and couldn't get back on the email that I had registered this app with, they told me there was NOTHING they could do about it. I either had access to that email or I couldn't use this app again. I had to go through hell to get back that Gmail account just in order to use THIS app again. So, overall... the app itself is great. I love it Just don't lose your email!!",Security Requirements,4,,
Ralph Strahler,Functional,"Overall the app is easy to use and helpful. However, the one major issue I have with it is if I need to print any test results to take to another appointment there is no way to select specific results to print and when you print everything, it prints in a random order despite being in chronological order on the screen. This one feature is very annoying and frustrating, but the rest of the app makes sense with how it works.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"This is a useful app that is well designed. I found it very hard to navigate the first few uses and am also having a hard time getting my particular personal healthcare providers found and connected. I am sure more use will rectify both issues; or an update will eventually make it easier to use and offer customization of colors, fonts, menus, and other options and that will be fun and exciting!",New feature,4,,
Frontrunner,Functional,Update: I figured out finnaly why I could not log in after the most recent update. My original password had a special character at the end (As Requested ~) It was allowed for years. It was not allowed after the update. There is something wrong with the app now. I have used this for several years with no problems. Now everytime I try to log in it says my user/pass is incorrect. Its not incorrect because I can sign in on my computer with no problems. This started after the last update.,Security Requirements,4,,
Steve Jones,Functional,"It takes a while to go through each item individually after an appointment.

Carmen Merriam,Functional,"The app works well, is easy to use and my information has never been hacked. It is helpful to get test results prior to seeing my doctor so I can write down questions. I would like a way to see all results from each lab test in one place, and a way to print them and clear the notifications once I've read them without having to click on each one individually. Some of my information is outdated by years but, I assume, that must be because of the hospital not the app.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"This app makes it easy to to keep track of appointments, medications - everything I used to have to plow through a stack of paper to find. It also facilitates prompt communications with my care givers through email or the directory on the app. Definitely recommend, especially as the developers are on top of glitches and things that could be improved.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,This app is great. Having the ability to view your lab results as they arrive is great. The ability to communicate securely with your caregiver is a winner.

Ã—You can only have information from one provider. Ã—There's no desktop version.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Alfonso Rubio,Functional,"The app can be a tad intimidating but once you figure it out, it's very easy to navigate! I enjoy the notes made.. and the ability to reach out to your care providers.. Another great feature is the push notifications, emails and texts messages.. their is no way to forget or dismiss your schedule appointments.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
scott stuart,Functional,"This app is awesome!! Easy, direct messaging/questions to my doctor or his staff when needed. I'm also able to renew my prescriptions from this app, which has my pharmacy, insurance provider, and meds all in one place. I gave it 4 stars because there's a pop-up message that does not go away. It says, ""Manage your communication preferences,"" and it's so annoying even after I managed what it said to do... but all in all, it's not a bad app.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Serves it's purpose for a mobile app. The only thing is when I am on the lab/test results page and click on a lab for further information and then return to the lab page showing all results, it doesn't stay where I left off on the page. instead it scrolls all the way up to the begining, which is annoying when going through older labs or if you are like me and have a lot of test results.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,I have used this app for years. I love that my main doctors office uses this so everything from there is at my fingertip when I need it. My only issues are that its so super slow. I can watch that circle go round my screen for what seems to be an eternity and if I try to back out... Yeah.. I must close out the app and start over. Also It would be awesome if we could organize it a bit better. Sometimes I hate scrolling through 2 years of results to find what Im looking for. A search? Thanks :),FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"This is handy and convenient. You can't do as many things with the app as with the web version. I haven't fully tested out the 9.14 version yet, but the basics are there.

A Google user,Functional,"I love that there is an app for your health & a way to see your test results. I have such a bad memory so I also like being able to see all the dates of when I was seen. It's very helpful. The only thing I wish was that they had an app where every ER, Urgent Care, Primary Care, Tests, or anything else would all pop up all on 1 app, even if you went to a doctor in a different county or state. I think that would be great! Very convienent.",New feature,4,,
Robert Kuhl,Functional,"Good & bad: very useful for messaging my doctor for appointment requests and prescription renewals. However the portion with documentation such as results is too wildly. I currently have over 850 'results' but there is no way to select all and make all unread, no batch processing so to speak, you have to go through everything one by one. But all in all it's a pretty good app it works well.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"An excellent app that allows you to monitor all your medical test results.

Nissan Nikki,Functional,"Coming from MyChart system originally & then beginning to look at health records on The Follow My Health App.... was quite a transition for me! But i assume it was just a learning curve on my part.

Hopefully the recent update addressed this issue & things go more smoothly now.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
M Ariessohn,Functional,"Great app, but way too slow. I love how I can easily get my medical info (appointments, test results, clinic notes, and more!) all in one place.

A Google user,Functional,"pretty good app, just wish they could make the initial sign up easier, I had to try several times and now I have to sign in and hope its the right account otherwise the information is not there. There is no way I can delete the phantom accounts so I don't sign into them. P.S. the sign in my on my mobile works fine but if I want to compare my test results side by side I do it on seperate screens on my computer. Otherwise the app works great. I can get my refills sent through the app in seconds",system requirement,4,,
M Chad Horner,Functional,It works great!!! My only upgrade would be that you could send images. With Covid19 and a lot of Televisits it would be nice to be able to send images (example showing pitting edema) I understand major issues need to be seen but there are times I thought it could be useful.,New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"The design of the app is meh. Not what I'd call intuitive. Much of the ""health information"" serves no practical purpose. I give it 4 stars for one glorious reason: Online, all-hours, no-fuss prescription refill requests. I don't really care about any other functions! I only wish the app showed an ""in progess"" status of the refill request (currently, it only gives an immediate confirmation message, then nothing). But I still love it. SO much better waiting to call during business hours.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Kellie Reveille,Functional,"This is an excellent app. I'm more informed with my medical information, prescriptions, diagnosis, test results, and all vitals taken each appts.

A Google user,Functional,Fast and easy to use. Very well designed and loaded with info and useful features. Edit: I will add that the thing I don't like is the implementation and I can't fault the makers but my Healthcare Provider has made participation by the individual services (offices/depts) completely optional so if a Dr or a Dept doesn't feel like dealing with it they just have to opt out.

While the features are easy to use & cover many applications for tracking health, the inconsistent food database is frustrating - cannot find what was previously available.

Jubin John,Functional,"Free plan: Fine for tracking calories and basic macros Variety of Indian meals. Good way to start out with weight loss. Smart plan: Pretty useless. Consultation with the ""experts"" didn't help as they're weirdly condescending and uninformed. Doesn't have many micronutrient tracking options (just 4 and no vitramins) even in the paid plan. No options for making custom recipes, paid or otherwise (FitnessPal provides this for free). You can add custom meals for easier logging (only 3 of those in free plan). Not enough to actually spend 2100 for one year (got a discount). EDIT: Was able to get a refund on complaining Fitness coaching: Unresponsive and unwilling to personalize service. Couldn't even get feedback on form on a timely basis (Some claim they generally respond in 2 hours but can take more than 2 days).

Deepu Dillip,Functional,Absolutely horrible app to use. Would have rated less than 1 star had it been an option. They trick you into paying for full year subscription pretending all the while that it's a monthly payment. Even after paying for a full year the features of smart plan claiming unlimited food and workout choices were not unlocked. Tried raising a ticket for refund using my sole email id which was used for registration. It was denied stating the email id is currently in use. What nonsense?

Analise D Mello,Functional,I find the entire coaches calling constantly and trying to correct you very annoying. Yes it takes time to adjust with a diet and workout .. and for the exhorbitant rates they charge .. i think everyone can do it for free instead of banking on the coaches .. i was very turned off by the constant calls and decided to not continue but neither was i refunded as told by the emails with the main staff ...so i just wasted my money..

Subrat Gautam,Functional,"App is good in general, for people who have fixed routine. But if you happen to travel frequently, then don't subscribe to it, as their dieticians are from some lala land, who have no idea how to handle diet during travels. I took a premium service for a year and it was waste. However their follow ups are great. But, if your work doesn't allow you to have fixed routine. Then don't waste your money here.

Amrit Pal,Functional,it seems better. The missing part is that the trial period is only for three days. it should be at least one month as if one is able to use this app continuosly for 21 days only then he will use it forever. second there is no monthly plans for subscription which is pathetic.

Deepti Malvadkar,Functional,The step calorie burnt showing very wrong information. 740 steps showing 919 cal burnt. It cannot be more than 30-40cal burnt for such small movement.

Aman Tomar,Functional,The app works great......I just use it to count my calories and macros and have been using the app for a long time now.

Accuracy I am not sure about the calorie count..... on some apps the calorie burnt on walking is more while here its less.... so I take standard deviation/variance of 100 cals more consumed and 100 less burnt.,FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We can assure you with the values as it is derived from NIN and USDA, however we do regret the inconvenience due to the ads and would love to help.

A Google user,Functional,"while i love healthifyme for this easy to use interface and huge database, there are 2 prime issues i face with this app. firstly if i have not set a weight loss goal, then the daily calorie intake it shows is very high. ideally it should be linked to my BMR and the activities done. however it shows almost 1.5 times of that. secondly the calories of food doesn't match with other apps. it is always lower in this which might lead to a wrong intake as i am undercalculating my calories.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,

Please make it so that it registers all sets/reps separately",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hi Mohit, Thank you for your feedback! We appreciate your support. We're actively working on improving the app, and we'll certainly consider your suggestion to track workout sets/reps separately for a more accurate calorie count. Stay tuned for updates!",
Sushma R Huddar,Functional,The app is good for Strength training. But trust me Strength training kind of induces some anxiety...so i switched to yoga. The app features are pathetic for yoga. One has to switch between YouTube and healthifyme app and wait for the ads on YouTube to get over. This is not a good sign for a peaceful yoga practice. Also one has to chase the nutritionist repeatedly to get information on diet ! Not much comes out of them voluntarily! They copy paste replies from chatgpt !

Aman Tomar,Functional,The app works great......I just use it to count my calories and macros and have been using the app for a long time now. But since the last update the insight section has been glitching. Even after i delete or modify a meal the insight section would remove those foods from its calculations and instead would just just add the new added meals and give the total calories.

Kajal Karn,Functional,"Over all a good app. But there are some flaws in the diet plan. Once you change preferences it still suggest the same cuisines.

Stephen Samuel,Functional,"Excellent app. Pros: 1. great workout plans. 2. great diet plan. 3. Great Studio experience. - It gives a wonderful balance between choosing strength and cardio, or yoga, which many apps may not give. 4. Polite coaching system. Addresses coaching related queries promptly, and up to their ability. Cons: 1. Toll free number does not work for any technical issues. 2. Raising a concern or issue was not also working 3. If you're slightly late for your studio work-outs due to technical issues or just for joining late due to fast-paced tight schedules at work, beyond 5 minutes, you are prevented from entering, and this I personally feel is wrong. This is a serious issue and needs to be rectified. All users who have booked the session have to be allowed to enter the studio work out sessions irrespective of being late or not. 4. Scheduling a call, is a wonderful system to let your coaches know when your will be free to receive their call, however there are times when the coaches call you directly. I never minded it, however there are other users who felt it to be annoying, as they might be in the middle of a class or some important meeting. I guess, all calls must be mutually agreed upon. This system also needs pruning to make the users comfortable. After all, this is a great app, but needs a lot of improvement.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Hey, we are grateful that you took the time out to leave us a detailed feedback, thank you.

A Google user,Functional,"The features are very good and the app is practical no doubt. One suggestion I would like to make, instead of just providing with the information in macros provide the user with the amount of micro nutrients too.

It is a great way to know if you've had sufficient amount of everything like fiber and fat and carbs and proteins. I also love how Indian food is available in the database, which is often updated. But I'm not sure how much to rely upon the value parameters of those food items. A simple example which leads me to judging the correctness of the values is the difference between the nutrition values for 'Subway Salad' and the nutrition values if I enter individual elements of that salad separately. I would have loved it more if there was a separate section to just find out the details about a particular food item instead of having to check it by inserting it in one of my meals.

It is not possible to use other Bluetooth based fitness and nutrition scales with HealthifyMe app. This means that I cannot use this app without buying your scales which I don't want to because I had already have other scales that I purchased long ago. 2. The food log doesn't sync to fitbit. All my other parameters are being tracked by fitbit and I don't want to manually enter twice in both the app,system requirement,4,"Thank you for taking time out to rating and review us.

Notes in tracking meals. - it would be better if we have option to take notes for every meal time. 2.

Punarnava Mehta,Functional,Its a great app. Only flaw that I can't set macros. Not even at premium. So that's disappointing. Which means I can't change to keto of atouphagy.

Also, I am also confused who inputs the calorie of each food and how come calorie requirement for breakfast and lunch is exactly same?",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"What I like about it: 1) Has calorie details for Indian foods. Suggestions: 2) Sync more data with Google Fit - heart rate, exercise details. Or maybe tie up with either Xiaomi or Mi Band Tools app team to sync heart rate data. 3) Include a premium feature that unlocks all the non-human interaction features such as the AI nutrition and the nutrition details (calcium, etc). Not everyone is looking for the personal coach aspect. The calorie counter section is really nice and having an option (paid) which unlocks everything there would be really helpful.",New feature,4,,

lavisha valecha,Functional,"The app is great, but I think you should bring the feature to enter the amount of ingredients present in it so that the calories and nutrients can be more balanced and you should also add for us to customize the size of individual items for example roti.

Sireesha Repaka,Functional,The app is good enough. But I have few more suggestions which helps the users a lot. If there is a bar line for every food item we eat which indicates how healthy it is will make the users aware of it. Eating any food item counts the calorie But what's important here is eating Healthy food. If a person eats pakora then the bar should indicate a low Healthy food rating as it contains more trans fat.

Natia M,Functional,"I have loved this app, and I do pay for the subscription. In recent months, there have been quite a few glitches recording my heart rate and syncing from my watch as well as syncing activities from Google Fit. I contacted Support, and while they provided various suggestions, all of which I tried, the excuse is now the ""third-party apps."" Sorry, I expect more from a paid app, and if you can't deliver what you advertise, then don't charge for it.",system requirement,1,,
Sandra Rodriquez,Functional,"I just downloaded the app 1 hour ago and signed up for the yearly subscription. I tried getting on the app on my phone, and I got the following error: There was an error starting Cardiogram. I closed and re- opened the app numerous times. I read through the reviews and found that most people were having the same problem. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before downloading and signing up for the yearly subscription.",system requirement,1,,
Chris Kueppers,Functional,Stopped logging heart rate. Up until recently the app stopped charting your daily heart rate. Now it just shows it blank where it would previously show it on the daily graph. It shows the data above it like resting HR and such but not on the chart/graph. On my watch in the cardiogram app it shows the heart rate. All permissions are correct. I sent an email about it on the contact us page but just an auto reply was received.,system requirement,1,,
A Google user,Functional,"I paid for the annual subscription during their flash sale in December. The features lasted maybe a month, then disappeared.

If you use this app, never upgrade, you won't get any of the extra features they advertise and no one will help if you have issues.",system requirement,1,,
A Google user,Functional,"Not that useful if you already use a health monitoring app. It takes a while for the data to load, whereas I can see it all automatically on my Fitbit app. Also, it doesn't load all the data from my Fitbit watch & app, like sleep data. And I didn't even try to plug my birthdate in because it wants you to scroll back one month at a time from today!!! Why wouldn't they make an option to just TYPE it in?!

I wasn't able to use the app at all, so I killed it and removed it. Seems like false advertising.",system requirement,1,Hi Keith! You don't need a subscription to use our app - tapping the X in the top right corner should take you to the app proper (the 'Try for Free' button actually refers to trying Cardiogram Premium; I can definitely see how that can be misleading). We hope you'll give Cardiogram another try but understand if you'd rather not. Stay safe! ^Linda,
Jessica Honea,Functional,"Just.... No. Installed it on my watch, installed it on my phone, tried to sync them. The minute you hit decline on the ""give me money now"" page it dumps you back to the sign up page. I even tried to log in thinking maybe it was done. But nope. There is no x to close out of it.

Now that the trial is over and I'm signed up for a full year, the app is even less functional. It will not sync with my fitbit. I can't get up to date information.

Phil Bennison,Functional,At first it looks great but as it can't send data to Google fit and for some reason it doesn't seem to record above 110bpm it's just no use to me.

Even though I set it to measure my HR every 5 minute, usually it measures only a few times a day (or at least it syncs with my OnePlus 7T Pro this many measurements).

A Google user,Functional,"Edit: I'm using a Ticwatch E with Android Wear 2.1. Phone Android version 8.1.0. The issue is still happening. The apps Heart Rate Plus and Heart Trace are both able to auto-monitor and detect heart rates above 140 and below 50. I was excited to find this app finally working (for a long time it wouldn't open on Android 8), but it seems that the heart rate measurements are capped between 50 and 140. Every day my highest heart rate is exactly 140 and my lowest is exactly 50. I know for sure that my heart rate goes higher and lower than that daily (I have a medical condition, and see drops into the 30s and spikes into 180s and above very frequently) and other apps that can do continuous monitoring on my Android Wear watch have no trouble capturing that. So I'm not sure that this app is going to be useful for helping me to monitor my heart rate after all. It's a shame because I do like the way the info is laid out and I was looking forward to finally using it.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,Thanks for your feedback!

Hector Villagran,Functional,"App is rather useless. Been waiting for metrics to show up for a while and nothing actually comes up.

Thomas St. Pierre,Functional,This app seems to work in spurts. It will take measurements reliably for a few days and then skip a few days for no reason I can discern. Most times when I check the app I find it has taken maybe 4 readings all day long.

So frustrating. I'll be riding out the remainder of my subscription and cancelling.,FunctionalCapabilities,1,"Hi Thomas! Apologies for the delay.

Edit to add info requested in the comment: Fossil Sport Smartwatch, latest gen; connected to a Pixel 3 running up-to-date Android 9. I work in tech, and my husband's a sr. UX designer for an app dev company. We were both completely perplexed as to why you couldn't tab through the years in the date pickerâ€”the only way to get back to my birth year was going back through every single month between now and then.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"That's very surprising on Android 9! Does your date picker look like this: https://digibites.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203630479/Screenshot_2016-01-19-15-37-27.png ?
If not, could you find an image that most closely resembles what you are seeing? Our app should be deferring to whatever the default date picker is on your system.",
A Google user,Functional,"The app gives SLIGHTLY more insightful heart rate data than Fitbit does (it calculates resting HR more accurately, I believe), but other than that, theres no point.

A Google user,Functional,The app is pretty limited in functionality and the data visualization is not that great either- the only metrics you can see are step count and heart rate. Sleep tracking has never worked. Definitely wouldn't recommend purchasing the premium membership.,FunctionalCapabilities,2,,

David Redstone,Functional,"Heard about Cardiogram. Downloaded and let it get my Google Fit data (which gets data synced from a Samsung watch). The Cardiogram UI is visually messy, all over the place, and even after reading the help and clicking around, it doesn't appear to show me anything useful!? I joined the deepheart study but nothing changed in the app. So, I dont see anywhere in the app that tells me how healthy I am and if there are any warning signs. So what's the point? Samsung Health already has heart rate zones",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi David, Cardiogram is a heart rate journal that allows you to easily take notes on how you're feeling and track any symptoms you may be exhibiting to help you gain a better understanding of your heart health. We also allow you to tag sections of your heart rate to show you how certain activities affect your heart rate. Hope that helps! ^Linda",
A Google user,Functional,"I have used now since Garmin relationship was announced. So far it has been hit or miss, much more of the latter. Often very large discrepancies between Connect and this app in terms of metrics such as average steps per day. Although my wearable is on 24-7, see large gaps in data on the Cardiogram app, which I don't understand. I know it's an iterative, agile development but feel like it's not even alpha quality. Most importantly, not sure what insights it will provide beyond Connect. Not that I am a fan of the Garmin solutions which I have used since before wearables were introduced, since 2010, and lived through their iterations as well but I am left wondering what the goal of this app to provide something more valuable truly is?",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,

Edward Clark,Functional,"This is a cool app but it has problems. I use it in tandem with my Fitbit tracker. The main problem is that Fitbit's sensors are notoriously inaccurate and consequently Cardiogram uses this bad data to assess your health. Often times when I'm exercising my Fitbit sensors just don't work that well. You have to time the end of your exercise sessions almost impossibly precisely to get a good assessment. Very healthy guy, yet my health score was all over the place simply due to this technical error.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi Edward, thanks for leaving us a review and your feedback.

A Google user,Functional,Initially I was hopeful that this app would be useful but after having it a couple days it stopped giving daily summary information and started giving leaderboard information about noon 7/2/19.

Thanks!",
A Google user,Functional,"I am totally baffled by this app.  It records my heart rate sometimes but not others, with quite random gaps during the day and a complete shut down at night!  I confess I have only had it installed for a day now so I guess it must take a bit of time for it to overcome its shyness and get to know me.  Yes, that must be it - I just need to be patient.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi Howard,

Mason Verkruisen,Functional,"For looking A heart rate it's fine, I prefer the granularity over Samsung Health.

Edward Clark,Functional,"This is a cool app but it has problems. I use it in tandem with my Fitbit tracker. The main problem is that Fitbit's sensors are notoriously inaccurate and consequently Cardiogram uses this bad data to assess your health. Often times when I'm exercising my Fitbit sensors just don't work that well. You have to time the end of your exercise sessions almost impossibly precisely to get a good assessment. Very healthy guy, yet my health score was all over the place simply due to this technical error.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi Edward, thanks for leaving us a review and your feedback.

Tom Jordan (archerman),Functional,I was looking for app that could do an ECG. The name of this app is misleading because the one thing that doesn't do is a cardiogram.

Juan Gabriel Seiglie,Functional,"Cardiogram is a great app, but suddenly removed Cardiogram Care last week without alerting its users. The help pages online still have all the information about Cardiogram Care, but no explanation as to why it was removed.

Gerry N,Functional,"This app is great except for one big flaw. The data it collects on my watch, and the way it presents it in the mobile app are top quality. However, it will not feed heart rate data to Google fit. (other reviews here have mentioned this, and responses suggest this is a google fit limitation, but the ""heart trace 2"" app, and the ""marine commander"" watch face can both feed this info to my Google fit account) Unfortunately, for me, that's a core feature, so I'm out.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Hi G Nellis, I'm sorry you feel that way!

Alan Fidler,Functional,Not reliable. The biggest issue I have with this app is that it displays data on my heart rate when the watch is not even being worn and is sat on a table top being charged up.

Justin Reese,Functional,Not a lot to it for how much it boasts to include. I was even on the premium free trial and thought that didn't have much going for it. No great way to look at your heart rate in the ways you want. Limited to their few views of the data. No insight based on data.

A Google user,Functional,"3rd day update: No simple way to disable the background check. Pretty Annoying have green strobo every 5 minutes while sleeping. 2 days into it.  WEAR OS: Set the interval to 1 minutetime frame on a cheap excellent Ticwatch. I would estimate a 15% battery/hour or 6 hours to drain completely the watch. The default configuration is set to 5 minutes so probably drop to a 3/4% / hour. Configuration is nice but I still have to test the workout mode. Would be lovely have to have a couple of dedicated ""face"" (terrible name). Implementing those is trivial and much needed for real time apps like these. ANDROID OS: Very nice, No Ads, (I assume their business model revolve around the value of the informations they mine ala WAZE). Pretty impressive custom developed Timeline; love the personalized tags; not perfect , the zoom is a bit a pain and you never know the timescale. Would be lovely to be able to pin the Summary for the day always on top  Not sure why the Leaderboards are on the Timeline page. Still building up the metrics.

As for the sleep duration section, I wish we could manually add it, as the app never seems to capture it and there has been no explanation of how sleep duration can be/is taken into account. And please could you guys make the interval heart rate capture option available on the phone app as well, instead of just the smartwatch app, I find that to be the single most incovinient thing about this app.   Aside from that, specifically for me it glitches on the polar M600 if the setting is lower than 5 minute heart rate capture intervals.

Meredith M,Functional,I love this app! I prefer it over my Fitbit app 100% of the time. My favorite thing about it is the ease of adding tags to any heart rate spikes I see on the graph. The insights tab averages all tags of the same description so you can see your trends over the life of the app. I also like the metrics tab. I knew I had high heart rates but it's really interesting to see my hr is higher than 93% compared the all the other app users.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Hi Meredith, thanks for taking to the time to leave us a positive review!

Norm Palma,Functional,"Nightmare. I had read the warnings about the app crashing but figured the chances were slim to none. I was successful for about 3 months when everything froze. NO ONE could help and the help desk started ignoring me then they closed the tickets saying they fixed the issues. Of course, I couldn't get a refund and the CEO's email is disabled.

Robert McLaughlin,Functional,"The app is pretty solid. It wasnt the right program for me. Be aware there is an auto renew subscription. You'll get plenty of alerts via text msg, app notifications, and emails for the app, but only an email notification stating your subscription will be renewed. Noom did not offer a refund. So I'm beat paying $140+ for an app I'm not using. Noom you can do better than that.",Security Requirements,1,"We're so sorry to hear youâ€™ve had a negative experience, Robert.

Linda Dunbrack,Functional,"I tried to cancel my renewal within 2 weeks of them charging my card. I contacted their customer support, and they were not helpful in resolving. Since I was set up for an annual renewal, it was a significant amount of money. The services also have declined since I first signed up. Instead of being assigned a coach, they have social groups. If you are interested in Noom, I recommend buying the book.

Dawn Janssen,Functional,"The color coding system is one of the most useful things about Noom. So when the barcode scanner stopped working, I reached out to their support team about it... and their response to the issue with the scanner was the IT equivalent of asking me if I turned it off and on again. Basically useless. I had considered renewing my membership, but Noom will not get any more of my money until this issue is resolved. The Noom program itself is great. The app is laughable and useless.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,"Oh no, Dawn! We're sorry to hear you're experiencing trouble!

Amy Heser,Functional,"They added a new feature that asks to send you notifications every single time you open the app. Most of the food information either has weird measurements (handfuls, or tablespoon/teaspoons of things that would never be measured that way etc...) also the calories on a lot of the foods are wrong. Everytime you send in a correction report they say they are looking into it but nothing changes.

ClÃ,Functional,I at first thought this was a great app. I tried the free trial. Unfortunately I have a trip to Montana we are moving. I contacted Noom told them that I was moving would like to save my profile and would go premium end August. Wife will be keeping her's. They offered me a discount to stay. Then tried to charge me $182 . More then original price. Now I have no way of contacting them to show them the screenshot. Sad if they wouldn't of lied I would of gotten premium in August.

Ben Saunders,Functional,I first had this app in 2021 and it still cannot sync my workouts and steps without going through several 3rd party apps. Super ghetto considering what they want you to pay for the full version and part of the reason why I let my original subscription run out. Redownloaded a few weeks ago and it's still not fixed.

Matthew Elliott,Functional,"Has lots of bugs in the app. It will randomly decide when it wants to sync with your phone for step tracking. And then also delete random steps already recorded from previous days. You can enter them in manually, but those randomly get deleted also. The noom coins don't work. You are supposed to complete daily tasks to earn one, but it will never record that I completed the daily lessons. When you message the coaches, you seem to get generic or automated responses.

festley gaming,Functional,"I updated my review to one star because of serious, unresolved technical issues with the app and the changes made to the program over the last year. My curriculum stopped progressing. No daily articles/lessons. That's a major part of the program. I was told ""they're working on it. I've been waiting 8 weeks on another issue.

Cameron,Functional,"Terrible experience. The program was ok (though it is just a pricy calorie counter), but felt duped when they immediately charged a large lump sum (several hundred dollars) to prepay for months-long subscription. I was willing to pay, but the upfront charge for many months was not made clear. Despite their claims that they won't, they refunded and offered me a promo code. When I tried to use it, customer service hell, not resolved after a dozen emails back and forth.

Andrew Bjorklund,Functional,"Don't get me wrong, the program itself is great. An excellent long term way to lose weight and keep it off. What I don't like is the app. They recently updated the whole UI and functionality of the app. Ever since the update I have had trouble using the app. Lessons won't load and sometimes can't be completed. Food tracking is slow to load, and more clunky in the previous version. Some useful features seem to be gone as well such as seeing your color breakdown for the day.

A Google user,Functional,"Seems like a great idea but it is not at all user friendly. Steps that should be a simple 1 click, take 10 or more taps to get done what you want.

I had success tracking my exercise and food. It pushed me to go farther on my walks. I thought upgrading to the full program would give it back, but still cannot find it. I cancelled the program and uninstalled the app. I now use two apps to map my exercise and track my diet.",New feature,1,"We completely understand how frustrating it can be to lose a feature that's important to your motivation, Karen, and we'd really love to help.

Todd Parkins,Functional,"App funtionality on Android is not good. You open it and it just ""spins"". No option to log water intake. In a nutrition/diet app? Really? No ability to zoom on weight loss progress graph. Food database is severely lacking and not very accurate even when scanning. Needs a lot of work! Lots of other free apps like Myfitnesspal work a lot better and this program is far from free!

A Google user,Functional,"I think the program itself is probably good but there were just too many problems. I went though the trial twice and I never had a goal specialist follow thru with me enough to make goals. My subscription got cancelled because I used the word cancel in a message to my goal specialist. There were other little pains, too much to list here. It could be awesome if you had the patience, but my weight is a big enough burden and having to work to get the program to work was too much.",system requirement,1,,

Justin,Functional,"The program itself is great, but the android version of the Noom app has fewer features than the version for Apple devices. Tbh, I'm a little let down and wouldn't have spent money on it having known that were the case (I should've done my research... sigh). It would make life so much easier if there were an option to create and save recipes/meals...alas, that feature is only for Apple devices.

I have to force stop it multiple times a day in order to update meals, exercise, and to read the articles. It is using the phone as a pedometer, which would be great since I have it on me all day long, but seems to be very hit or miss as to actually recording any steps. Due to a crash the app recorded 2 exercise events. There is no way to delete the extra one, even though the in app help gives directions on how to do it, and the only thing that support said when I contacted them was that they were working on it.",FunctionalCapabilities,1,"Thank you for reaching out to us and letting us know about this unsatisfactory experience with Noom, Matt.

Also, the ""coach"" doesn't respond. Too expensive for what you get (ie motivational tips). Doesn't link with Samsung health, so no step count uploaded and the cell phone pedometer doesn't work.

Anna Ceguerra,Functional,"Diet Program easy to follow. Visualisation of calorie-density budget as it relates to food for logging is very simple and easy to understand Edit: I've found the app to be buggy. E.g. it doesn't remember your steps at the end of the day, even though it was tracking it during the day. Lost articles I read for the day with no other way to access. Support couldn't help me, they just told me to clear cache and uninstall/reinstall app. Guess what, didn't help",FunctionalCapabilities,1,"Thanks for providing your honest feedback, Anna, it truly helps us improve.

The content of this app is amazing but I've come back to using it in the last few weeks and it's now unusable! Every time I try and log food it crashed. And I do mean every single time.

Dustin Mondou,Functional,"Don't download, they have you answer literally 100 questions first, then say hey pay and we will help you. This is a very dishonest scam to steal your information. If it were not a info steal scam, they would ask you to pay, then fill out the survey. They say 14 day free trial, but it's a lie, they have you add your payment info before you even know what your buying, then hope you don't remember to cancel.

This is very poor for something I've put alot of money (Â£120!) and effort into. The point of Noom is that you follow it religiously every day and that's how you lose the weight and get educated.

Cassandra OOC,Functional,"Honestly didn't get past the trial because the experience was so bad. If you are an average person, it's probably fine. If you have PCOS or any thing that means your requirements differ from average, this is NOT the app for you. The calorie recommendations are treated like one size fits all and way too high for PCOS.

Tony â€œTonyâ€,Functional,"First off the one good point. They have a lot of useful information about how to lose weight. And it's more then ""eat less"" they go into details as to why you might eat too much and strategies to help you eat less. I already knew all the info and noom had nothing useful to add. Without the education part the app is only a food and weight tracking app that constantly asks you to buy more stuff.

Ken Blair,Functional,"The overall Noom concept is effective and reccomended. The Noom app for Android has some technical quirks and bad user interface designs that need to be fixed. For example a delay when choosing a previous meal and the app becoming unresponsive when there is a pending alert but the app is opened regularly. Entering data into the app, which one must do 3 or more times a day, is inefficent and slow.

Katherine DuGarm,Functional,"I'll start by saying the Noom program is good. This rating and review are for the app and not the program. The app doesn't see steps from Google Fit even though they appear to be linked. I would like to go back and review earlier lessons. There is a road map showing the course numbers (Noom 201), but not the lessons. I have to go back week by week to look for a day and those lessons, which is a lot of guessing.

I do the training once every day, I enter food multiple times a day. Move the food entry above the training! This is an Android app, you shouldn't have to scroll to enter numbers.

Tanya Mysko,Functional,"I've never been a big fan of the Noom app. They did make UI recent changes which are nice. Tracking weight and exercise is easy; food is hit or miss. I stopped doing coursework - there's no back to the last page, so you have to start the course over. And a lot of the coursework is typing things in and ""sharing"" it, which is a screen shot.

Abbe Karp,Functional,"So far, I'm enjoying the program. It provides motivation and behavior modification to analyze what, when, and why you eat. I really like the psychology training, articles, and quizzes, but the app itself really needs a lot of work. The food logging is not great.

A Google user,Functional,"I like this app for the psychological aspects. The coach checking in is helpful. I used it for a few months, but it was not worth continuing. It needs a place where you can write down and even keep track of the goals as well as the other thinking and reflection processes.

Kiki,Functional,"The program is working, so far. It's been less than a week and I've already made huge, positive changes. The app really keeps you on track. However...the app itself, as others have mentioned, really needs work. I learned from a friend who has an iPhone that there is a slider option in the food log. I've searched and searched for this in my app and can't find it. I measure all my food out on my kitchen scale in grams, so 85 grams of something is a LOT of scrolling in the app. Why doesn't the Android app have the slider???? Also with measurements...there should ALWAYS be an option for grams, ml's, ounces, etc. For coffee, there's not even an option for ounces. Instead it says how many ""glasses"". Very imprecise. I always check the calorie count against MyFitnessPal because I've seen too many errors. In the recipe section, when they break down the ingredients' calorie count, the screen is smooshed and doesn't allow you to expand to see some of the ingredients. Very frustrating. Seems like they put all their effort into the lessons. They really need to work on making logging food easier and more accurate. I would also like a way to know how much protein (and other basic nutrition) I'm getting.

A Google user,Functional,"There's nothing really special about Noom, and it's definitely not worth a monthly subscription fee. Noom's focus on psychology and building good long-term habits is great, as opposed to simply hammering away on calorie counts. But the basics are often just plain wrong. Many healthy and nutritious foods are scored as ""red"", for example, and calorie budgets can be wildly inaccurate. Your $$ would be much better spent on one or two sessions with a licensed dietician or personal trainer.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,,
Matt Miller,Functional,"I was digging the app for the most part, but the food logging has always been a little lacking. For instance, it doesn't include macros even though it suggested I go on a Low-Carb or Keto diet. As of this week, the app has been garbage.

Kayla Hammond,Functional,I'm so disappointed with the beginning of my free trial. I absolutely love the content of this app (it has so much potential) but the app keeps crashing on my android phone.

Scott Hill,Functional,"Agree with everyone here. The program is great so far and I'll continue to try it, but the app is glitchy and difficult to navigate. It won't show or track my steps. I can't type in my calories for a meal and I have to instead scroll down a long list of numbers (sometimes hundreds or thousands long) until I get to the exact number of calories I want.

I installed on my tablet for easier reading of articles, and it reset my coursework progress to the beginning.

Heather Adams,Functional,"Used to be a great app, but they've stripped most of the features and hidden them behind a pay wall that they claim is a ""free upgrade.""

Karen Beenken,Functional,"I love the Noom program itself. I'm giving the app 2 stars because on tracking portion sizes, there's no room for flexibility. For example, there's no 1/3 cup increments or an ounces option for so many of the logging items. The GPS tracking for exercise (specifically, biking) doesn't track properly or track calories burned.

A Google user,Functional,"Pros of Noom: 1) The program actually works and the concept behind it is solid. I have greatly improved the quality of my eating habits and mindfulness towards how and what I eat. 2) The food tracking has helped quite a bit. 3) The app itself is fairly intuitive and easy to use. Cons of Noom: 1) The tone of the writing is irritatingly positive and cheesy, so much so that I couldn't stand doing the daily lessons passed week nine and haven't done one since. It's a shame, because I probably could have learned more and progressed better if the writing was based in reality more, not the feel-good fluffy world of sunshine and rainbows. 2) The coaches are useless. My personal coach did little but ask my own questions back at me, like a bad therapist. The group coach mostly sends out feel-good fluff, which isn't helpful when you have a couple of bad weeks on a plateau. 3) The group wasn't helpful for me. I couldn't relate to almost anyone in my group, as they were all at least 30+ years older, retired, and in a completely different stage of their lives. It's hard to relate your struggles with getting in exercise when you work a full 40-50 hour week to someone that is retired and has all the time in the world. When I asked to change my group, my personal coach dodged the question for weeks and weeks until I just dropped it. 4) The weight chart looks different in Android, and can't be condensed to fully show the peaks and valleys of your wait loss. 5) The pedometer for Android isn't accurate. I often would get home after a busy day of moving around and it would tell me I only walked 70 steps. 6) It's expensive. There are other apps that allow you to track food that are free. Overall, I am grateful for the insight that Noom has given me, but wish that it was better executed. I am almost done with the program and have still not reached my goal weight, and the program's incessant positivity has made me feel guilty for feeling frustrated when I haven't done well. If the developers improved the writing, made it more realistic and empowering instead of forced positivity, that would have helped my journey a great deal. The coaches need work, mine had no positive impact and in fact had a negative impact overall. I want to stand by the program, because it really does help and work, but the app and execution needs serious work for future iterations.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Cierra, thank you for your honest feedback.

Cynthia J Spurr,Functional,"I liked the old app better. This version doesn't allow me to change or remove an exercise after I log it. The sliding bar for calories or time is clunky.

Levi Eves,Functional,"App is really clunky. Good for foods with barcodes, but isn't the whole point to eat more raw foods or homemade dishes? It's so difficult to enter my own recipes and track what I'm eating, because the app makes it extremely difficult to do so. Even then, they may not appear when you search for them to input them. You may also experience glitches like mine where suddenly all your base recipes get their calories changed if u eat more than 1 serving in a day. For the price, I expected much better.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"Thanks Levi, we appreciate your feedback! It is often sufficient to select an existing database item that is similar to your recipe and the correct color, rather than inputting custom recipes, which can take some time. Your input is invaluable in our journey to enhance user experience and we can be reached at GPSreviews@noom.com.",
Les,Functional,"I'm happy with the program and the motivational aspect of Noom, however, this app is terrible. It's a pain to log food, find recipes, etc. I've used WW in the past and everything went much more smoothly so if you aren't used to that maybe you won't mind. Tons of glitches with the app and freezes constantly. I've had to reinstall several times. Steps don't sink up with Fitbit app even after getting help troubleshooting.",system requirement,2,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Les, and your honest feedback here is appreciated!

Jonathon Krouth,Functional,"My experience with Noom has been suboptimal. I think that the information in the program is good, but unfortunately, there are parts of the app that simply don't work. Automatic step counting isn't working with Noom or Google Fit. Adding steps manually also doesn't work. Also, despite doing the daily activities, I'm not receiving any Noom coins. I've tried reinstalling the app, but that hasn't helped. In short, don't pay in unless you're sure it works for you.",FunctionalCapabilities,2,"We're sorry that you're experiencing these technical issues, Jonathon, as we know how frustrating this can be.

Kristopher Skinner,Functional,"Using the Noom app is tremendously underwhelming. Barely a week into using it on a daily basis, I have multiple frustrations with Food Logging and Move (step) tracking. No matter what settings I try, I cannot get Noom to sync with my pedometer data. I'm using a Note20 and a Samsung Watch. This data syncs just fine in Samsung Health and Google Fit, but there's NOTHING showing in Noom. And no, not a single suggestion from the Noom Support chat has resolved this issue.

Ruzeen Farsad,Functional,"Hasn't helped. Whilst there is psychology lessons (small reading chunks) the VAST majority of this program is meal/calorie logging that you can get on any app. I followed the advice the best I could, I logged meals, ate grapes (so. Many. Grapes), read the psychology etc and it probably helped for 2 months. There's also typo or grammar errors here and there. Whilst innoculous, if I'm paying for a premium service it just makes the product look sloppy.

Brandy Stephens,Functional,I subscribed to noom a little more than 2 years ago and it was great. I had very good success. I gained a few pounds so I decided to try it again.

And it's more then ""eat less"" they go into details as to why you might eat too much and strategies to help you eat less. I already knew all the info and noom had nothing useful to add. Without the education part the app is only a food and weight tracking app that constantly asks you to buy more stuff.

Joey,Functional,"Didn't help at all. Customer service was terrible, and they will attempt to upcharge you throughout with things like their useless ""mental health"" package. Logging foods is essentially all manual because they lack significantly in a food database. It's hard to justify the absurd price for a subpar experience.

Brianna Laboy,Functional,"I tried to use keep up with all lessons but after a long day at work, my brain was mush. The lesson are very 6 i just felt annoyed reading the same thing again and again. I kept trying. I honestly didn't see any progress even staying around the minimum calorie amount. I bought the 8 months option on 6/15 after the 14-day trial but a month in and I can't stand it. I was told I can't get a refund for the remaining months I will no longer be using.

Sarah Norman,Functional,"Though the psychology behind this program is great and probably the most effective, the app itself is incredibly glitchy. I lose data, have lost progress, and have been put on a course more than once. The other downfall is with tracking food. You can't build recipes and then portion them out. If one of the main pillars is about learning to eat more mindfully, the app's design should reflect that. Customer service has been quick, but explanations haven't always been intuitive.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Sarah, and we certainly understand how frustrating it is to run into glitches.

Joseph Chouinard,Functional,"Overall it's good, There's just a couple pain points that I hope get addressed. First, the barcode scanner is really bad at focusing on the barcode, it always seems to auto-focus on the background, which makes it hard to scan foods. Secondly, for me, the app never launches properly when clicking on their step tracking widget, it just shows a white screen with the noom logo. And lastly, the food serving sizes are often wrong given the calories or vise versa. Just need to be careful when entering.",system requirement,3,"Thank you for your feedback, Joseph. We're working on improving the barcode scanner, step tracking widget, and food serving accuracy for a better experience. Remember - you can always reach us at GPSreviews@noom.com if you need anything.",
Josh S,Functional,"A very good program with (so much) room for improvement in the app. Pros: The program actually works if you commit to it. Bite sized information. Cons: The app is broken, glitches changing my location in the program. The default calorie goal it gave me was CRAZY HIGH. Quick fix: calculate your own, and adjust your age up until you get a reasonable calorie goal. Accountability buddies didn't work. It is clear that some features were removed/scaled back, coaches for example... I have a coach?.",system requirement,3,"We appreciate your very thoughtful feedback, Josh!

Jessi,Functional,"The program is good. I have lost weight and I enjoy the lessons and moving through the courses. The app, however, is terrible. For a couple of weeks it was stuck on my course progress and would not let me advance. That was fixed but now it will not load AT ALL, even after uninstalling and reinstalling. The media feature constantly shows up in the background when I never use it. I extended my free trial but when that's done I will not be paying so much money for an app that doesn't work.",system requirement,3,"We're so happy to hear that you're enjoying the lessons and finding success with Noom, Jessi!

Shelly Gordon,Functional,"I was on the program for a year to lose weight and that part was great. I have been officially off for about 4 months but continue to weigh in weekly, exercise, and track calories with the app. I'm happy to say I'm maintaining my goal weight. The app itself has a lot of technical glitches that could be improved. For example, the pedometer is connected to my Fitbit, but it hardly ever transfers my steps correctly and sometimes not at all.

Angela Shaw,Functional,"The program itself is wonderful. I've been doing Noom for just over a year and have lost weight and have become more mindful in my approach to food. The app is horrible! It reset my articles back to the very beginning without warninh. Nothing we have tried so far to fix it has worked. Additionally, the sync with Fitbit is hit or miss on the steps and weight. There was only one time it did a sync with my blood pressure monitor and about half of the foods/meals I saved are missing.",system requirement,3,"We're so sorry to hear you're running into technical issues, Angela!

Renee Booth-Petty,Functional,"It's okay for the most part. But it doesn't track other movements besides exercise and 'custom' is so vague. Choices of food is limited and cannot add proper ingredients or measurements. The step counter does not work regardless of the choice made. Paying for services when the app doesn't work really is subpar. If it doesn't get fixed, I will cancel EVERYTHING and do something else that actually works.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We're so sorry that you're experiencing some trouble, Renee!

Annee Mchughes,Functional,"The concept of Noom is very good as a psychology/health based program. Some of the app isn't intuitive. When logging foods, there isn't always an accurate option to choose from the list, so one has to figure out calories/servings/cups yourself. No option to create recipes. If you make your own recipe often, like stew, beans, etc., you can't save it for future logging. Also needs computer option. I like that it has a step tracker. Needs more exercise options.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We appreciate your feedback as we work to make Noom the best it can be, Annee! Remember, you can always reach us at GPSreviews@noom.com!",
Maria Leonardi,Functional,"Great user experience and was great at getting me going in the beginning. I like the incorporation of the course journey but found it repetitive and also frustrating that it didn't keep track of prior goal text entries. The biggest downfall for me is the lack of integration with other fitness apps (weight and fitness tracking), the incomplete database of accurate food, and the lack of focus on nutrition in the food color coding system. For expense I don't think this can compete with other option",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Maria, we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts!

k k,Functional,"The caloric density, and the daily calorie budget and weigh ins have so far been pretty effective. I've been steadily losing weight. The calorie tracking could definitely use some improvements to make things easier though. The recipes in the meal plan didn't appeal to me so I've been entering what I eat manually, ingredient by ingredient. This is _extremely_ time consuming and tedious. Would be great if you could save regular meals in a personal database so that they can be easily reused.",New feature,3,"Thanks for your review and we appreciate your feedback! Instead of logging custom meals, you can save time by logging similar items that already exist in the database.

Dana Bean,Functional,"I love the motivational CBT program and that noom encourages me to eat more fruits and vegetables. That said, I'm investing so much time tracking my food and I can't even track/see information that I need, like sodium and protein intake. The app itself is clunky and has a dearth of features; ie, once I enter exercise I can't delete it, and there is no ability to copy meals that I eat often.

Jordyn Crum,Functional,"I can't save recipes, and this makes it incredibly difficult and time consuming to document what I'm actually eating. The recommended recipes don't provide a lot of options that sound good to me. It's also frustrating that I don't get credit for the day if I skip breakfast. I also don't like reminders that say ""looks like you missed lunch"" when I just haven't eaten yet. The ""oh noez"" makes me cringe.

Mark,Functional,Overall a good health app! The food color system is handy and helps me make better choices. The lessons are also easy to apply and digest (ha! food puns). However the meal tracking could use some updates imo. I would like to see an option to track more in-depth info like macros and other nutrition info. You also cannot edit workouts after logging them. Having to put my meals in another app to track my macros is a pain.,New feature,3,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Mark, and your honest feedback here is appreciated!

Mandana Mostofi,Functional,"Initially really liked it. But the quality of courses reduced overtime, towards the end, there were just reviews in AI voices, which was disappointing. The logging you can do elsewhere for cheaper. It helped me lose some weight initially, which was very encouraging, but I never hit my goal so my conclusion is that adjusting diet is not enough.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We're glad to hear that you enjoyed Noom, and we're always looking to improve - we're available at GPSreviews@noom.com if you need assistance or have any additional feedback.",
stef f,Functional,"Wanted to learn about nutrition, but they are only focused on ""caloric density"" and not things like macros or sodium. Food logging system was meh, it was easy to search and add items, but logging multiple meals at once was a pain since you had to go in and out of the pop up for each meal. You also had to make sure you restart the app every day because otherwise it wouldn't advance to the next day. The ""lessons"" felt like they were just trying to sell the program to you, had no info on nutrition",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Thank you so much for your feedback and recommendations!

Robert,Functional,"Uses for almost 1 year. Overall great reading material, calorie counting and database severely lacking. I feel one of the big cornerstones of this app besides the psychological part of the reading is being able to count your calories. I constantly run in to numerous foods with wrong calories, missing all together and barcodes that don't scan. Their is an option to report it but at the price you pay it should be better. Free apps have better databases. Fix it. Thanks!",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We're so glad to hear that you enjoyed our approach, Robert, and we appreciate your feedback on the food logging.

I haven't had a new lesson in close to 2 weeks. This is a big part of why I joined this program. I've now lost momentum It's very discouraging ðŸ˜ž.

Rianna Tibbets,Functional,While I like using noom the app is giving me some issues. The main thing is how I turned off all notifications and almost all permissions and the media player still pops up on my phone. It's so freaking annoying. I use my headphones for Spotify almost all day at work and if noom pops up as a media player I can't use my headphones to control anything I have to use my phone.

There are a variety of apps that give you more insight and have better functions like lifesum or cronometer, both have huge benefits at a fraction of the cost.

Amanda Hurley,Functional,"I kept feeling like I was missing features on the app. After reading up on FAQs and reddit, it's clear that the android version has missing components to it.

I have tried reinstalling, but that hasn't changed anything. I'm still in my 2 week trial.

Edward McKenna,Functional,"At first, I was impressed by the app, because it taught me a lot about the psychology of weight loss & diet & I enjoyed listening to the speakers.

Christopher Knauf,Functional,"This is a great app. I like the lessons and calorie tracking mixed with other third party apps. However, two things frustrate my experience. The first thing, slightly annoying, is that I accidentally skip lessons and I'm too dumb to figure out how to scroll back, if we can, without first saving it. The second thing is, of all the barcode scanners I've tried, Noom uses the worst. I sometimes need to flatten the item on a solid surface to get tge scanner to pick up items.

Sometimes it sticks; sometimes it doesn't. Lately, though, added to that problem is that my calorie budget is seemingly randomly jumping all over the place. After many months of its being at 1200 calories/day, now it's up down and all around. 4/22:Helpful and well designed app. Makes doing the program a lot easier.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Oh no, that doesnâ€™t look right!

A Google user,Functional,"The program is a 5 out of 5. I've lost over 40lbs  in 5.5 months The Coaches are great.  The App is great for tracking your calories. I would have rated this a 5, but the pedometer is just broken. I've restarted the app, restarted the phone, updated the app each time there's an update in hopes that it will be fixed, but still won't track steps properly. For me, this has definitely gotten worse with each update.   Fortunately, I have a watch/phone through Samsung health which tracks my exercise, steps, floors, etc.   At different times of the day I am forced to manually sync what's on my watch/phone with what's in the app.   I've read multiple threads on the net over the months with people having the same issue.   Would it stop me from using the app or the program, NO! But step tracking is a large part of the program's mission, so it's something that I would think they would place a high priority on. I'm not sure if they don't run into this issue with their emulators, or there is no way to truly recreate steps in the emulator, but it would be great if they finally could fix it.

Lessons are good, but fast-paced. I would like to use a strategy a few days/week before the next one. I liked that they read the lesson to you early on, but that stopped after a couple weeks. I like the coach & group coaching- very helpful. I am down several pounds after a couple months, which is better than I had been doing.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We're so glad that you're enjoying our program, Rhonda, and we really appreciate your feedback regarding what you'd like to see improved. Keep on Noomin'!

Tam Braddy,Functional,"Took advantage of the free trial and it was incredibly helpful. You are able to track calories and weight, log meals, has a built in pedometer, and my favorite part, help grasp a true understanding of your eating habits. A definite game changer when it comes to weight loss apps/programs. My only peeve is that you don't receive reminders when your trial is about to end so you're likely to be charged for the full program and it was difficult to say the least to reach someone in customer service.",system requirement,3,We are sorry you've had a difficult time reaching our support team. May you reach out to us directly at GPSreviews@noom.com so we can assist you?,
Kat T,Functional,"it's an OK app so far, but a few things annoy me. like it would be great to filter recipes based on low calorie or high green options instead of scrolling and having to see everything. also, when adding food, it's so frustrating to add a food and having to scroll all the way to the amount of calories it is. I'd rather just type in the amount. plus, when you go off track like gain weight, there's nothing to tell you ""like hey what's going on or are you ok""",New feature,3,"We really appreciate your feedback, Kat! We're always looking to improve, and it's only through your feedback that we can do so. We're always available at GPSreviews@noom.com if you'd like to share more!",
Joan Horst,Functional,"When they switched to a symbol for the app itself I could not find it on my phone at first. Then within the app, the symbols are also more muted. I am a visual person so this does not work as well for me. Sometimes there is too much reading and too many quizzes. This is a turn off. I liked the first set where you could hear it audibly read, which worked well with getting ready for work. I also am noticing the app freezing more since the change to muted colors.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"

Joe Sechrist,Functional,"The content is fantastic and I'm getting great results by logging meals and weighing in daily. Unfortunately, loading up previous meals or creating a recipe is a bit of a chore. I'd also like to be able to just type in values instead of scrolling when it comes to adding meals themselves. This especially gets in the way when it's easy to swipe up and cancel out the input menu as you're scrolling to the calorie value for the meal.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Thanks for providing your honest feedback, Joe, it truly helps us improve. Please reach out to us at GPSreviews@noom.com if we can help you with anything!",
Lori Horsman,Functional,"So many typos in articles. Food log is terrible. Many foods not in there. Many that are in there, have the wrong calorie amount. Navigating food log is frustrating. To add more than one meal at a time, you have to go into first meal, then click all the way out and then go back into the second meal. Android users don't have full capabilities but pay the same. For example, you cannot add recipes. I have lost weight and learned a lot. Coach/groups give support and they help keep you accountable.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Lori, our Support Team would love to help! May you reach out to us with your questions or concerns at GPSreviews@noom.com so we can assist you?",
A Google user,Functional,"Navigation could be improved with more liberal use of 'back' arrows, instead of having to start over from home. The food database is filled with duplicates, each with different nutritional data. They're not screening entries, and it's going to get worse if they don't get a handle on this. The pedometer ticks off steps while you're driving! The app should be better, to justify the program's price.",New feature,3,Thanks for sharing your honest feedback!,
A Google user,Functional,"This app/program has been life changing! There are a couple of things I would make more intuitive in the app, but overall it runs smoothly and the app coach is helping change my relationship with food. Edit: As soon as I reviewed this the app crashed! first time though, so not terrible. I also wanted to add that I would like more interaction with my goal specialist. It isn't really one on one help as advertised, but the group is a great and supportive online community.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,So sorry to hear this! Do you mind reaching out to us with your account details at reviewsupport@noom.com so that we can look into this? We would also recommend checking to see if there is an update available for our app.,
Michael Young,Functional,"Love Noom. The app is mediocre. Great for reading the articles, but the food tracking has some limitations. About 20% of the foods that I have entered have the wrong calories. I can circumvent this by calculating the calories. Also, the scanner can be finicky and sometimes return ""Cannot be found"" one time, then finds the ite. the next time. On the plus side, they have a lot more brands than I was expecting. Despite the above the app is functional & helpful. I would highly recommend Noom.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Michael, we truly appreciate you taking the time to leave your honest feedback.

A Google user,Functional,"For the most part I like this app, however it would be much better with a workbook component that can be saved. The app has you fill in goals, but then I immediately forget what they are and have no way to retrieve them. Also I like the scientific research concepts, but sometimes you're introduced to way too much at once and it's easily forgotten. I would rather have a couple of concepts per week than several per day. Also the weight graph needs the ability to zoom out and see larger time period.",New feature,3,Thanks for sharing this with us! We have escalated your requests to our product team for review. Enjoy the program!,
Tracy Walker,Functional,"I love the green/yellow /red categories. Learned almost nothing on the lessons, learned a lot from the color breakdown. Never went past the trial period, as the app did not allow for recording your own recipes - you can enter calorie count, that's it. Not even in the premium version. Big deal breaker for me. Switched to MyFitnessPal which isn't as good at tracking types of food, but allows easy import of recipes.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We're glad to hear you like to color system, Tracy! Please reach out to us at gpsreviews@noom.com so we can help you record your own recipes.",
Polly McCall,Functional,"Program is excellent! But, there are issues with this app. First of all, from a technical capability perspective, it doesn't do a lot of things that other apps do, or they do them in a much less intuitive way. Saving personal recipes, being able to plan ahead (past just today), identifying red, yellow, green foods from the search screen would all be very helpful. On a non-technical note, your illustrations are not very diverse! Nearly all feature pink skin and feminine-coded characters.",system requirement,3,"We really appreciate your feedback regarding the app, Polly, especially regarding the diversity in our illustrations!

Cheetah Runner,Functional,"Really wish this app had better pricing options, you are charged quite a bit for 8 months at a time. I had to contact support because my pricing actually went up $50 from what I signed up for because the month changed. They did fix it, but guaranteed that's what makes people turn away. I like the actual program, I haven't lost weight yet but feel like I'm learning a lot and motivated.",system requirement,3,"Jessica, we apologize for the issues you experienced with Noom. We'd love to make amends and would appreciate you sending a quick summary of what happened to GPSreviews@noom.com. Once received, we will be in touch ASAP to make things right. Thank you!",
Marcia Vannet,Functional,"I like the little lessons. I like the coach. Some aspects of the food logging are great, but the database is terrible. Hardly anything has the calories that the package says. I think the calories are too restrictive, and the goal of 10000 steps is not supported by research. Also, there is clearly more to classifying foods than a simple equation, and they are secretive about that. Finally, it should not take months to add a food to the database.",system requirement,3,"Thanks for providing your honest feedback, Marcia, it truly helps us improve.

Amber Goodspeed,Functional,"I really like the Noom program, but this app is awful. It crashes constantly, and it's so frustrating. I've tried re-installing but almost every day, I open the app to just a blank screen. It only works about half the time. I would also really like to be able to enter food, exercise through a desktop version. I often get notifications about messages, but there's no where to see them in the app. I do think the model is valuable, but the app issues make it difficult for me to recommend.",system requirement,3,"We're so sorry to hear that you've had such a hard time getting everything going, Amber, and we'd love to assist!

A Google user,Functional,"this app is fairly easy to use. However, the step count does work correctly. There we even products that weren't listed and even some were wrong. I think there needs to me an email sent out letting people know the trail was almost over. I even contacted my coach to cancel the subscription and it says that I will not be charged, but still got charged. I don't need the app anymore and would like a refund!!!!!",system requirement,3,So sorry to hear this! Do you mind reaching out to us at reviewsupport@noom.com regarding this? Thanks!,
A Google user,Functional,"I enjoyed this app initially, however the actual app is very large, slow and often crashes. I like the concept and the layout of the app, but the mapping tool for exercise crashed my phone completely and i had to uninstall the app in order for my phone to function again. I have tried a few other weight loss program and I like this one very much, however I think for the long term, I would switch to something free.   I want to download my input from the app, but there is no computer version. You have to have the app installed to input data, update information, or even cancel a subscription. I wish this app was smaller in size, and didn't run so slow. Also, I don't benefit from the group updating portion. That just made me feel behind.   Another issue I had, is that you have to be online to use the app, so if you are out on a multi day hike, you won't be able to track your meals or workouts.",system requirement,3,,
Laura Lawrence,Functional,"The food logging is very frustrating. Editing the product information (company changed recipe) is unavailable. The bar code scanner doesn't seem compatible with my phone (Samsung S20). The scanner has a clear picture at about a foot away, when moved closer to scan, it goes out of focus and stays that way. Also, when you're in a lesson, you can't go back a page. If you want to reread the last page you have to start the lesson over. Yes, it's only a couple of pages, but it's annoying.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Here at Noom, we are working hard to improve and genuinely appreciate this honest feedback, Laura.

Echo Gregg,Functional,"The concept of this app is good. However, it is frustrating when they ask you to spend approx. 10 mins a day on the app and most of the time I'm sifting through their food database trying to get the barcode reader to work or constantly flagging items that are the wrong calorie value. By that time, I'm annoyed and find it a chore to read the articles. It gets a little easier once you've logged a bit bc the app remembers your inputs. I've lost almost 5 lbs in 3 weeks so I'll stick with it for now.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Echo, those are great results so far! We really appreciate your feedback regarding our food logging and we completely understand how frustrating it can be when such an integral part of the program doesn't feel great to use!

Benjamin J Marley,Functional,"So far I've been impressed. It really does give a lot of helpful info and encouragement. Edit: It became clear shortly after my initial review that the goal specialist is really more like a weekly check-in specialist. Also, the prominently featured system pedometer increases your daily step goal whether you want it to (check the box) or not. I don't want to focus on steps so this bug is frustrating for me.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,We're glad that you've enjoyed the program so far but we're sorry you've run into some issues!

I did notice right away that I can't connect my fitbit. Reached out to tech support and they are aware of the issue. I also notice that the scanner doesn't work as good as other apps, so I know it isn't my phone.

E. O.,Functional,"I'm only a few days in, and while I appreciate the content of this program and absolutely see the potential, I do have a couple issues: 1. App doesn't feel very user friendly. It doesn't lay out exercises and meal logging in a very intuitive way, and I feel it's lacking obvious features, like recipe creation or specifying workouts. 2. So many glitches!

Nolan Wheeler,Functional,"The rating is not for the courses and content, it's for the programs and app itself. It's little more than a calorie counter for a rather pricey subscription fee, and not a very good one at that. The one free in the Fitbit app is much better. The barcode scanner is nearly useless and the app doesn't adjust your allowable calories once you've achieved your weight target. The weight graph sucks as well. You can't change the time frame displayed, only scroll left/right. I did meet my goals though!",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We're so happy to hear that you are finding success with the program, Nolan.

Judi D,Functional,"I was really enjoying the Noom experience until my app crashed for a second time, the first time my coach was able to reset my progress. But on May 21, it crashed for the second time. My app is the current version, the tech people say they are working to resolve the issue. My progress on the lessons went from about 302 back to day one, 3.5 months gone. The daily lessons were one of my favorite things about Noom.

Tina B.,Functional,"Let me start by saying I LOVE the Noom program itself. But, the app leaves much to be desired on a lot of levels, particularly for Android users. The food database has been very inaccurate on several occasions. There are features missing for the Android version of the app such as creating custom recipes to log, add-on functionality won't work for me, etc. Additionally, the UI requires you to have to click multiple times to get back to certain screens.

E H (ch33kyskunk),Functional,"The app is surprisingly easy to navigate and use. I do like the daily reminders. However, I can't use the recipes!

Laura Lincks,Functional,"I absolutely loved the coursework and will consider doing it again in the future. But the meal tracking (at least on Android) was the deal breaker for me.

A much better...

It has been extremely helpful to help me change my way of thinking. However the app and some of the program needs work. The pedometer does not track my steps accurately which is frustrating. I also see notifications which i guess are automated from my Coach but don't get to read them because they aren't in the chat.

Jonathan Law,Functional,"The process itself has been helpful. It wasn't anything ""new"" to me but it was good to have one place that was prodding me to be mindful and track things. Thhe app itself is frustrating. I manually close and restart a few times to get it to load. I wish there was a manual input option for calories instead of a scroll wheel (scrolling to the 300s...).

A Google user,Functional,"Like the program, but hate the app! There needs to be a companion desktop site to make logging food and reading the articles easier. Noom claims you just need 10 minutes a day to use this app, but that's not the case when every time you press the the back arrow or key, you're redirected to the home page.

Jamie P,Functional,"I like the app and how easy it is to use. I don't like that so many foods are either the wrong color, or the calories are off. Also the scanner to scan the barcodes needs some work. It rarely ever works, because it hardly ever focuses. Also, if you type in a food (on some foods) you get one color and if you scan the barcode, you get a different color. They need to update the food lists and add more as well.

Jessica L. Anne,Functional,"I like the information and it is effective, but man, I really wish there was a desktop/browser dashboard too. Not being able to access the info when I can sit at my desk and read it is beyond frustrating. Don't get me started on the food tracking - it's generic and I find that I can't track calories accurately, sometimes a couple hundred calories a day because I can't enter in a food that isn't already in the database and have to find something comparable. I get that the focus isn't hyper micro-managing and learning to have a different relationship with food, which is working for me, but the process would be a lot less vague and I feel a lot more effective if some accuracy were lended to the process. It's just weird that these two things, computer access and more accurate food tracking, aren't a priority for Noom.

I have an ""accountability buddy"" who can share her daily food analysis with me but I can't share back with her. It makes the whole app seem kind of chaotic that they're taking features away.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Oh no, Connie! That sounds very frustrating! May you send us an email at GPSreviews@noom.com so that we can help right away?",
Katie Babcock,Functional,"The new update is awful. The app frequently will not load or lags really bad. The fonts are hard to read. I also wish they allowed dark mode. I don't like the white screen and gray font at all. As far as the program, it's a common sense calorie deficit plan. I didn't feel like I gained any special insight about nutrition. I did like that it does focus on habits, so occasionally I find a neat tip or trick to help with habits, but not enough to justify the cost of the app.",New feature,3,"Katie, thank you for sharing your honest feedback here, as it helps us make Noom the best it can be! Our team would like the opportunity to help in any way that we can. May you please reach out to us at GPSreviews@noom.com?",
Ali Hallman,Functional,"Great app with lots of bite-sized information, teaching, motivation, and help. I appreciate the personal coach and discussion group. There are a few weaknesses however that are affecting the experience for me... If you get behind, there's no way to pause the app so you can catch up. Also there's no searchable database for the information presented in the articles, so if you don't bookmark something you will have to search through multiple days with multiple articles with multiple pages.",New feature,3,"We're so happy that you're enjoying your program, and find it helpful and motivating, Ali! Also, we so appreciate the feedback you've provided here! We are always working to be better and your suggestions help us do that!

A Google user,Functional,"I do like many of the aspects of Noom. However, there are several areas that can be better. For example, instead of having to save an entire article, it would be nice if there was a place I could click on to actually see the goals/decisions I personally made. Also, enough with the acronyms. If you are go to use SO many of them, at least insert a link, or at list a definition if I hover on the letters. I really like how Noom presents scientific information and LOVE using the sliding weight ruler.",New feature,3,"Shari, we love to hear your feedback and are working hard to make Noom the best it can be! Remember- You can always reach us at GPSreviews@noom.com.",
SJ the NERD,Functional,"Great advice, but very fast paced. Within the first month of using Noom I lost 11 lbs. The color system makes tracking food easier, the recipes are great, and I think overall I've learned better eating habits. I do feel that the lessons are very fast paced though. There's a lot to take it. You'll learn about a new aspect of health, say mindfulness, and it'll challenge you to be more aware of this, then the next day it's, ""now that you've mastered mindfulness..!"" I haven't though ðŸ¤·â€",New feature,3,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, SJ, and your honest feedback here is appreciated!

Jillian Morgan,Functional,"Just like eveyone else has said, it's a really solid exercise plan. I've been super successful with it, but the app has loads of problems and no way to connect to apps (like MyFitnessPal) that do those features better. My starting calorie budget for each day fluctuates wildly, making it hard to stay on plan, the food database is severely lacking and there's no way to enter recipes. It's a great plan, but the app needs a ton of help.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We're so glad that you've had success, Jillian, and we really appreciate your honesty regarding what you're experiencing. Would you mind reaching out to us at GPSreviews@noom.com so our team can hear more?",
Rosie Cressall,Functional,I really love the group coaching and support group. The articles are really helpful. But I really hate the food logging and calorie info. Anyone can add something to it so there are a lot of inaccuracies. You have to look at the packaging for everything you eat to make sure your calorie count is right which defeats the purpose of having that part of the app.,FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Rosie, we really appreciate your honest feedback as we work to make Noom the best it can be. Our Support Team would love to help you and can be reached at GPSreviews@noom.com.",
Abhaya Keir,Functional,Hey I'm 16 and just wondering if I can actually use this app as I tried setting up an account and noticed that the lowest age you guys offer as an option is 18.,system requirement,3,"Thanks for your interest in Noom, Abhaya! At this time, 18 is the minimum age to participate in the program.",
eidolon 58,Functional,"The program started off really well with great support and guidance to get healthy in a positive way. It helped me which is why it's disheartening to see the changes over the last 8 months. There is no coaching just glorified social media with everyone trying to out do the other. The app has issues for example when they applaud your logging ""streaks"" I've logged every single day for over a year but because of glitches my app says otherwise. Annoying",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Thank you for sharing your honest feedback. It is appreciated! We want Noom to be the best app we can make, and your feedback is invaluable to that process.

Josh S,Functional,"A very good program with (so much) room for improvement in the app. Pros: The program actually works if you commit to it. Bite sized information. Cons: The app is broken, glitches changing my location in the program. The default calorie goal it gave me was CRAZY HIGH. Quick fix: calculate your own, and adjust your age up until you get a reasonable calorie goal. Accountability buddies didn't work. It is clear that some features were removed/scaled back, coaches for example... I have a coach?.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We appreciate your very thoughtful feedback, Josh! Your Noom Guides coaching team can be found in the messaging section of the app in the upper right corner of the home screen. They can also adjust your place in the curriculum upon request. Please don't hesitate to reach us at GPSreviews@noom.com for help!",
Sarah Norman,Functional,"Though the psychology behind this program is great and probably the most effective, the app itself is incredibly glitchy. I lose data, have lost progress, and have been put on a course more than once. The other downfall is with tracking food. You can't build recipes and then portion them out. If one of the main pillars is about learning to eat more mindfully, the app's design should reflect that. Customer service has been quick, but explanations haven't always been intuitive.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Sarah, and we certainly understand how frustrating it is to run into glitches.

Joseph Chouinard,Functional,"Overall it's good, There's just a couple pain points that I hope get addressed. First, the barcode scanner is really bad at focusing on the barcode, it always seems to auto-focus on the background, which makes it hard to scan foods. Secondly, for me, the app never launches properly when clicking on their step tracking widget, it just shows a white screen with the noom logo. And lastly, the food serving sizes are often wrong given the calories or vise versa. Just need to be careful when entering.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Thank you for your feedback, Joseph. We're working on improving the barcode scanner, step tracking widget, and food serving accuracy for a better experience. Remember - you can always reach us at GPSreviews@noom.com if you need anything.",
Maria Vaiaso,Functional,"This program is really good, but after the initial set up you are unable to set new events and weight goals. The app is still telling me about a wedding that happened months ago, despite the fact that I met the goal. It won't let me set a new event for my upcoming vacation. It works great in the short term, but doesn't adapt to evolving needs.",New feature,3,"Thanks for providing your honest feedback, Maria, it truly helps us improve where available. Please reach out to us at GPSreviews@noom.com if we can help you with anything at all!",
Stephanie Lee,Functional,"It has been helpful with the information included with the program (the lessons), but I really wish there was a way to create a recipe to then use for meals for my week.

We appreciate your feedback about the meal prep feature. Remember, you can always reach us at GPSreviews@noom.com if you need anything!",
Evy Susilo,Functional,"Been on Noom for about a month now. Its pretty good program. But the app is another story. They promoted Noom Circles. I tried to access that from the app. I can't. The app kept showing the rotating red diamond icon for a long time that I quit it. My phone broke, got a new one, installed Noom fresh - same thing. Approached the support team, its as if they do not read my emails since I have done the standard solutions, but fire their SOPs answer. That's disappointing.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Evy, and your honest feedback here is appreciated!

Scott,Functional,"It's OK if you eat packaged foods with bar codes, and need handholding and community to manage your own behavior. But if you're just tracking food intake, it's inferior to free apps like MyFitnessPal, esp. if you cook for yourself. You can't add your own recipes, so you type in each ingredient every meal, or choose a proxy from their database, which can be way off. I hate the simplistic system that categorizes foods based ONLY on caloric density: green/yellow/red. But it works for some people.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We're so sorry to hear you haven't had a five star experience, Scott. We would love to make this right and can be reached at GPSreviews@noom.com at any time!

Renee Booth-Petty,Functional,"It's okay for the most part. But it doesn't track other movements besides exercise and 'custom' is so vague. Choices of food is limited and cannot add proper ingredients or measurements. The step counter does not work regardless of the choice made. Paying for services when the app doesn't work really is subpar. If it doesn't get fixed, I will cancel EVERYTHING and do something else that actually works.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We're so sorry that you're experiencing some trouble, Renee!

Asher,Functional,"An ok app. For the price of subscription not quite what I expected. But It helped me stay mindful of what I eat on the other hand, their food tracking is helpful and I like their lessons. One negative I will say is that pedometer refuses to work for me. I already contacted noom support about it. They basically told me they were aware of the issue and to keep the app updated. So one less feature for me to use. Which for the price ... I wish it did work.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Asher, and your honest feedback here is appreciated!

Christina Connolly,Functional,I'm really enjoying the programme and finding it educational and helpful but there are so many issues with the app itself - my Google fit is tracking my steps but Noom won't sync with it at all and won't accept my manual step adjustments. I can't add a profile photo. Lots of little niggly bits that effect the overall UX.,FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Melody Gatto,Functional,"App is pretty glitchy. The bar code scanner only works sometimes. Most of the time it doesn't recognize the food item. The ""database"" hardly has any foods in it (fit bit has much more) even the bar code scanner only brings up items about 10% of the time. Give it a better food data base, and freeze less.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We understand how frustrating that would be and extend our apologies for your experience, Melody.

Amanda Ropek,Functional,"I was thinking about signing up for this app and did start the free trial. However, when I got into the app it was constantly trying to get me to join immediately and offering me a lower price every time I declined. Honestly, just felt kind of gross by the end of it.

It reset my articles back to the very beginning without warninh. Nothing we have tried so far to fix it has worked. Additionally, the sync with Fitbit is hit or miss on the steps and weight. There was only one time it did a sync with my blood pressure monitor and about half of the foods/meals I saved are missing.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"We're so sorry to hear you're running into technical issues, Angela!

Edward McKenna,Functional,"At first, I was impressed by the app, because it taught me a lot about the psychology of weight loss & diet & I enjoyed listening to the speakers. But after about three weeks of using the app, I realized that the audio was AI generated & that ruined the experience for me. I can't justify paying $180 every quarter, because it feels cheap now.

emo,Functional,"So far so good, but during the courses it regularly asks you to review your previous answers/goals/or rewards - but it doesn't show you them and these aren't saved anywhere; plus when they were a few days or weeks ago I can't always remember them or the specific wording! When I asked it was recommended that I should take screenshots and then check these to remind myself, though I think this should really be self contained in the app, in one place - so it better helps to keep you on track.",New feature,3,"It's so disappointing to hear youâ€™ve had a three star experience.

Phil Matthews-Jones,Functional,"While some parts of the app work well the food logging is a mess. The data for existing items is frequently incorrect, with no apparent way to flag it.

Penelope FiberGal,Functional,"Good support system/plan layout, but mediocre app. Food tracking isn't as friendly as WW or MFP. Slightly better than Fitbit. There's no cross device sync, so you're stuck with your phone. No web access either. I don't have my phone all day every day, so it's not a great fit for me.

Dan Fain,Functional,"The program does seem to work, I think I am losing weight by following their instructions over the last 3 months. However, the experience isn't really what I had been hoping for. Noom would be a good fit for someone who isn't very active and feels like they can't control their snacking or don't know why they eat what and when they do. For someone who already lives a fairly healthy lifestyle and exercises intentionally, it's just a fancy wrapper around calorie counting, and it's pretty expensive.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Dan, we are so grateful to be a part of your success, and we appreciate you sharing your honest feedback about your experience.

Raul Guerrero,Functional,"Noom is a great app, with lots of wonderful insight to change the way you think about food and develop a healthier relationship with it. Not to mention tools like the food logging journal which is easy to use. My issue is the inability to adjust one's caloric goal manually. My metabolism is incredibly slow, and the app tells me my caloric intake for each day is significantly higher than it takes for me to stay the same weight, let alone lose it. It's quite frustrating but otherwise, useful.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Thanks for providing your honest feedback, Raul.

Angel White,Functional,Started noom a little less than a month ago. Overall I like the app and it works well for me. It syncs with my fitbit to track my steps and with my scale for my weight. It has a pretty large database of food although I've found some inconsistencies between their information and the actual data on the food label. I like the variety of ways it offers common sense estimates for measuring food. Makes it easy when out.

Marina R.,Functional,"There are definitely some bugs that need to be worked out. Some people say their on-demand coach seems like a person, but mine seems like a bot.

Angela Fulkerson,Functional,I love that Noom uses psychology to help me understand my food choices! I love that I'm loosing weight and still feeling satisfied after I eat. I love that I'm learning to eat healthier. What I don't love is that their app can be super buggy and frustrating. It won't register my steps. Logging food can be super time consuming.

Jennifer Linder,Functional,"The Noom system is easy to understand and follow. I like that they do not send you food. From the start you are shopping and preparing your own meals. The first reason is that prepackaged food is so high in sodium. The second is that although meal plans show you portion sizes, they are unrealistic with how easy it is to switch from packaged food to fresh. Fresh food is always better tasting and for you. Third is price.

Tracking what is eaten along with losing weight, but learning through lessons how to manage weight loss. 2. Interactive game to learn the better calorie dense food (some have surprised me). 3. You are both thrown into everything at one time, instead each day something else is added ie.Tracking steps, calories, exercise & more.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Thank you for sharing your positive experience, Richell!

Lauren Sternhagen,Functional,Update 7.2023 I still use Noom the free version. Step counting much improved and weight graph also improved. The simple act of logging my meals and regular weigh ins have helped me a lot. ### I have been using the app for a little over a year and have made steady progress towards my goals. My recent complaint tho is the weight graph the display. It seems they have removed the units on the Y axis so I can only see initial weight and goal weight explicitly labeled. Not sure why that was done.,system requirement,4,"Thank you for your valuable feedback, Lauren!

Robin Palachuk,Functional,"Loving the program and the results. The app has some issues that can be irritating for me. I like to read long and listen to each lesson/article. There are a few lessons where the text and the spoken word are different, which I find distracting when trying to take in important information. there is no option to rewind a lesson/article or to turn back a page within the lesson/article. If you want to reinforce something in a lesson, you have to go back to the beginning. If you didn't 'bookmark' an article there is no way to review them. It seems to me that having the ability to control and review the content is a key to learning more effectively for some.

Cody S Bakken,Functional,"The Noom program is an excellent concept. The pairing with a personal coach is better than I could have expected. The breakdown in process and micro-steps is truly inspiring. Broadly, it is awesome. But the app has problems itself. The UI is far from intuitive.

Nila Duggan,Functional,"I think noom is great. However, it seems like they don't particularly like to develop their android app (apple has many more features). Also, their calorie tracker has a terrible UI. You shouldn't have to scroll through numbers to select serving sizes. Often all you can pick is 1/2 or a whole cup, which is not realistic. If you want to use calories it starts at the calories for a whole package (let's say 1000), and you have to scroll all the way through to what you want (maybe 100). :(",New feature,4,Hi there Nila!

Lisa Jones,Functional,"I think Noom is a fun and informative way to start a healthy lifestyle/weight loss journey. They make the daily articles fun while going into the 'why' behind their process, food categorization, and the goals they set for you. And the goals are very realistic and achievable in a very 'slow and steady wins the race' kind of way. I docked a star because the calorie portions listed in their database are basically only 10% accurate.

I've lost almost 7 pounds in 4 weeks. Most importantly I feel like what I'm learning and doing is sustainable. Only problem is the app is still kind of glitchy, lots of errors in the food logging and recipe sections, trouble with the pedometer in several ways. But despite all the glitches I'd keep doing it because the program really works!!!",system requirement,4,"Wow! Keep up the awesome work, April!  We are always here to help at GPSreviews@noom.com if you need anything.",
Jennifer S,Functional,"The weight loss program and coaches are great. The app was easy to use for quite a while, but when I started a new phase of the program, it was sometimes very frustrating to deal with. Content sometimes moved around or was hard to open or record completion of specific sections, etc. Sticking with it, but glad it was better at the beginning.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"We're so happy that Noom can be part of your wellness journey, Jennifer!

Erin Ludwick,Functional,"I love this program! It's the first thing that I've found that actually makes sense and seems sustainable. I wish that the app had a few easier features, like an easier way to search for food calories and categories if you're in the grocery store without having to log it as though you are eating that meal. The food search isn't quite as navigable as the MyFitnessPal app to me either. I would also like for the app to have your personal goals highlighted when you open the app each time.",New feature,4,"We're so proud to be different, Erin, and we really appreciate your honest feedback on our food logging! We're always looking to improve, and it's only through your feedback that we can do so; thank you.

Jim Rutkowski,Functional,"The daily lessons help me keep focused on my goal. The personal coaching is helpful as well. Overall, it is definitely working for me. The food/calorie database in the food tracker is very inaccurate most of the time though, so you have to watch that. It is frustrating when you have a serving of something that is listed on the package as say 150 calories but the data base has it listed as 110. You always have the ability to adjust/correct the calories but it can be a little time consuming.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"James, we love your feedback as we work to make Noom the best it can be!

Maggie DorÃ©,Functional,"This is different than any other health & weight loss app/program I've tried. I like it a lot. The app is fairly well organized. The food database is a bit off; I've found several errors, which can be reported but doesn't help in the moment. I wish there was a recipe calculator like some other apps have so I can input my own variation and get an accurate color and number of calories. I like the interaction with real people along with the reading and resources.",New feature,4,"Maggie, we are working hard to make Noom the best it can be and love to hear your feedback!",
A Google user,Functional,"App is great, support is great, plan is great! There are a few things that need improved, though. IPhone users have the ability to input a recipe and the app calculate everything for them. However, it does not allow Android users to input recipes. This is a pain, period. Another thing that I think would be helpful would be to implement a shortcut to the label scanner tool. It would be really handy for scanning quickly at the store instead of navigating to where you log food and checking it there.",New feature,4,Thanks for sharing your honest feedback! We have escalated your feature request to our product team for review.,
Dameon Varlack,Functional,"The content is good, as I've lost close to 20 pounds altogether. My problems are mainly with the app itself. When I adjust the weight loss speed, it doesn't change the calorie budget. Then when I try to make my daily step goal fixed, it still adjusts automatically. Also the pedometer option doesn't work. Final word of caution: you can not count on their nutritional data to be accurate. ALWAYS look at the lable and do the math. If you follow the program and record accurately you will lose weight!",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Dameon, thank you for your review and feedback! We would love to assist you with your questions or concerns. May you reach out to us at GPSreviews@noom.com?",
A Google user,Functional,"Noom is the best weight loss and management program I've used, because it focuses on changing behaviors. I'm at the lowest weight I've seen in a very long time. Highly recommend! 4 stars because the app itself could be more user friendly. I hate the live workout tracker. Also i don't have the ability to bundle ingredients into one food item to save for later.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"We appreciate this feedback, Katrina!

Sapna Anderson,Functional,"User friendly app with nice interface. Good graphics and very interactive. No problems yet. The only thing I would criticize is in the meal-logging section. I might put the 'other units' button in the top right and 'done' on the bottom right. That is usually where the enter button is and I've mistakenly tapped it a few times. Also after finishing the day, we should be able to go back and add something we forgot.",system requirement,4,"Sapna, thank you for sharing your constructive feedback here!

A Google user,Functional,"I think the noom program is great. It is providing a different way to approach eating and it has been resonating with me. I feel so much better about my food choices and how I eat. One side effect; lost 7 pounds so far in the first 2 weeks. The app could use some work. I am an Android user and I find the sync to Google Fit is spotty. It sometimes updates quickly and other times not at all. I would also like a widget to log food and view analysis, the navigation back and forth is annoying.",system requirement,4,Thanks for sharing your honest feedback!,
Beth Zimmerman,Functional,"I'm enjoying the tips & tools. My only disappointment is the Noom Group. It seems that people only use it to post exercise. That gets boring fast. There's very little sharing in a meaningful level. The group leader posts some interesting things. I'm diabetic so the color coding is a little off (cottage cheese is a better choice than oatmeal for me example), but I'm savvy enough to catch that. Otherwise the way the nutrition plan is set up is excellent! I'm learning a lot about food choices.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Thank you for your honest review, Beth! It helps us improve where it matters most. With your feedback, we can continue to grow as a company. You are doing great, keep up the amazing work!",
Karen Ruppel,Functional,"I have Noomed for almost one year and nearly reached my goal. The program is wonderful and walks you through the science of weight loss. It is well-supported with scientific evidence and really gets at the psychological aspects of human behavior. And, it is humorous! The coaches and group are supportive. The only drawback is the app and a lack of orientation at the beginning. The app needs a back button on each page that allows a participant to re-read pages. Otherwise, Noom is a great tool!",system requirement,4,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Karen, and your honest feedback here is appreciated!

Donna Dye,Functional,"Noom works, if you do the work of recording all you eat - eye opener! My weight loss was very slow, but it did work. After about 20 lbs I got stuck & nothing worked. But I stayed with it & now I am seeing some more progress. Some of the later reading articles are pointless & I stopped reading. The earlier ones are very helpful. A word of warning - if you don't cancel at the 6 month point, they will automatically charge you for another 6 months, with no notice or email of any kind.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Donna, and your honest feedback here is appreciated!

Barbra Barnes,Functional,"The Noom program is a subscription program that helps you lose weight with psychology. The program itself is aboslutely worth the money!!! The app leaves a lot to be desired. It's imconvenient to navigate. There could be a lot of shortcuts added to save time and allow more ease of getting around within the app. But, as far as the program goes I love it and am happy with my purchase.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"We are so happy you are loving the app!

A Google user,Functional,"Overall I love it. I find the articles and psych tricksvery helpful and I am losing weight in a way I feel is sustainable. The biggest weakness is the food database. You can't just pull up a list of green and yellow foods for meal planning, for example. You can only log food and there are a lot of foods that aren't in the database, and no information at all about macros. Noom needs to either improve this or support syncing with an app with better food information.",New feature,4,"We're so glad you're enjoying the program!

Beth DeMaio,Functional,"Lots of issues initially but actually going very well now. Losing slowly, but seeing numbers I haven't seen in years. The group support is nice, as is the coaching. I like the food calorie color system as opposed to ww points. This was a 2 month ""trial"" for me but I will continue. I like the short, intelligent and motivational lessons every day, which is what sets this apart from other plans. It works very well with my ever changing schedule",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Beth, we are so happy you're enjoying Noom's approach! Keep up the great work!

Amy Osborn,Functional,"Content is overall very good. Somewhere around week four, the audio versions are no longer narrated by professional readers, but sound like low budget audios by maybe the coaches?? Then the audio versions disappear altogether. That's a bummer because I like to listen as I'm doing other things. One other minor complaint is that the apps that will sync with Noom for the purpose of step tracking are too limited. I'd rather turn off that feature and save my battery, but that's not an option.",system requirement,4,"Thanks for providing your honest feedback, Amy, it truly helps us improve.

Trina Wafle,Functional,"Content is great. I'm learning a lot and the psychology angle has been a big help. The app itself appears to have a few glitches. Biggest one for me is the pedometer. It severely undercounted steps but there is a way to edit the count. It also doesn't appear to stop adding more steps each day to your overall goal setpoint once the goal setpointt is met. Minor issues compared to the overall effectiveness of the program, though. I'm losing weight and regaining strength, my reasons for joining .",system requirement,4,,
Andrew Eldred,Functional,"After using it for 6 weeks I'd say it's a good app. I wish it was more personalized and focused more on what's hardest for me. Android version has fewer features than iOS but I recently figured out how to enter my own recipes which was a relief. The images and examples are skewed towards women. It's difficult to picture myself in some scenarios and most of the images in lessons are of women.

It doesn't sync with my Samsung watch for steps. You can't add recipes and log a serving. The scanning function doesn't work half the time and even when it does, you have to watch and change the units or it will be wrong. You can't page back when reading an article, you have to start over.

Neal Shaffer,Functional,"Overall, this program worked for me and I think it is worth the price, if you're willing to commit. The app has some challenges, it is sometimes buggy & does not play well with poor service/wifi. The program is pretty good. You get out of it what you put into it. The lessons are goofy, but endearing and well informed. The food logging is mostly good, but if you're crafty you can almost always find a way to game noom's color system, finding a way to make a red food yellow, for example.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Neal, and your honest feedback here is appreciated!

Alecia Stafford,Functional,"The app helps with the mental aspect of a lifestyle change. The tracking of food and water intake is great, and the daily weigh-ins help overcome scale fear. But the daily step count is driving me crazy. I'll reach the goal, even go above it, and it will be shown as the goal reached. The next day, when I open the app, my daily step count to hit will be less. When I click back to the previous day, it will show I didn't walk at all.",system requirement,4,"We're excited to hear that you find Noom's tracking features and psychological approach to wellness helpful for your journey, Alecia.

Tracy Ramirez,Functional,"I've been using the app now for about a month with my android phone. Alot of the calorie counts are off when compared to the package labels, but if you hit the other unit's at the bottom right it goes to another page to choose servings and most of the time it's closer, or you can change it to calories and just log the amount. I also sometimes get stuck in a loop where it won't let me out of meal logging and I have to close the app and start over... that's very frustrating...but it works enough..",system requirement,4,"Thanks so much for sharing your experience with the Noom app Tracy.

A Google user,Functional,"The Noom weight loss program is 5 stars, all the way! But the app itself is only 3 stars. It is slow, buggy, and not intuitive. If you have the app on both your computer and your phone, even if you're signed in to both, they do not communicate. Each item you eat must be entered separately, rather than as a group. Foods which are mostly vegetables will register as red if they contain even a little oil, rather than as 100 cal of green and 30 cal of red.

Connor Chacon,Functional,"I've definitely lost weight with this app, and it looks like I might be able to keep it off for good this time, but there's some simple features I'd kinda expect it to have, like a meal planner.

Leila Bridgeman,Functional,"Noom is great! It's helped me learn about healthy eating and build healthy habits. The main reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the android app still doesn't have the ability to save recipes, while the apple version has had that for years. Also, it could use some nice visualizations of your calories, steps, excercise, and distribution of calories over red/green/yellow. I'd love to see those plotted like the weight.",New feature,4,"We're glad that you enjoy what Noom is all about, Leila. Thank you so much for your feedback and recommendations!

Teodora Chitiboi,Functional,"I really like the concept and psihologie, I think it could really make a difference. The app had some bugs in the activity tracking and I've seen some other small issues, but it's continuously improving. What I found a bit disappointing is that the help/troubleshooting was not up to date with the current version of the app and quite useless for these particular problems.

Tom Cargill,Functional,"Overall great. Only negative is the food database. It's kind of all over the place, and while most of it is accurate, since people are able to create their own foods to log, some of the options are wildly innacurate. Some items are different colors depending on which you choose, and some of the nutrition information is off. My second time through with Noom and it does work. But they need to sort their food database out. Has improved greatly since my first try, but there is still some room.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,"Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback about your Noom experience.

Fitt Boi,Functional,"Great app. Being able to scan meals based on barcodes makes adding food easy. Some things to Improve: - I want to be able to ""zoom out"" of my weight loss charts. I think it would be beneficial to see peaks, restarts, accomplishments in one screen. - the daily dashboard has a poor UX. The calorie counter above looks the same as analysis, yet you have to do 3 clicks to get to it. - It recommends steps, but not other exercise.

Lucille DeFrank,Functional,I love the concept of Noon. The quizzes are great to help get inside your head to resolve eating problems. There are some things I'd like to see in the app-- like total nutritional values for the day.

Meg Rae,Functional,I'm really enjoying this program. The full version after the trial is a little spendy but I am getting a lot out of the lessons and group chats. I put 4 stars cause the calorie calculator still need a LOT of work. There is often times where it just doesnt give the right amount between menus (ex: 1 cup = 100 calories on the easy measurements menu and 1 cup = 150 calories on the other for the same item).

Meesh M,Functional,"The program itself is great! It's definitely helping me to look at food differently and change my patterns with food and other health factors Most of the app is ok, but it could be more intuitive. Entering meals isn't super easy - it'd be great to be able to build a recipe, and to be able to enter more than one meal at a time.

Sydney Berg,Functional,"The app design is great and it's very easy to use. It has helped me to understand how much I'm eating and the food tracking is super easy to use, as well as water, weight, and exercise. I am however frustrated at the way foods are labeled, specifically certain ""orange"" foods. The program tends to focus a LOT on calories, and ignores fiber, healthy fats, and protein content.

Jimmy Sparkman,Functional,"The app performs it's function very well, allowing you to log meals and weight, as well as tracking activity.

I do believe it's kept me on track & accountable. If you follow guidelines & suggestions you will lose weight. And it gives you the tools to keep it off. That's what's nice, no special diets, no counting, etc. It doesn't track steps correctly yet. You can override it manually.

However, if you have multiple devices (I have a tablet and two phones) it doesn't share your progress across devices very well. You can go in to the settings and force an update, but it only syncs your time in the app, and food/water logging. It does not keep your progress in the educational courses.

A Google user,Functional,"I think the idea behind this app (working on sustainable healthy habits and using psychology to help you) is brilliant and what I've been looking for. That much gets 5 stars. There is potential for more usability though. Logging meals is tedious. That's not noom's fault, it just is. It would be way easier if I could do it on the computer instead of just my cell phone which is a problem noom could fix. Also I wish it were easier to add my own recipes. Cooking at home is encouraged but it is such a pain to have to enter in all the ingredients that you ate guessing at the right quantities. And another idea that would be great is if you accidentally put something in the wrong meal you could move it instead of deleting it and re-entering it in the right meal.

Ken K,Functional,"So far, so good. The app uses statistical algorhythms to predict your outcomes based on a questionnaire submitted in the beginning. The app also gives you several small, understandable lectures on the psychology of eating. The goal is to change how you think about eating, and help you change lifestyle patterns.

Meg Gonzales,Functional,"The articles have great information that help to change the mind set. They are written so they are easy to read and absorb.

ED Deadmeato (Ensign Deadmeat),Functional,"Noom is a fantastic weight loss/control service. The purpose of the plan is to teach you the psychology of eating and how to be able to maintain healthy eating after you've left the program. I lost 35 pounds in 3 months. However, the app is missing a few things such as the ability to save your own recipes and a virulent food search like Myfitness has. However overall it has been a fantastic experience.",New feature,4,These are awesome results and we're so glad that you learned how to maintain your success through your Noom program! We also really appreciate the feedback you've offered here and our Support Team is always available to listen to your thoughts so feel free to reach them at GPSreviews@noom.com at any time!,
Melody Bethards,Functional,"Love the lessons. I have learned a lot about myself and why I eat the way I do. The meal tracker and step tracker don't work well for me. I don't keep my phone with me all the time, and app does not connect to my brand of smart watch. There several options for the same foods on the meal tracker and each option lists different calories for the same foods. It would be nice if the meal analysis would add up the number of calories for yellow and orange foods like it does for green ones.",system requirement,4,"We're glad to hear that you're enjoying the daily lessons, Melody, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your experience!

Keep up the great work!",
Jennifer Case,Functional,"This app is really helping me loose weight. In 2 months I've dropped almost 10lbs. Changing the way you think of food, changing habits etc... Really does work. However, I have discovered several discrepancies. Mistakes in their color coding system that makes me doubt the overall accuracy. The coaching is bare minimum. Not worth the total price....but if you opt to cancel before the trial period, they will offer it to you at a huge discount.",system requirement,4,"We are so happy to hear that you are finding success with Noom, Jennifer, and we thank you so much for the feedback regarding the app. We truly appreciate it!",
Shari Lundberg,Functional,"I'm onflicted about scoring this. The weight loss program is great. I find the articles and the opportunity to share experiences with others really helpful and effective. On the other hand the app is a mess. I often have to force stop the app to get the home page to load. Today my step goal suddenly went from 6300 to 0 with no explanation. They have no effective method of communicating tech issues. I'm putting up with the app failures, and just focusing on the content.",system requirement,4,"We're so glad to hear that you're loving the program, Shari, and we really appreciate your feedback on the technical issues that you're experiencing.

A Google user,Functional,"I've really enjoyed my experience with Noom! It's the first time I feel I might actually stick with the healthy changes (I've tried about every diet out there). This isn't a diet. I love that they use psychology backed up by scientific research and I'm learning a lot. I'm down 13 pounds in 4 weeks (I have a lot to lose and was eating pretty terribly before!), but more importantly I feel empowered to actually change habits for good. Took off a star because the food database needs some polishing.",New feature,4,Thanks for letting us be a part of your weight loss journey!,
Kristen Williamson,Functional,"I really like this app and program. It is motivational and helpful to me as I strive to reach my goals. I can keep track of all areas from diet, exercise, water intake, weight, daily mood, etc. Learning the psychology behind food relationship is beneficial too and different from other weight loss apps that I've tried. The only negative I have found is that sometimes my barcode scanner won't scan even when I can see the full barcode clearly in the scanner window. Overall, I recommend this app!",system requirement,4,"Wow! That was wonderful to read, Kristen! We're so happy to see you achieve your goals. Thank you for being part of the Noomily!

Ashley Schlee,Functional,"While I love this app, and always have, I've found that I can't create meals and track that way. I don't have time to sit and track each individual item in a meal and then guess how much I ate. While there are lots of food options, I just find it silly for a program that is so set on making meals at home to not have a create food option (for Android users). All this to say, it's a great app, that has great options and wonderful support. Just need a few more options!",New feature,4,"Ashley, we are happy to hear that you're loving the program! Thank you for your feedback about the food logging feature. Our support team is always available to help at GPSreviews@noom.com!

",
Leanne Jaeger,Functional,"The program is helpful. Some improvements are needed for the sight. For instance, the recipe section would be better if it had search capabilities such as fish recipes, chicken, pasta and so on. As it is now you just have to scroll through. The only classifications are Breakfast, Lunch etc. I have also found some discrepancies between food label calories and those in Booms system.",New feature,4,"Thank you so much for sharing your experience with Noom, Leanne. We are happy to hear you found Noom helpful! Our Support Team would love to help with the recipe section and food labels. May you reach out to us at GPSreviews@noom.com, we're happy to help.",
Abigail Santor,Functional,"Mostly great, I paid for the Noom program so I'm not sure what (if) any free features look like. My one major complaint is adding a home cooked recipe is pretty difficult and there's no ""good"" method for it. There are work around, but they're pretty complicated and can be time consuming. Another great thing would be a shopping feature where you can pull up the scanner when you're in the grocery store, right now you have to get in as if you're logging a meal, not too big a hassle, but still.",New feature,4,"Thank you for your feedback and suggestions, Abigail!

-,Functional,"The content and writing style are great, but the group facilitation and the app itself definitely have room for improvement. Articles can be saved but not searched by keyword or time period, and the responses you provide in some of the more interactive articles are not saved, including the major goals you set at the beginning of the program. I learned (a little late unfortunately) to take screenshots of anything like that if I wanted to be able to review it later.

Lizzie Jones,Functional,"Noom is a great program so far. I am getting results as far as weight loss and taking better care of myself. It helps put what you consume into perspective. The one disappointment I've found with the app is that the Android version doesn't seem to get the same attention as Apple. There's no zoom for the graph and the pedometer doesn't work, nor can you enter your own numbers. Thankfully I have a Fitbit to keep track.",system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"I would actually give it 5 stars, if the pedometer wasn't so sensitive. It adds steps when I am in the car, so I have to try and remember to pause it. Otherwise a very good app. Has helped me eat better, move more and therefore lose weight",system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,I love Noom! Having live people to talk in a community to encourage live situations is great. Meeting my step goal through your phone when your not even thinking it matters is great.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Many food items I go to log are not in the program, even when I go to scan the items by barcode they still do not turn up and I bought pro... shouldn't I be able to log EVERYTHING!?!",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Great app to help me keep track of weight, exercises and so on, however, one annoying bug was never fixed all this while.  I am referring to the ""enable music integration"", the music still plays even tho I have set it to off.  So I have to manually turn it off every time I start my workout.  Can look into it, thanks.",system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"I just wish it would store the information youve read so you can go back and read it again. I also wish that if you missed a day, the challenges or articles would cycle back through so you could read them instead of losing out on the info.",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,I would like to be able to scan or search for food items with out logging meals. Inconvenient to have to log it and then delete. So far I am happy with this app. Very easy to use.,New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Pretty good - a few small bugs occasionally when trying to mark tasks off for the day, and I wish I could review/edit my exercise log, but otherwise, really fantastic tool for not just weight loss, but overall health!",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Easy to use, helpful tips based on research, and I like the notifications. I can't figure out how to set/correct my age. I would also like to adjust my own caloric recommendation, as I need to add about 500 a day for breastfeeding.",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Helps keep you on track most definitely. Good app. Only problem I have is one food may be logged in the food database more than once, and will be labeled under a red, yellow, and green food. A bit confusing. But for the most part this is a great app.",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,Much better like how it is easier to be more accurate with portions. Other zoos have more food/calorie data like stuff from pret or tesco but noom has food colour options based on healthy it is which is helpful for those who have fooled by advertising like me.,FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Follow prompts an plan. Concise information, low international support food database, but can customize food. best if used with a buddy, or to score a challenge.",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,As this is an American  app it does not have every food item listed but you can log items manually and suggest them to be added to the app very easily.,New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"It uses lots of network data to open articles, and most of the time it refuses to do so,  saying I should connect to the Internet, even though I'm connected to a 3G network. Either wi-fi or no reading!",Security Requirements,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Think this is great, I enjoy using it as it is really easy convenient although it does have slow moments every now and then, and I can't retrieve former tasks that have been set for me. Other than that its great. Would actually rate it 4.5",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
A Google user,Functional,I like that it has a pedometer and isn't very strict on calorie counting. Great for intuitive eaters.  I have been using myfitnesspal and today learned that I can connect runtastic pedometer app with that app so I am letting this one go. I still highly recommend it. :),New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Noon could be great if it could just sync between multiple devices - I use my Nexus 7 and phone interchangeably on things like this and it'd be really handy to record workouts on my phone but use the food tracking, groups, forums, etc. on the tablet.  Otherwise, I like it.",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"Installed Noom on my Galaxy Tab 7 & love it. Easy way to become aware what I am eating & it's value.  Easy to make better choices. Love the pedometer feature.

A Google user,Functional,Unable to open app now. When I turn my phone on there's a message saying the has stopped. Fail! Was happy with app even went pro. Update: I can now use the app but lost all my saved info. Happy to be able to use it...,system requirement,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"I use only the free version of Noom, mostly to log my meals. Overall I really like the app! However, there is one thing I find really annoying: I use the ""precise input"" of usually either ""g"", ""mL"" or ""calories"" very often. For instance: With a lot foods and beverages I rather rely on the actual calories on the nutrition label than on the calories in the Noom database and then calculate the precise calories by myself. Also when cooking or preparing food I usually use a kitchen scale and measure the ingredients I use. The input with this ""spinning wheel"" is quite often pretty annoying, like when you have to scroll this ""wheel"" from 10 to 250 or all the way back. I would love to have the option to enable a numerical input (keyboard) alternatively. Couldn't it just be an option in the preferences to enable something like that. I get it that you want to keep it ""simple"" for most users, however, I don't see what could be simpler than input a value directly rather than spinning a virtual wheel. 4 stars - would be 5 otherwise",New feature,4,,
A Google user,Functional,"I can see how the users have lost over 9m kg. There are a few problems though. For some foods, the easy units and the precise units give different calorie counts (1cup for both). Other than that, it's great. Edit: Can I opt not to have the pedometer start automatically? It's quite annoying and drains the battery",FunctionalCapabilities,4,,
Debbie Kirby,Functional,"The concept is amazing. The app is often not wrkg which makes the program inconsistent and stressful. Perhaps in their lessons they should have a lesson about managing stress when the app is down, prob very applicable to everyone lol. I'm getting to the point where I'm going to cancel if they can't fix the app. That's sad because the program works and the app helps with accountability, tracking and keeping a person focused on the overall goals.

We want Noom to be the best app we can make, and your feedback is invaluable to that process.",
Abigail Rockett,Functional,"I am a nurse practitioner. I hate it, but it works. Noom puts the foods you choose to eat into three categories. It does make me mindful of my food choices. I also hate the psychological lessons, but they work too. I can't log certain activities like beach walking, but in the long run it really doesn't matter. It is a great program that is refreshingly not incentivised by pre made foods and supplements.",New feature,5,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Abigail! It's great to hear that Noom helps you stay mindful of your food choices and isn't tied to pre-made foods or supplements. Keep up the good work!",
Carissa Jackson,Functional,"I have only been using the program for 5 days, but I do love how interactive it is. I truly appreciate the listen button! The app does have me excited about the journey, not just reaching my goal weight. I do wish Samsung Health could be a choice for syncing activity. More recently I've had a hard time with adding my meals as the app keeps saying ""more items will be available after the database finish downloading"". I had to restart my phone to fix it. Otherwise everything else is great.",system requirement,5,"Thank you again for taking the time to give us your feedback about your Noom experience, Carissa, and we apologize for the troubles you have experienced with Noom and the food logging.

Laurie Preston,Functional,"I am really impressed with the Noom app and weight loss plan. Everything is all in one place: encouragement, support, tips and research-based ""tricks"" to help you develop more healthful eating habits. It includes a place to log you daily food intake, and provides a personalized nutritional analysis. No food is ""bad"", just stay within your calorie budget. I feel better, and I see steady progress toward my goal.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,This is what we love to hear Laurie! Thanks for being a part of our Noomily!,
Deborah Long,Functional,"I like how the foods are broken out into Green, Yellow and Orange. Nothing is bad or off limits. Seeing the analysis of how you're eating really helps you make better choices. The articles are quick and easy to read; they inject little bits of humor and aren't full of scientific jargon and acronyms that make your eyes glaze over. Coaches reply to your messages. Large database of foods for tracking. Bar code scanner needs some improving. Sometimes brings up wrong food or can't scan at all.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"This is amazing to read, Deborah! You are doing such a wonderful job embracing each aspect of the program! Keep up the awesome work!",
Leslie Lane,Functional,"I love learning the ins & outs of choosing healthier meals. And the psychology to back it up & give me support & suggestions when I am tempted to eat something that may be delicious but is not healthy. The coaches are very supportive. The app works in tandem with my fitbit. Make your own choices of what to eat and keep the food log in the app to track daily calorie totals. It's all here in the app, and if it wasn't for my low metabolism, the pounds would be flying off.",New feature,5,"This is amazing to read, Leslie! You are doing such a wonderful job embracing each aspect of the program! Keep up the awesome work!",
Suzanne Hendrickson,Functional,"I have been on the Noom program for 6 days. I have eaten very well and enjoying 3 meals and 3 snacks per day. I can eat whatever I want but your success will be based on what you eat. Noom controls your daily calorie intake which can increase by adding simple exercise programs ie walking and gardening. The cost is very reasonable compared to other weight loss programs. The communication between me and the guides has been very consistent. 3 lbs down, 19 to go!!ðŸ",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Congratulations on a fantastic start, Suzanne! It's great to hear that you're enjoying your meals and the guidance provided by Noom. Keep up the good work, and we're here to support you on your journey to your goal.",
Nancy L W,Functional,"The program itself is excellent. 20+ lbs lost. The one-on-one consults are well worth the price. The daily articles are cute at first; it makes you want to read them, but rereading it when it's not new is hard to stick with. The app needs tweaks, as does the food logging catalogue. Bookmarking articles you want to reread is easy, but with many bookmarks, articles are hard to find. The food catalogue needs reviewing because some of the same foods can be green or orange depending on which you pick",New feature,5,"Wow, Nancy!

Thank you for letting us be a part of your journey, and keep up the great work! ðŸŒž",
Carrie Barrios,Functional,"I am almost one month in. So far I've lost 10 lbs. For me, Noom works because I am accountable for my food choices in a way that is easy. The lessons are manageable to read and are logical. The app itself is very intuitive to navigate and visually pleasing. Though I haven't reached out to a coach yet, it's nice to know they are there if I need them. I love it!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We are so happy you're enjoying the accountability that Noom provides, Carrie, and those are some amazing results! Keep up the great work!",
Darcy DeAngelo,Functional,"This rating is two fold: weight loss program and user experience/interface. The program itself is pretty solid for someone who is motivated or needs help solidifying their motivation. At its core it is slowly provides you with the tools you need so as to not overwhelm you. Definitely worth the cost. The app is almost perfect. Some glitches here and there, and some aspects where I might want to see or have access to something.

Jack Forbes,Functional,"I tried Noom when it first came out but wasn't super motivated to do the program. It's since improved on the psychology to help answer ""why"". The app is a bit clunky (can't edit weight entries, can't view trends at your leisure, hard to navigate food logging) but the content is on point. I got all the bells and whistles this time so the exercise and meal planner have been helpful tools, as well as the new toolbox feature that offers 9 separate tactics to help keep you focused.",system requirement,5,"We're so happy to hear how much you've been enjoying your experience, Jack, and we thank you for your feedback on the app!

Benjamin Masse,Functional,"I was very skeptical about using a weight loss app and did my research on many. I landed on Noom and was really unsure about paying for the app. The 16 day free trial made me feel more comfortable. And results started coming right away. Easy to follow courses and guides, along with a simple calorie input system along with their green, yellow, and orange system helped me to better understand what, when, why, and how I was eating. One month in and I'm down 17 pounds.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Wow! That was wonderful to read, Benjamin! We're so happy to see you achieve your goals.

T S,Functional,"I've never followed a weight-loss program but have put on a few pounds that I haven't been able to shake, until now. Love the program itself. It's fun, smartly written and is working for me. The app is easy to follow and when I've had questions, support has been responsive. I have the app on my android phone and tablet and am glad to see that the UI is the same on both. The step count on my fitbit is registering on the Noom app, just not reflected on the home page.

Linda Cordes,Functional,"I have tried many diets in my life but always got to a place of boredom or plateau. Noon takes on a different approach of psychology and behavioral change. You can eat anything you want but this plan talks about healthy choices and portion control without guilt for occasional slip-ups. It takes time and patience but the weight loss continues its downward trend toward my goal. The object, I feel, is to be accountable for everything that goes into my mouth. I give the program an A+.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Wow, this was awesome to read, Linda! We are happy you're enjoying the accountability that Noom provides! Keep up the great work!",
Becky Kilpatrick,Functional,"It's a great way to set the mood for the day. Going through the lessons with morning coffee helps to remember your short term daily goals. Logging food is easy. Setting reminders help me. I travel, eat out, socialize and party, so limiting to no-carbs or certain foods is too restrictive for me. Noom helps me eat better, green food and limit the bad stuff. Also, not trying to be perfect everyday. Can't do it. I still struggle with my wine calories ðŸ˜©. But not giving it up. Just add to daily diet",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We're glad to hear that Noom has been a great way for you to set a positive mood for the day.

Nicole Copeland,Functional,"I like that the app is light (not overwhelming colors + the tone is a little comedic but informative). It is interactive, meaning there are questions to answer or quizzes to take. It provides a lot of knowledge about how our brains work when it comes to eating. I like that it can be joined with other apps like Fitbit or Google Fit (and more) to track your sleep/ steps/ exercise. There isn't a direct log out button, and the account tab doesn't give you the option to update your email.",New feature,5,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Nicole!

Barbara ONeil,Functional,"I find this weight loss program to be like none other. It is non- restrictive while guiding you to changing your behavior.

Teresa Trevino,Functional,Noom has been a great help to me in creating habits of making better food choices.

Nichole Squire,Functional,"The app is simple to use and breaks your daily calories down into three categories: green (eat plenty) yellow (eat moderately) and orange (eat in small doses). I like that it doesn't tell you to stop eating the things that you love. Instead, a focus on better decisions, moderation, and self care is highlighted. The only thing I don't like is that you get automated messages from ""Noom Coaches"" instead of an actual coach or person who checks in on you. That part can feel super impersonal!",New feature,5,"It's great to hear that Noom is helping you be more mindful of your eating habits, Nichole!

Nighel Cobb,Functional,"I loved nooms simple guide to weight loss, the calorie tracker worked well and helped me see my progress.

Jinjer Markley,Functional,"Love it. Great combination of useful information, good advice, moral support, data-based feedback loops, and meaningful rewards.

Nathan Franz,Functional,"Follow directions, see results. The nice thing about Noom is that is changing HOW I interact with food. It is changing my eating habits and I do not feel like I am missing anything. It is just teaching and helping me to make better eating decisions. I tried several others, Ideal Protein, NutriSystem, Etc. Dropped some weight but I hated it. Then I gained the weight back because they never taught me how to change behavior. Noom has. I am dropping about 10lbs per month.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Way to go, Nathan! It's great to hear that Noom has successfully transformed your relationship with food, teaching you to make better eating decisions and resulting in sustainable weight loss of around 10 lbs per month, unlike other programs that didn't address behavior change.",
D Kay,Functional,"Been doing Noom for 4 weeks and I love it. The app is easy to use, with no glitches. They give you recipe ideas. They Teach you all about foods and calories. Daily, short, motivational reads. It's very motivating. The first week I wasn't sure, but I lost enough weight to continue. Now it's been 4 weeks and I've lost 9lbs and I eat 6 times a day! Not all salads either! Noom is great for me!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,We love to hear that Noom has been able to help you learn how to eat healthier and smarter!

Jason Karels,Functional,"With the guidance from the Noom app, I have lost 40 lbs, and have been able to keep it off for the last several months. You can track what you eat, exercise, and water usage. The daily lessons are helpful to me as well. If you are looking for a quick fix, this isn't it. You will have to get that diabetes drug from your doctor or favorite ""shady pharmacist"". There are many add-ons (coaching, etc) available. I am not using them, personally. The basic app has been enough for me.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Congratulations on your incredible weight loss achievement and the ability to maintain it for several months, Jason! We're delighted that the Noom app has been instrumental in your success by providing guidance in tracking your meals, exercise, and water intake, along with helpful daily lessons. Keep up the great work!",
Ginger Henson,Functional,"Logging your meals every day, really helps you learn, recognize and change your portion sizes and eating habits. It teaches you about nutrition, green, yellow and orange foods and has great flavorful recipes. I wouldn't call it a diet because no foods are forbidden. It has great motivational tools and the more you exercise, the more calories you get to eat. It makes you look and feel great!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Thank you for this awesome feedback, Ginger! It's great to hear that Noom is helping you develop a better and more sustainable relationship with food. Keep up the great work building healthier habits!

Amanda McAllister,Functional,"Update : since the most recent update everything is working correctly. I like the changes that have been added such as listening to programs instead of just reading. Original: The concepts are great. I can see myself really changing how I think about eating. HOWEVER The app has been terrible. It crashes all the time. I was told to update, so I did. It got even worse. It's literally crashing my phone. I rated low because I can't even use it consistently because of the app failure.",system requirement,5,"Oh, no! We are so sorry to hear this has happened, Amanda, and we working to resolve this current crashing bug ASAP! Our Support Team would love to help. Do you mind reaching out to us at GPSreviews@noom.com so we can assist you?",
Holly Jean,Functional,"The app works pretty well. Every once I a while I see a typos in my courses, but I really appreciate the word play and humor in them. Tracking food is relatively easy, and you can track exercise. There are some exercises that are not on there, and once you add an exercise you can't remove it. Those would be my only problems. Other than that, it works well for losing weight or being healthy.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We're so happy that you're finding success with Noom! We also love that you're having fun and gaining tools to use towards creating a healthier lifestyle! Keep up the great work! We are sorry to hear about any issues you have had with the app. Our Support Team would love to help you and can be reached at GPSreviews@noom.com.

Enrique Pineda,Functional,"An extensive, ever-growing food database makes calorie-counting easy and convenient. The psychology-driven approach is a unique and, so far, effective means of helping _stick_ to new habits. Their goal is to help you maintain a healthy lifestyle for the long-term, instead of making weight loss a one-time goal. I'd like to see continued development of thr barcode scanning of foods, as it's rather hit-or-miss. This leaves manual data entry a bit of a chore if the food item is not found.",New feature,5,"Enrique, we are so happy to hear that the psychological approach the program takes has been so beneficial for you. Thank you so much for letting us be a part of this health and wellness journey with you.",
Michele Kolar,Functional,"This app is an integral part of my weight loss process. The app can be a little glitchy and it doesn't sync with Samsung smart watches (weird), but I have found a way around it. The app content is great. There are so many ways to monitor changing your habits and they aren't pushy about anything. You log your weight, food/ calories/meals and snacks, exercise, steps, heart rate and other things. It makes it interesting to spend 10 minutes a day seeing the trends (especially the weight loss).",system requirement,5,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Michele, and your honest feedback here is appreciated! We want Noom to be the best app we can make, and your feedback is invaluable to that process.",
S Ziems,Functional,"Pros: Really helps you to rethink how you view food. As well as finding those issues that sand bag your diet attempts. The group coach and chat are great for extra motivation and additional insights. Cons: They cut your calories much further than my doctor recommended. Their calorie count on a number of items is very off. They don't give you the ability to add personalized items. Finally, and this maybe my phone, the scanner doesn't always work. Overall I'd definitely recommend it.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,We understand how frustrating the issues with your scanner and calorie counts would be and extend our apologies for your experience. Our Support Team would love to help you and can be reached at GPSreviews@noom.com.,
Suzan Hughes-Kennedy,Functional,This app has helped me begin a much needed reboot in losing weight. It's different than the other apps I have used although it required a significant monetary investment. I'll update my review in 6 months but I have already lost 6 pounds in 3 weeks. I just did the update and hate the graphics and the text. Very hard to read. I liked the app a lot because of the graphics and colors. This is awful.,system requirement,5,"We love hearing that you're excited and already enjoying your program, Suzan! We hope your experience is excellent and if you ever need us we are always here to help!",
Alex Rattray,Functional,"Definitely an amazing place to start for building lifelong weight management skills and habits. I'm on track to meet my goals and I thank Noom for that. I've also learned a lot! The app itself is so-so (but don't use that as an excuse!): 1) The cutesy tone is a big turn off for me. They're ""researchers"" not ""nerds"". 2) The UX around calorie tracking is clunky, and since you do it many times a day the annoyances add up. I switched to ""Lose It!"", happily, and still use Noom for the lessons.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We are so happy to hear that you are staying on track to your goals, Alex! Keep up the amazing work!",
Trina Byrd,Functional,"Great tool for healthy eating. Focus is on changing habits to modify your relationship with food. At first, you won't see progress. I've started noticing that my choices have changed and I've been opting for better choices. Another thing I love about the program is that it allows you to eat what you want and doesn't classify food as bad or good. Simply foods you should eat less or more of. And it's conscious of us being human and very forgiving of slips. Losing weight steadily each week now.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Katrina, thank you for sharing this wonderful review, and congratulations on your progress! Keep on Noomin', you've got this!ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
",
A Google user,Functional,"Pro: This is the right app to buy if you didn't learn the basics of eating right when growing up. It will teach you the fundamentals of food from the ground up, in a way that really sticks. If you want to make a life-long change and live longer, this is a perfect spring-board for those who are starting from scratch. Take notes! Con: The starting calorie calculation is way too low for some; remember, you CAN adjust it! Also, the optional meal/exercise plans are NOT worth a penny. Skip them.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Sue Boughner,Functional,"I lost 50 pounds and have keeps it off for two years! The psychology was life-changing! It took more than the 5 mins a day advertised. That was just enough to get me hooked, but to actually do the work and lose the weight took more time, but sooooo worth it! There are a few minor tech issues, but overall really great app. There's a way to enter home recipes that is time consuming on the front end, but great once it's all in there. I have a BUNCH of personal faves stored. Anyway, I love NOOM!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Wow, Sue! This is such an amazing accomplishment, and we are truly honored to be a part of your journey! Thank you for sharing your experience, and keep up the great work!ðŸ¤©",
Mikiel,Functional,I was very skeptical before starting my Noom Journey. It's been almost 1 month and I'm down 20lbs. I don't even have to think about the calories anymore because Noom's database is so extensive that I just put it in and it adds it. The UI is very user friendly and easy to read. I love the weight graph and the calorie bar at the top of the screen. The daily tasks are also actually informative and helpful (though I disagree with some of their nutrition advice around protein). This is a great app.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,We love to hear that you're finding success with the program! Keep up the great work!,
Kate Rouse,Functional,"Nearly half way through, but after sticking to the daily lessons I have noticed major changes in my food choices, motivation and mood. It took a few weeks to see any difference on the scale, but sticking to the daily calorie allowance I have consistently lost a little weight each week, and am finding healthy foods that I look forward to eating. Don't expect overnight change, but I am really happy with the program so far!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,We're so proud to be a part of your daily routine! Consistency really is key - keep up the great work.,
Kori Lyn Price,Functional,"Game changer! I've been using this app for about 2 weeks now. It is exactly what I've needed to finally get it together and lose weight. It keeps you accountable, educational and the psychology aspect is phenomenal! Plus, a personal coach! One suggestion that would be awesome on the app is to add a journal section to our daily tasks. A place where we can take a moment at the end of each day to reflect on our goals, achievements, areas that need attention, what we've learned etc.",New feature,5,"Wow! That was wonderful to read, Kori! We're so excited to see you achieve your goals. Thank you for being part of the Noomily!",
Kelly Garon,Functional,"So far, my experience has been positive. The app itself is easy to use. It includes meal tracking, daily lessons, and a dietitian who all use CBT-based guidance to improve your relationship with food and your body. I have only lost a few pounds, but my choices in food have become healthier the more I challenge my thought distortions which keep me reaching for junk food more often than the good stuff. If you have thought you needed therapy to fix your food issues, this is a good place to start.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Me Ha,Functional,The app is great. You can log in food and calories so easily! You will get reminders that it is time to log in your meals.The articles are great and not so long that you lose interest. The personality in the articles are entertaining. The app will keep track of steps but is usually way off. There are recipes to explore. My coach doesn't contact me consistently so if that's your case ask for a different one?,FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We are so glad you are enjoying the App! Remember, you can always reach us at GPSreviews@noom.com if you need help with anything!",
Addie Anders,Functional,"It's only been 2 weeks but I am loving this program and app. It's easy to navigate, many helpful tools if you're truly trying to understand the why and how of your eating and wellness habits. The goal specialists and support are incredible and I'm making changes that are SUSTAINABLE, bit by bit. My only problem is that - unless your phone is on you every second, or you have a name-brand fitness watch, there is no way to keep up w steps without inputting them manually but I highly recommend!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Addie, we are so happy to hear how much you are enjoying Noom! Remember, you can always reach us at GPSreviews@noom.com if you need anything!",
Shelley Gabbard,Functional,"So far I love it! It's definitely changing my mind about alot of eating habits. Makes me more mindful of things way more often. I'd like to suggest being bale to change coaches... Not to sound mean, she's super nice! But at the beginning when asked what kind of ""coaching help"" I thought I needed... Turns out... I was WRONG! So it would be great to revisit that option and reevaluate, and actually switch it up for what I see (now) that I actually DO need.",New feature,5,"We're so inspired by your dedication to your wellness, Shelley!

Alyssa Franklin,Functional,"Overall, I'm losing weight and feeling better, so the app works if the entire program is followed. I definitely am shifting how I view food and although I HATED calorie counting, it is making me think about all the foods. The coaches are also help The app is missing a few things: a way to look up calories before logging, percentage of green/yellow/red on the chart, showing pounds lost vs only the trend line, BMI, and a place to record measurements. But I haven't found an app that does all this.",system requirement,5,"Weâ€™re so happy to hear that you are finding success with Noom, Alyssa! Thank you for the feedback regarding what can be improved within the app. Keep up the motivation!",
Libby S,Functional,"Second time through, with a year between. Comparison between the passes is a mixed bag: First time, I didn't know what to expect, and it was a surprise at every turn. I felt like I was making progress constantly. I stopped because I didn't understand how the system was setup - it appears to have 'open studio' after an initial teaching block. Second time: I've gained my 'COVID-19' and I need to address that. The curriculum is moving more quickly, which I appreciate.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Libby, we are so glad you're enjoying your journey with Noom! We're so happy to have you back in our Noomily! ðŸ˜Š",

Larisa Lynn Ortiz,Functional,"Loving this program! Feeling extremely hopeful. Enjoying the articles learning the ""why"" of many eating habits and helping me recognize the triggers. Only five days and already down 3.6 pounds. The app is very easy to navigate. Small suggestion: Will you please add Figure 8 to your exercise choices? I have started it and don't see it as an option. It's sort of Zumba combined with Latin ballroom dancing and toning techniques. Thanks. Keep up the great work!!",New feature,5,"We are so glad you're enjoying your journey with Noom, Larisa! We love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Remember, you can always reach us at GPSreviews@noom.com if you need anything!",
Dayneris Rodriguez,Functional,"Im a Noomliver! I was very skeptical at first. I tried other calorie counting apps but the results never lasted. Noom is very different; feels different. You are working your motivations behind your struggles, finding new ways to deal with them. You are also made responsible for your own journey & decisions in a way that without trying too hard you are losing weight. The science behind it is very good. The #s can be corny but the techniques are spot on. Ive already lost 4 pounds in first week!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Patricia Rajnish,Functional,"Having this program at my finger tips, literally because it is in my phone, is what I find immensely helpful. It is a reminder of my weight loss goal, and support and strategies from others is readily at hand. Keeping a food and exercise log is quick and simple. The foods are in the app, the exercise types are in the app, you just select what applies to you.Daily lessons are brief, helpful, and not overwhelming. You still have to put in the effort, but in this day and age of TECH, Noom delivers.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"This is amazing to read, Patricia! You are doing such a wonderful job embracing each aspect of the program! Keep up the awesome work!

Wendy Philyaw,Functional,"I LOVE NOOMing! Why did it take me so long to do this?! The app is user friendly, tracking is so easy that I actually find myself enjoying it, & no ads to bombard me! I love having a real live coach vs just automated replies. And most of all, this feels nothing like a diet whatsoever! I can take it at my own pace, set my own goals, and I'm learning a new lifestyle I can sustain! If you're on the fence, at least give yourself the gift of the free trial. You won't regret it!ðŸ˜Š",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Thank you so much for that glowing review and recommendation, Wendy! We are so happy that you are finding success with Noom and we wish more success to come!",
Heidi Reinhard,Functional,A year later as 2020 was a difficult time for us all so a refresher was the right choice for me. Noom's updated program with a new format is more streamlined. They cite their sources less frequently than the previous ( or maybe first timers run thru ?) This makes it less cluttered. But still includes motivational & psych tips that one tailors to their own life. It really is an individual plan because it's all in your head and your hands to make change. And the support is always great!,FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We're really glad to hear that you're enjoying our approach, Heidi! Thanks so much for coming back to Noom!",
Stella Arbelaez,Functional,"This is my 4th week using Noom. The articles have been informative and engaging. I was pleasantly surprised when the personal coach popped up and shortly after, a support group made of people who had started the program around the same time as I had. It is really nice to have a place to check in, let out thoughts and get feedback from people who are going thru the same issues. The graphics help visual peeps. My approach to weight loss is evolving, and that is awesome!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Kelley O'Neill,Functional,"I cant say enough good things about this app, and my overall experience with Noom. I've been using this program for just shy of a month, and I've lost 19 lbs already, most of which came off with diet changes alone, not much exercising done! This is completely different from other weight loss apps, in that it tackles the psychology of bad eating habits, and breaks those down, to develop good habits that can last a lifetime. I absolutely love this app and highly recommend it!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Way to go, #NoomNerd! We are so proud of your awesome progress, Kelley, and we're honored to be a part of your journey to lasting health.",
Katy Rogers,Functional,"Noom is by far the best weight loss strategy I've tried. The articles are extremely informative but kept funny and lighthearted and very easy to get through. Using the app is easy. I get a little frustrated with errors in the food library when tracking, but it's no worse than when I was using another app, and this app allows me to report errors immediately. I actually used Noom about a year ago and some things have changed for the better, including the ability to add your own recipes.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Martha Martha,Functional,"I haven't used any other weight loss app. This one is great because it helps change my thinking about food to change my habits. It tracks calories, exercise, weight, and has a built in step counter. I feel more in control of my food choices, thinner, and the scales showing the results too even after only using one week now. Update: after about a month and a half the scale is continuing to show the results of my efforts changing the way I think about food based on all the psychology tricks.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Martha, we are so pleased to hear you are enjoying Noom and seeing results!",
Casey McClain,Functional,"First app that I have stuck with for meal logging and health tracking for more than a month. Very easy to use, and focus on psychology and food intelligence makes weight loss much easier. I am able to make better decisions utilizing the knowledge I have rather than sticking to restrictive diets and exercise regimens. I am currently down 21 pounds in a 6 weeks. So it defintiely works as well and I haven't even made as many physical changes as I wanted to at this point.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"This is SO awesome, Casey! You are making phenomenal progress, and we are so grateful to be a part of your journey! Great work!",
A Google user,Functional,"Very easy-to-use color coded food groups make it easy to get started. Lots of support. It really makes you stop and think about eating and why you're eating what you are eating. You can have chats with coaches/guides and get immediate answers to your questions. Recipes, water tracking, and foods listed come with portions already available to choose from. Libraries to listen to past informational and motivational information always at your fingertips. Highly recommend.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,This is amazing to read! You are doing such a wonderful job embracing each aspect of the program! Keep up the awesome work!,
A Google user,Functional,"I've tried several other weight loss plans, I like this best, and it is working the best. It is based on sound science, has a fun and happy atmosphere, and is full of educational tips, feedback on one's food choices, support, and a gentle amount of accountability.

Pamela Delzeith,Functional,"It works !! I've been doing Noom for a month and have lost 8 pounds!! It's the only thing I could follow. Please know - I HATE vegetables, and guess what - I'm not eating any!! I've learned to eat smarter - moderation, a little exercise and focusing more on the fruits I like. This is SO simple. And the informational courses (a couple minutes each) are fun and positive. It's changing my mindset and I'm more aware of what to eat, but I've eaten everything I want to, including a little chocolate.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,,
Whitney Lockhart,Functional,"So far I find it very helpful. Even without a group I find being able to log my foods and keep an eye on the food categories extremely helpful at changing my lifestyle for the healthier. I like how the program focuses on whole life changes like getting more sleep, reducing stress, mindfulness and swapping better choices in for unhealthy ones. Nothing is ""off-limits"" but it focuses on small changes over time.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We're so happy that Noom can be part of your wellness journey, Whitney! Keep up the great work!",
A Google user,Functional,"Exceeds expectations Of course everyone's experience are different and I was just looking for something to give me tips on how to lose weight faster then my 1/2 lb/week. It increased my awareness of calorie intake and portion size in a refreshing, different way. It gave useful psych tips most people don't think of when losing weight. One main focus it aids in is food tracking. With a huge database of food/condiments/drinks/etc., I am able to quickly log my daily meals. Definitely a plus for me!",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We are so happy you're finding success with Noom, Maudi.  Keep up your amazing motivation!",
Diffy 1991,Functional,"It's early on still, but noom is very easy to use and figure out. With short easy lessons and clear tools and set up, it takes a lot of stress out of it. You still have to put in the work of watching what you eat and exercising, but it takes the guess work out and is very informative. EDIT: Noom may be pricier than other options, but if you put the work in and are consistent, it helps you create a healthier lifestyle, and not just a temporary diet that you fall off of.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Welcome to the Noomily! We are so honored to be a part of your journey, and we know you'll crush those goals! Keep up that dedication!ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª",
Jocelyn Swenson,Functional,"*Edit. After the issues i had signing up i got an automatic email from Noom. I clicked the link and it connected oitside the app and most of my answers had been retained. Since that point the app has worked very well. You might want to sign up on a computer and use the app after that. ""If the app can't handle a micro-second of interruption, or at least retain the answers I've already given, I'm not going to pay $179 with any confidence that I'll be able to access it when I need it.""",system requirement,5,"We're so glad that you're enjoying our program, Jocelyn, and we really appreciate your feedback regarding what you'd like to see improved.

Elizabeth Chamberlain,Functional,"I am very much enjoying the Noom experience. I love how lessons and introductions to the apps tools are broken down into bite-sized pieces. They also have the most inclusive and extensive food list I've ever used, as well as the ability to add your own items in. Love the colours and the graphics. I appreciate the ability to read and have it read to me. All the trackers in one place. Oh, and did I mention live coaches to ask questions and support? Wishing I signed up sooner.

Sandra Coulter,Functional,"I've tried Noom for the trial period off and on for a few years now. At first, I found it a bit goofy. But, over the years, the app has really improved. Also, I have come to appreciate the phychology behind this program. It's a good solid program. I would have purchased it much sooner, but I locked myself into a monthly subscription with WW I couldn't get out of. Yet another thing Noom is doing better. I appreciate the one and done annual payment (or you can choose other options).",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"That is what we love to hear, Sandra! Keep on Noominâ€™!",
Kristin Kostreva,Functional,I'm a few days into my trial and I'm pretty happy. I like how they incorporate articles to help you understand habits and triggers that make you a more mindful eater.

John Tucker,Functional,"I believe I will keep the lost weight off, as there is so much flexibility in losing weight. My preference is generally skipping breakfast (intermittent fasting) because I prefer saving for more substantial meals later, but equally it does accommodate those who prefer small meals with healthy snacks in between. And I can still have curry, cheese and peanuts, 3 of my weaknesses! I'm not finding the changes difficult and I'm not going hungry. The latter has sometimes been a theme on other diets",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"That's what we love to hear, John! Thanks for being a part of our community - we're always available at GPSreviews@noom.com if you need anything at all.",
Kim Kohler,Functional,Food tracking has been the easiest one of all the apps and other programs I tried following in the past. It's also more educational than judgemental . The coaches check in on you to see how you are doing and always reply in a timely fashion as promised. I've only been doing this for less than a week but I have already seen big changes in my habits and thinking. The little lessons make sense and are easy to follow.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Thank you for your kind words and we love to hear that you're finding success with the program already, Kim! Keep up the great work!",
Anna Kovalenko,Functional,"2nd time a charm! lots to love about the app. 1st time I bailed as paid version seemed expensive. however, as this was the only app with which I properly lost weight & improved habits, later during difficult post partum weight recovery, I bought the 4 month subscription. What I love: 1) their psychological approach is truly kind, sane, long term sustainable. Just complete the lectures! 2) food logging- simple and very flexible (helps cement habits), 3) syncing with e-scales & Fitbit: min effort",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We're so inspired by your dedication to your wellness, Anna!

Sharyn Unitt,Functional,"I will admit the first couple of days took some adjusting to, due to the constant need to log in daily intake (except for the odd rest day) but overall this app has been a fantastic tool to help keep myself accountable to the goals I want to achieve.

Douglas Kilmer,Functional,"This app works great; it, helps you to make the lifestyle changes required for permanent weight loss, teaches you the science of nutrition, teaches you how to make good food choices, and teaches you how to manage your weight before it bounces back and becomes out of control.

Rather than changing your time & schedule to conform to what the program needs, the program adapts to you. I started saying I could only commit 5 minutes a day to lessons but now doing double that. Weekly progress reports give you more than weight loss- it tells you how your diet has improved for other healthy inspo.

Thanks so much for taking the time to share your review and experience with us!",
Cheryl Richardson,Functional,"I like how the calorie count is calculated for each individual, and creates a losing zone that allows for more calories than most standard diets, so I'm not afraid of slowing my metabolism. I get quick help through the message support chat within the app. I'm surprised at how much the 5-8 minute readings help me just when I need them.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"This is amazing to read, Cheryl! You are doing such a wonderful job embracing each aspect of the program! Keep up the awesome work!",
Janette Matcham,Functional,"Noom is Excellent, informative and supportive. A journey of discovering how to have a better relationship with the food we eat and food choices we make. The emphasis is more on this rather than soley on the amount of weight loss, but it is working for me. I've lost 1 stone in the last month and starting to develop better habits with food and feel so much more in control of what I eat.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"That's exactly what we love to hear, Janette, and we're so excited to see you reach your goals. Amazing work so far!",
Kathy,Functional,Wonderful experience. I've always had trouble following and sticking to diets. This is easy to use and follow. Helps you to learn and change your ways of thinking.

I Just Believe!,Functional,"I was looking for a program that would teach me nutrition (i.e. healthy alternatives, etc.). I'd been playing with subscribing to Noom for about a year, until I finally decided to give it a try. I'm in my 7-day free trial period and I've already gained knowledge and an understanding of foods that I can have in abundance verses those I can still have but in moderation. I really like that Noom does not teach a restrictive lifestyle but a healthy balance. So far, I've lost four pounds.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,We love to hear that you've had so much success with Noom! Thanks for being a part of our community - keep up the great work.,
Brenda Ramstadius,Functional,very good app. Im doing the 2 week free trial first and it has been fantastic at kick starting me back on track.

Chris Brooks,Functional,"Winna winna chicken dinna. So i am soooo thankful that this site found me. Honestly, i wasn't looking for yet another ""diet loss"" program that would be an additional cost every month, then buying their products. But this is so different.

katsam2002,Functional,"Excellent program if you are looking for a plan that is long term. You have to commit to logging meals, daily weigh ins and reading daily lessons No food is off limits. Noom emphasizes enjoying food in moderation, eating balanced meals and steering away from good food/bad food concept. The program syncs with my fit bit. I use android and have not had any technical issues. I see Apple users commenting on the group chats that they experience technical difficulties with logging meals. I recommend.",system requirement,5,We're so happy to hear how much you've been enjoying your experience! Thanks so much for being a part of our Noomily!,
Jessica Visser,Functional,"I love Noom and its concept of changing habits into healthy habits for life. I've done restrictive dieting and as a nursing mother I knew that was certainly not the way to go. I feel like Noom is a healthy, realistic option that actually helps you lose weight and understand why you eat when and how much you eat. Also, it works. The UI is also great.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We are so inspired by your dedication to your wellness, Jessica! Thanks for letting us help you find your healthy balance!",
Denise Wood,Functional,"So far, so good. It has only been a week but I am down a little already. I like the lessons and the food tracker. I have only had to add a few things, most are already in.

(Can't carry phone at work)",system requirement,5,"Weâ€™re so happy to hear that you are finding success with Noom, Denise! Keep up the motivation!",
Susan Mccarthy,Functional,I've tried every diet over the past 40 years. Noom is the only one that has helped me to understand food and appreciate it rather than think it's my enemy. It has taught me to evaluate what I need for my body whilst tracking what I eat and make better decisions but also eating the foods I enjoy and having treats. I'd highly recommend giving it gobit certainly works for me .,FunctionalCapabilities,5,"We're so proud to be different, Susan! Thanks for making Noom a part of your success story.",
lauren Trezise,Functional,Incredibly supportive. Calories found and you can find portions in different weights. Lots of learning experiences and ways to modify your thinking. I found it very helpful.,FunctionalCapabilities,5,"That's what we love to hear, Lauren! Thanks for making Noom a part of your success story - and keep up the great motivation.",
Elizabeth B,Functional,"Easy to follow, helps me understand and change my eating patterns, rather than just focusing on eating less and feeling deprived. With Noom Med I learned that I have pre-diabetes and am insulin resistant, which was really driving a lot of my sugar cravings and binges. With that being treated it has been easier to focus on positive behavior changes",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Elizabeth, we're so pleased to learn that you're learning so much with the Noom Med program. Best of luck on your weight loss journey!",
C Armieri,Functional,"I had started it a couple of weeks ago, then I stopped after a couple of days. I stopped opening app in the morning. It helps having notifications pop up to remind you. The real trick is to keep opening the notifications and stick with the program. Don't give up. When you wake up, open your wake up notification and read in bed. Then start your day.",system requirement,5,"Great job sticking with your program - your dedication to your wellness is inspiring. C.! Remember, you can always reach us at GPSreviews@noom.com if you need anything in the future. Happy Noomin'!",

Hannelie Groenewald,Functional,"Nothing worked for me...until I discovered Noom. I'm not dieting. I'm eating mindfully and counting calories. I still mostly eat yellow and orange foods but within the boundaries set. And I'm losing weight...slowly, but constantly. I am convinced that I will reach my goal. I'm still in the trial period, and while Noom is really expensive, I consider buying it. Sometimes it is a bit annoying to log smaller amounts of food, since there are no units eg. 100ml. You have to log 1/2 cup.",New feature,5,"We're so proud to be a part of your success story, Hannelie, and we appreciate your feedback on the food logging! We're always available at GPSreviews@noom.com if you have additional thoughts to share.",
Victoria Savage,Functional,"Great support and guidance, healthy options for things you enjoy great encouragement to stay on track but to also indulge in your occasional treats without feeling guilty.

It really does work and for me, it has been life changing.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,We love to hear that you're finding such phenomenal success with the program! Keep up the great work!,
Deb Teikamata,Functional,Noom has got me back on track. I totally recommend it. One criticism is that it's USA based and when logging food you often have to break everything down.,New feature,5,"Weâ€™re glad that youâ€™re enjoying what Noom has to offer, Deb, and your honest feedback here is appreciated! We want Noom to be the best app we can make, and your feedback is invaluable to that process.",
Holly Wood,Functional,"Very helpful! I tried it before, and it seemed like a naggy mom. I got tired of it and quit. I really like the changes. It is more ""Game-a-fiedl and fun.

Cleo Dennis,Functional,"This app is easy to use. The instructions are very clear. I like ALL of it, especially that you can delete a food item that you choose but later decide differently. You delete anytime BEFORE ending the day. I like the thoughtful lessons you get. The one to three minute lengths are enough to keep you listening. If you're a reader you can read instead.

Keep it up because you are doing great!",
llagoons,Functional,"I find Noom to be very engaging. I'm a self-motivated person, so this program works well for me. I find the 1-3 minute courses to be educational.

I definitely recommend this program to anyone trying to become mindful about making healthier eating choices.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,We love to hear that Noom has made you more mindful of your eating habits! Keep up the awesome work building healthier habits with your Noom family!,
Abigail Rockett,Functional,"I am a nurse practitioner. I hate it, but it works. Noom puts the foods you choose to eat into three categories. It does make me mindful of my food choices. I also hate the psychological lessons, but they work too. I can't log certain activities like beach walking, but in the long run it really doesn't matter. It is a great program that is refreshingly not incentivised by pre made foods and supplements.",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Abigail! It's great to hear that Noom helps you stay mindful of your food choices and isn't tied to pre-made foods or supplements. Keep up the good work!",

Sandra Coulter,Functional,"I've tried Noom for the trial period off and on for a few years now. At first, I found it a bit goofy. But, over the years, the app has really improved. Also, I have come to appreciate the phychology behind this program. It's a good solid program. I would have purchased it much sooner, but I locked myself into a monthly subscription with WW I couldn't get out of. Yet another thing Noom is doing better. I appreciate the one and done annual payment (or you can choose other options).",FunctionalCapabilities,5,"That is what we love to hear, Sandra! Keep on Noominâ€™!",
Amanda Zimmerman,Functional,"My experience with Noom has been like no other..it feels like a best friend, encouraging me. I've lost 5 pounds in 5 days , something I wasn't able to do on my own.

In the morning, couldn't stop the sound, had to pause from the notification bar & then kill all running apps.

Omri Abram,Functional,I've been using the app with a yearly subscription for a couple months now. I generally like it but there are a few things that make me doubt I'll resubscibe if they aren't addressed: 1. I'd like to have many more lightly guided meditations longer than 10 minutes. A bit less talking! 2. I appreciate the use of soundscapes as background. But there are often audible and distracting clips when they loop on themselves. 3. The UI is quite poor and disorienting.,FunctionalCapabilities,3,"Hi there, I'm sorry to hear you are having the issues!

For example, if you turn off the screen to preserve battery, the instruction stops.

I set it to 30 minutes, but then couldn't get the app to shut up after I was done using it, even after force terminating.",system requirement,3,,
Stassja,Functional,"I would love to give this app a 5 stars. I actually can't sleep without it. The stories and meditation sounds are amazing. My main frustration is that I pay monthly for this service, and I can't repeat sleep stories. Sometimes, it takes me a while to fall asleep, and if the story ends before I do sleep, I have to lean over and restart. That's inconvenient and not fair. I should be able to repeat the story or create a playlist with my favorite ones with a timer to listen continuously. Please fix!",New feature,3,,

The Sleep Stories are wonderful, but when a story ends, there's no transition to another story. Without a continuous playlist or a timer, I have to pick up my device at the end of each story, get blinded by the light, and activate another story. Understandably, the light and the movement wake me up again. I wrote the company, and their response was a template thanking me for my ""thoughtful feedback."" The two longest stories are 45 minutes in length, but most run about 30-ish minutes, with others lasting 20, 19, 15, or even a mere 12 minutes. Those people who can consistently fall asleep in 12 minutes probably wouldn't need this feature. But what about the rest of us?

A Google user,Functional,"Calm is a great app for the category, but I'm not the type to subscribe to a service like this. theres just so many features I dont really need or want access too. it would be awesome if I could purchase individual meditations or sleep stories for like 99 cents instead of being forced into a 60 dollar yearly recurring fee. or even better if there was just a few more freebies included and rotated monthly in the free section I might understand better why it would be worth the money.",New feature,3,,
April Steed,Functional,"The interactions are intrusive and slow, and this app kills my battery faster than any app I've ever used. I've accidentally unplugged my phone while sleeping and missed alarms while it was running, all I'm doing is playing white noise that I've already downloaded. The content is mostly good but I'd never pay for this app, only using it because I got free from work.",system requirement,3,"Hi there, I'm sorry for the trouble! Reach out to support@calm.com and we'd be happy to help you out.",
Bryan Ceja,Functional,"Beginning not to like this app. The weekly ""sessions"" counter takes up over half the home screen and is the first screen you see whenmopeming the app. Yoi have to close it to get to the app. I don't need a sessions counter. I also don't need to know how many days I've used the app. You have to go through both of these screens before you can use the app. It's annoying. I just want to open the app and get to the home screen. I canceled my subscription because Calm is beginning to get annoying.",New feature,3,,
M Belanger,Functional,"The content is ok. I subscribed to the app for meditation, and I find the topics to be limited . Honestly, it's mostly just breathing in silence, followed by a very brief discussion on the topic of the meditation you select. It could be more guided and more directive. The stories are a neat feature, but I'm not that interested in them",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Andrew Mitchell,Functional,"Not enough free options. If there have to be advertisements, so be it, but I don't want to have to do a 7 day free trial, and then pay more than I already do (counselor, medication) for my mental health recovery. I'd be honored if the helpful meditations, stories, series, podcasts, documentaries, etc., were free (with ads if needs be, or a low annual fee), or as close to free as possible, and my cost could be reduced or eliminated by recruiting new members, or new contributors for teaching.",New feature,3,,

Ryan Siobhan-Israel,Functional,"I love the sleep music which I primarily downloaded it for. Overall, I do like the app for the different things to do. These days, I mostly use it to keep track of mindful tools. My only gripe is, I wish you'd stop moving the Mindful Tools tab off of or around on my homepage. I don't want to have to go search for it. Maybe you should have an option for us to decide what's on our homepage or not. (Update from 2019 review)",New feature,3,,
Paul Johns,Functional,"So I had a hard time finding a series I'd started to continue it, and was VERY frustrated. It's a big UI problem, but I was able to work around it. I had to search for the presenter's name then look at his content. There was actually a list for the series that was good. Even though I found it, it was a pain. But at least I can keep using the app. There really should be a link to it from my home page (since I'd started the series), from my recents page, and from every item in the series.",FunctionalCapabilities,3,,
Ryan Benty,Functional,"Generally good app and content. I think there is some work to do on the search and discovery side. For example, if I am searching for ""beginner"" meditation content, I would like to refine my search to courses only.

Leib Hershkowitz,Functional,"The mobile app is a blessing, but this one over here is halfway useless. Do you have in plan to fix the bugs and make this OS version more useful?

Marie Coste,Functional,"I have loved this app for years but the recent redesigns have made things so much harder to find. Calm needs to rethink the direction toward recommended, trending content and have this experience be more user friendly and user directed like it used to be. These redesigns have made things worse not improved. Trying to calm down and feeling like a target of constant sales pitches do not mix well. Please bring back the ability to browse categories and stop the recommended content.",New feature,3,,
Ash Cooper,Functional,"Strange Chromecast behavior.

Scott Pilgrim,Functional,"**Updating my review** I've been using the app for the last few month's and it's made a significant improvment on sleep. The meditations are excellent! However, the app constantly crashes. It usually happens when I first open the app but can be very disruptive when it happens during meditations. Has been happening for a while now and still hasn't been fixed. Very frustrating..",system requirement,3,,
A K,Functional,"Generally nice for relaxation, but when there is a voice or narrator you don't like and a huge number of the recordings are by the same people, it gets to be annoying (especially if the voice is NOT calming for you).",New feature,3,,
Becky Sanson,Functional,"I would give 5 stars, but I am only using what is free in the app, and there seems to only be one sleep story available. If I had access to everything on the app, it would definitely be 5 stars. I would gladly watch ads before using each story or pay a monthly fee. Hopefully they will find a compromise some day.",New feature,3,,
Katie Thomas,Functional,"Not keen on recent layout update. Kiddos has a hard time finding his stories not under a tab that says Kids, so navigation feels more difficult than it was before the layout changed. Otherwise, I love the calm app and my son and I use it nightly.",New feature,3,,
Whitney Reynolds,Functional,frustrated because recent updates make sleep stories harder to find. I used to be able to browse all of them or browse by narrator but now it seems to be nothing but algorithm.,New feature,3,,
Marissa Brigiotta,Functional,"I like the app's amount of content.

Patrick â€œThejaâ€,Functional,"I thought this would be a decent app to add to my meditation routine. Currently, I am not impressed with the offered content because it is overly commercialized. The meditations are either too short to induce a meditative state; or the narrators are speaking too much and not leaving enough quiet for the session to be beneficial. So far, I find the soundscape feature to be the highlight, but I hope that with continued use over the coming year, I can find the best way to utilize the app.",New feature,3,,
