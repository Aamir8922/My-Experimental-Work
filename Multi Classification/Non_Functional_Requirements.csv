James Ayube,Non_Functional,"I used to love this app, but the ads have become very obtrusive the last few months, so I'll be switching to another pedometer app. It's a shame they had to ruin the experience I undestand the need for apps on a free app, however I don't understand the need to have ads explode over the app when you open or when you try to exit. A more subtle ad makes it a lot more likely for me, at least, to look at at an ad, versus now it gives me a negative view of the product",Usability,1,"Hi James, sorry for the inconvenience.

Donna O'Connor,Non_Functional,This app is not reliable. It says I've walked 2 miles when it should only be Â¾mile. It tells me my average pace is 10 minute mile when I'm walking.

Sara Chapman,Non_Functional,I'd love this app... if it worked! It's been repeatedly recording activities and heart points and then a day or 2 later the points disappear. The activity is still there. This has been happening for years from what I've seen on troubleshooting boards and still no fix. The benefit of this app is it aggregates data across multiple platforms- it doesn't do anything special on its own. If it's corrupting the data then it's a totally useless app!!,Reliability,1,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,"It's a shame that this app gets updated so infrequently and each time Google manages to make it less functional. 1.0 was functional but not pretty. 2.0 was less useful and cartoony in design (some liked that, I did not). Now comes the 3rd major iteration and they managed to make it significantly less useful. It records my daily subway travel as walks. It's unclear if they deleted all my history, but only 1 month of data is visible now. The monthly view shows daily data over the past month - there's no way to see how you're doing this month compared to the last few months or the same month a year ago. The new heart points is useful, but since the data is so horridly wrong, I wouldn't trust it. With apps like Google Inbox going away, it's only a matter of time before Google axes this app too.. I guess I'll jump ship before final call.",Reliability,1,,
S D,Non_Functional,"Used to love this app, but it's become useless in the past few weeks. Heart points keep disappearing, data changes after being recorded, the journal never knows what day it is. For a few days some weeks ago, it wasn't showing any data at all. Eventually it came back, but it's been touch and go since then. Switched to Samsung Health, and it's been great.",Usability,1,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Summary: THIS THING IS NEARLY USELESS, FIND ANOTHER APP !!!  This review is for the new version of Fit that came out in fall 2018, in conjunction with the big update to WearOS. I tried using it with my Nexus 6P for simple tracking of the distance and time of my running routes. For this most basic use case, it just doesn't work, which is inexcusable. Hence the 1-star review.  2 critical pieces of functionality are ridiculously broken. First, when you're doing the activity (running, in my case) it usually computes your pace wrong. Sometimes it seems to include the time when you had paused the app (so the pace shows as way too slow), other times it seems to badly overestimate the distance (so the pace is way too fast). Second, even when the measurement is paused, it counts any distance that you move during the pause as part of the route. So what is the pause feature for?!?  The old version of Fit had a bad UI that encouraged user mistakes around pausing/restart, but besides that it worked at least for basic time+distance measurement. Now it can't do even that.  Other important things are broken as well, if contacted I'll be happy to explain them to a Google QA engineer.",Performance,1,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I liked the old version. It auto synced with my Walgreens apps. The old version was intuitive. It auto tracked vs. me having to remember to turn it on every time I wanted to record. It wasn't as accurate as needed but this is waayyy off. I'm not getting most of my data because I have the remember to turn it on. My weight isn't automatically received from my scale. There's no place to add notes about the day/exercise, etc. There's no place to track food. In an effort to make this simple, you've made it useless. Removing and looking for something better. Update 2/17/2020: Gave it another try with a different tracker -- FitPro. A much simpler tracker and still GoogleFit can't keep up! To add injury to insult my back up plan -- syncing my phone to my medical plan's app isn't working either. My AARP health plan gives me incentives to count my steps with a tracker or my phone! The app won't sync and I have a GOOGLE phone! What on Earth??? I give up. I really wanted this to work. I believe in tracking my steps and, in spite of a physical disability, I challenge myself to walk 10,000 steps or more every day no matter what. It's very rewarding on days when I'm really struggling to ""beat"" my own record but I have to have reliable data to know I'm doing that! This is discouraging. I really thought, by now, Google would have a better handle on this. I actually thought, they might even have their own device but for them to not be able to get their own phone to sync the app correctly with medical apps and devices that are partnering with Google is shameful! Oh well. I guess I can always try the old abacus and pray I don't fall in a hole while I'm walking with my service dog down the street trying to manipulate little beads on tension rods or (even worse) lose my count and have to start all over again! Hey, don't fault my humor! Blame their ineptitude!",Performance,1,,
Leslie P,Non_Functional,"No web access to data. Every ""improvement"" to the app makes it more weird, confusing, and less informative. It's fine as a hub that connects the other apps - because other apps are actually usable for the data. Google needs to make all of this content available on the web, then maybe ""google fit"" could be something other than a data synchronizer. Though...they get and can sell the data, so I guess whether we like the interface or not isn't really important to them.",Usability,1,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,"I would like to give this app 5 stars because it used to work just fine and I had no complaints. However, it hasn't tracked any distances since June 14th.

That's not at all accurate. Really hoping that Google can fix this.",Usability,1,,
Richard Edwards,Non_Functional,"It says it connects to my apps for my watch and scale, but the only thing it tracks is my steps. It sometimes displays my sleep, but never more than one night and then once it randomly tracks another night, it becomes the only one on record. It tracked my weight once, over a year ago, and not since. I was hoping for a place where my apps could all display my information in one place, but it definitely doesn't so that. I checked it was the updated and that permissions were set on all apps.",Usability,1,"Hi Richard. Thanks for taking the time to review Google Fit.

Oless Obushenko,Non_Functional,"The path tracking is all over the place. Sometimes it just cuts corners, other times it makes up routes fit for Spider-man. And this is while using the foreground recording functionality on a Pixel 4 XL, not exactly an obscure device with aggressive battery saving features. Edit: it worked for a bit as long as I did the recording(and ONLY the recording, no music controls) on my watch. Now, it's switched to not being able to acquire my phone gps, and randomly assigning 0 to distance.",Usability,1,"Hi there. Sorry to hear you're experiencing issues with activity tracking.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"Used to love it. Now it never loads the data unless I wait a long time. I waited a while and submitted feedback but it's been months with no fix and it's unfortunate because I used to like it but it's worthless now so I'm finally uninstalling it. Also, they count steps instead of minutes walking now and minutes was more intuitive for me. We should at least be able to choose the default because you could view steps before, just not on main screen.",Usability,1,,
Jared White,Non_Functional,"I've tried this twice. It doesn't keep an accurate count of my steps and my Google Maps started screwing up after I installed it, it kept not being able to pinpoint my location. This is the only change I made to my phone before that error started occurring. Well, it's stupid I can't respond to the developers response, so that's frustrating. Does this track steps or distance? If it's distance then that may be the issue. About half of my steps are taken going over the same areas again and again",Usability,1,"Hey Jared, you can try turning off and on all permissions for automatic tracking on your Google Fit app after restarting your phone.

Mindi,Non_Functional,This app is garbage. Doesn't sync with any of my devices that are connected to it. Only tracks through my phone and I refuse to carry my phone every second - especially when I'm exercising. It appears to be nothing but one more ploy to convince you to let Google track every inch that you move on this planet.

A Google user,Non_Functional,Such a trash app! It stopped working on May 26 and has not recorded a single bit of data and since it is connected to the Vitality Today app I have lost out on so many points! I have tried several things tonfix it and nothing works. On top of that the app doesn't sync with a Samsung watch so I always have to have my phone on me to get steps or workouts.,Usability,1,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,"This used to be a great app. The GUI redesign is awful, and the metrics are vague. I want to be able to look at a day or a week or a month and see total steps, miles, and calories. Currently it's broken down into chunks of activity thru the day with no total summary. I don't know or care about 'heart points'",Usability,1,"Hi Steve. Thanks for taking the time to provide feedback! We're sorry to hear that. We'll pass this along to the team, so they can continue iterating on your feedback to make Fit even better! Thanks again.",
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Update gave up lots of bits of polish, which is fine. But the first day of the week is forcibly Sunday instead of syncing with Calendar settings like it did before the overhaul, fitness tracking doesn't monitor elevation changes, insufficient customization for activities such as detailed logs for strength training, and plenty of other quirks that leave the app lackluster at the moment. Feedback within the app is completely useless and support doesn't address anything when contacted.",Usability,1,,
Christine Cunningham,Non_Functional,"Worked great until recently. No longer synching with my fitness devices regardless of all troubleshooting done. This is a known issue for many and Google has failed to correct it. Kinda pointless without being able to synch. Says it can't display devices. Honestly, don't waste your time till this known issue is actually corrected. *** As for the "" response and suggestion to uninstall and reinstall"" I have done that multiple times as well as disconnect and reconnect all devices. Didn't help",Usability,1,"Hi Christine, for a better Google Fit app experience, try reinstalling it and rebooting all your devices after. Also, make sure the location services and activity tracking permissions are both enabled. For more help, see this link and reach out through our support channels: https://bit.ly/3IKV4ZT",
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Not intuitive and does not show metrics that make sense. To see and compare activity from previous day/week/month, you have to hit the circle graph of today's ""goals"". The app will tell you how many miles you've gone, number of steps, and estimated calories burned, BUT ONLY on that day (ie at midnight, you can no longer see this info!). After the day is over, you can only see the ""heart points"" and ""movement-""whatevers you have done, and these two ""measurements"" are the only things you can set goals toward. While the idea behind these is okay, I still want a solid number that makes sense to compare and work toward, and it feels unfair to track the info that most fitness apps would track and then hide it/remove it/withhold it. It's nice, I suppose, to get more points for running than walking, and is a different metric than just steps, but the exact ""how"" this works is kindof a mystery. Literally: 1 point for every 30 steps/minute and ""more"" (two?) for ""more effort"". LOTS OF AIR QUOTES! Lots of made up metrics that may or may not make sense for you. As someone who walks a lot as part of my job and to commute, I just want to compare day to day to track what I've done. It doesn't work for me. If you need a reminder to get up and move, this app has nice notifications and a cute graph that i guess you could motivate yourself to do, knowing a run will get the goal met faster than walking, which might be motivating. It will also attempt to split off your runs/walks and show a quick map. So you can see at a glance how long that walk was in the AM vs PM. Of course, this gets truncated/partially deleted after the day is done. It attempts to split my day up into about a dozen separate ""walks"" and appeared to only save (the longest? The most point-making? Again, who knows!) three after the day was over.",Performance,1,,
Cynthia,Non_Functional,This is terrible at measuring the distance of my walk. I do the same path and it gives me a different readout every time. I don't understand how Google maps are incredibly accurate when I'm driving but not when I'm walking. I've read the suggestion to reset the app every day and that's not an acceptable solution. The only saving grace is getting heart points which are mildly motivating.,Usability,1,"Hey Cynthia, you can try turning off and on all permissions for automatic tracking on your Google Fit app after restarting your phone.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"I have an app for my scale that tracks weight, an app that tracks exercise, an app that tracks fasting, and an app that tracks my food. All of them do those specific things very well. However, not all of them can be linked together. The ONLY reason I was using Google Fit was so I could share the weight data amongst all of the apps, which it in theory, says it should be doing. Unfortunately, early October the weight stopped updating. Super frustrating.",Usability,2,,
Brandon Martin,Non_Functional,"No website to interact with your data in more granularity, which at 45 yrs old is a pain in the eyes. I don't want to stare at my phone 100% of the time, not when I could look at the data on a full sized screen occasionally. Also, occasional sync issues between my watch and my phone, as in my watch will track my ""heart points"" and steps to be ""x"", but then the phone will report one number correctly but not the other. The data is mostly there and mostly useful, but considering Google's power/ resources, this app is severely under powered. Very difficult to really interact with your data or dig down deeper into it. Which is dismaying. I have used it every day for the last 4-5 months and it gets the job done, but it has a certain simplistic feel to it that just feels amateurish. It's Google for goodness sake! They can do better. Even if it had a paid version so you could do all the fancy stuff to help people train better. It appears this is built for fat housewives and fat old retirees who need to be reminded that a nice leisurely walk isn't what the AHA was talking about when they recommended exercise. If you're somewhat athletically geeky and want to improve your training, this really isn't for you. Perhaps G is saving their advanced programming powers for the full integration of FitBit into their stable. That way they can charge more? Maybe. It WILL do the job...most days...and is certainly better than nothing. But, like many G initiatives, it seems like they didn't have a coherent plan nor enough follow through to provide the value that we all know they have the ability to. Hopefully it gets better one day.",Usability,3,,
Spring Shine,Non_Functional,Will be looking for a new app immediately. It used to be great but the forced active advertising ruins the experience. I didn't mind the passive ads.

A Google user,Non_Functional,I would love to sign up for the paid subscription but would rather do the one time $30 fee rather than the $9.99 a month.

Adiva Swinea,Non_Functional,"Didn't start it as soon as I subscribed and was beginning to think it was a waste of money but after 4 kids back to back (the last 3 being c sections and being 1.5 months postpartum), this was perfect. It wasn't strenuous on my abdomen. It got a little pump in my heart and some blood flowing aside from what the kids already do. I feel better already but it's only day one. The results will come with more consistency.",Performance,5,,

Ana Bratu,Non_Functional,This app does not allow unsubscribe process in an easy step. Will keep charging money. No emails will be communicating with the subscribers and sound like a fraud. 0 stars. Not reccomended.,Usability,5,,

Agreesh V S,Non_Functional,"Not a good application, there is no choice to cancel the subscription. They offer 299 per month, and I tried to subscribe that plan. And around 2999 rupees have been debited from my account. I think it was a monthly subscription. But it is a yearly subscription. They cheated on me. Didn't expected from the team. Too many calls, and no response for unsubscribe a plan. People in the call are looks like sleepy inthe conversation. I lost my money. Very poor from the team.

Raj S,Non_Functional,"I subscribed to one of their plans and now after 3 months when I try to cancel they said I have to pay the amount for entire duration. So, I am stuck paying Rs. 1700+ every month for services I don't want to use anymore. No one explained me the process upfront. So, if anyone wishes to subscribe, keep in mind you use the service or not, you have to pay the subscription fees. No other complaint, app and coaches are good!!",Usability,1,We abide by our T&Cs which are also visible on the application. We see that you're currently ineligible for a refund as per T&Cs of cancellation however we would be happy to extend other forms of exceptions if needed which has been communicated earlier. Do let us know and we shall be happy to take it up.,
Shilpi,Non_Functional,By no means am I a freeloader. I would definitely subscribe to an app if I like the service it provides but first I like to see if it's worth it or not. This app is so annoying. Within a minute of sign in the pop-ups for upgrade are crazy exhausting. You can't use one basic feature without getting a pop up. I'd suggest toning it down a little and letting people use some features first for a limited period of time or something,Reliability,1,"We apologize if you have found the frequency of pop-ups during your sign-in process to be annoying.

Either just leave without any refund for remaining or convert plan (why I need this if I want to leave) or pause indefinite (why I need If i coose to leave) Update- after connecting with support team only , I posted here.

Shashank Narayana,Non_Functional,Too many inhouse ads. It was having an amazing ui before. clean simple. But now.. too many offers will bombard you. If you want to track just calories.. they will ask to opt an offer in homepage. Then intermittent fasting offer. Then diabetes offer. Then talk to coach. Then unlock this section with an offer.. very bad UI. I know they have to make money out of it but should not spoil app experience and stop using the app than opting for an offer.,Reliability,1,"Hello Shashank, We appreciate your feedback and apologize for any inconvenience.

Vikrant Chauhan,Non_Functional,"While the calorie tracker is good, paid subscriptions are overpriced. You can confirm this overpricing by trying to look at there subscription costs where they first show you some amount for subscription and when you try to exit, they offer some discount of 31%. If there was a discount already then it should be shown clearly. You are looting the people who buy your service by showing overpriced costs and then reducing it and claiming it to be exclusive discount.",Accuracy,2,We appreciate your feedback regarding our subscription pricing.

sreerag ks,Non_Functional,External references to youtube videos in workout plan is not effective. And it's time consuming as we have to go through YouTube ads to see the the workout.

Brighton Joel,Non_Functional,This app's people seem to be too much money minded. There are subscription for almost every kind of feature and they are too costly.

Sagar G S,Non_Functional,"A holistic app whose idea seems great. I wish to upgrade to a premium plan but the lack of trial bothers me. A 12 month is too long a subscription to pay for without understanding the product. At the same time, a single month plan is comparitively very expensive.

But I am giving it only 3 star because of all the pop up adds. I understand you had a product to sell, ie, your dieticians etc. But some people just want to track their fitness.

Christopher Dennison,Non_Functional,"Yep, as soon as I put in my info, it wanted me to pay a monthly subscription. If you chose to decline, I logged you out, and you had to start all over again.

Paul Mayo,Non_Functional,"Use to be free Kinda crummy to have it be ""free"" then immediately demand a subscription. The inflation bit is a worn out excuse that I won't accept.

They claim I got an email reminding me this would happen, which I did not. And there are no charge reversals for auto-renewal. I will troll Noom and discourage every living soul I can from signing up if I do not get a refund for my second year, in full. I'll delete this if I do Edit to add: they responded to this review.

Tatiana Giacomini-Cowan,Non_Functional,"Absolutely furious, have not used the app in a while and it charged me a renewal of Â£129. No notification before renewal, no warning nothing.

Jason â€œNaviâ€,Non_Functional,"What a scam. They offer a 7-day trial that you have to pay for, then *they* choose how long of a subscription you get which screws you over on value if you have to extend (for example, they want me at 5 months for 174. 10-month would be 199, but extending to a second 5-month would be an additional 174 for 348 total.) Then they offer you about 5 different add-ons, *AND* they try to trick you into giving up your (supposedly ""all-features"") trial and starting the subscription immediately.

Lindsey,Non_Functional,"While they did help me to make some lifestyle changes that helped me to lose some weight, they charged me for a subscription renewal 5 months after my initial charge without ever making it clear it was a recurring charge or sending me a renewal notice.

Cameron,Non_Functional,"Terrible experience. The program was ok (though it is just a pricy calorie counter), but felt duped when they immediately charged a large lump sum (several hundred dollars) to prepay for months-long subscription. I was willing to pay, but the upfront charge for many months was not made clear. Despite their claims that they won't, they refunded and offered me a promo code.

Michael Smith,Non_Functional,"The app has ""dark patterns"" as soon as you sign up--designs which hide what is being offered and what you're paying for.

Chelsey Birch,Non_Functional,"Company is saying they are refunding fraudulent double charges. It has taken weeks to address this issue. Originally, they agreed to the refund of over $500.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"It seems like it would be helpful. However the notifications became overwhelming and unmanageable. The so called goal specialists are just automated responses, and do not help with you questions. Additionally, the advertised price showed monthly billing of $49. When my free trial ended and I was charged, two months of the subscription were billed to my account. I can understand that it's my job to cancel before the trial ended and would have accepted that I had to pay for one month. But it's not appropriate to charge me for two when I will not be using the ad, and did not know about the bi-monthly billing.

Bugs introduced recently: App doesn't start the day on today's date, so I have to go back and then forward to begin logging. Calorie counting display for the week no longer works. But the worst is that now every time I enter a food item, the app starts streaming a very loud ad; even with my volume turned off, the ad screams out of my phone's speaker. Annoying at work or at home with others asleep.",Performance,2,,
Mandi Kary,Non_Functional,"I haven't been using it very long, but I like the ease of scanning barcodes for my food. I hate that I can't make my own target calorie goal. I also can't sync my Google watch so if I want the app to consider my workouts, I have to manually try and enter it and that's super annoying. Use this app of you want a free app with a label scanner.",Usability,2,,
Alphax Anon,Non_Functional,"This is a slick, but slow app that's free crippleware. I love the interface and selection of foods. The calorie counts seem about right. But slowness OMG. On my Moto G6 it takes forever to load, and the main screen freezes for about 20-30 seconds while it gets itself ready, even when switching between apps. The usefulness of the free version is crippled, but there's no realistic preview of what we're missing. In this genre, the $39/year premium fee is not expensive but too laggy to pay for.",Performance,2,,
Nicole Copeny,Non_Functional,"It has a good setup, but it calculates calories wrong which is a big deal for a calorie counting app. It took me a minute to figure out why I would come up with different total calories when I would put in macros. The app calculates fats as 4 cal/gram and carbs as 9 cal/gram which is the exact opposite. That's a big mistake, one that really needs to be corrected. I had higher carb meals calculating crazy high calories and high fat meals super low. Hope this helps someone.",Accuracy,2,Sorry for the confusion here!

Barbara Ann Miller,Non_Functional,"The LoseIt app used to be great. Up until recently I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. Now I give it only 2 stars. There has been a challenge section on the app where people could sign up for & join weight loss, healthy eating, exercise challenges. These challenges were very motivational. Folks encouraged each other. LoseIt has now decided to discontinue the challenges! So many have voiced their objection to this but LoseIt just does not care. I discontinued my premium membership because of it.",Usability,2,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,"Tracks you and your information just like any other invasive app. Disappointing that you cannot use the barcode scan feature without giving the app full access to your files and media. This hasnt always been the case. Years ago, when I first used Lose It, it didnt require anything but the camera. I understand that you have to get paid, but dang... Just show a commercial based on workout gear or something. You wouldnt even need to collect user data for that.",Usability,2,,
Alicia Clark,Non_Functional,"I liked the free version of the app, so I paid the yearly subscription. I like the ease of use and it definitely helps me keep my macros in check.

Kevin Brosnahan,Non_Functional,"Been using this app for years with no problems. Then last week, they add really obtrusive and annoying video ads. Literally anything you do, there's an ad.

As I took screen shots of regular price, 25%, and 50% off. The all go to same price point. Other than that I love the app and was going to buy full version until I noticed the sale / non-sale.

Shawn Furniss,Non_Functional,"It works alright the first year using it I went from 290 to 190 in a year. However, the ads are insufferably obnoxious and ultimately counterproductive to what they are selling. It also makes the app a chore to use. You get an ad practically everytime you go to the main screen and lately it's been running extremely slowly at unpredictable times but an ad drops right away so I'm inclined to blame that. I would give this app 5 stars for the success that i have had with it, but the ads let it down.",Performance,2,,

Looking for another app to use now as almost everything in this app is accessed by payment. Too bad.,Usability,2,,
J Don,Non_Functional,"OK but dodgy promotion of premium and filled bad calories/macros so you must research outside the app to make sure you get the right ones. I started with a calorie budget of 1,650. It auto adjusts down as your lose weight. When your calories are under 1,500 it warns you that's too low. But you can't manually set it unless you buy premium. I was offered 51% off premium for 3 days. That expired. Then a day later I was offered 50% off. Pressure tactic, 50% off is the normal price, never pay more",Usability,2,,

A Google user,Non_Functional,"Was initially impressed with the accuracy. After 3 days of walking the same route, the numbers were of course different but, within reason. Now they are inexplicably all over the place. The very same route is calculated with as much as 1800 steps, 8 tenths of a mile in distance, and 20 minutes in time difference. I'm going looking for another app. This one is not accurate or reliable enough even if it is free.",Accuracy,2,,

Records between 50%-90% of the steps that Google fit records, which is impressive; seeing as the app is supposed to sync with Google fit, I'm not sure why it would have a different record.

I do like the achievements and levels offered, but they're pretty pointless if the number of steps in taking isn't recorded accurately.",Accuracy,2,"Hi Joel Down, sorry for the inconvenience, we fully understand your feelings.

Alice Maia Corso,Non_Functional,"The idea is great, and the realization it's a start, but I think the evaluation is a bit reductive. How much a food good is does not only depend on how much sugar or calories it gives. It's about the quality of the ingredients, the preservatives in it and also the its realization.

Brianna Schmidt,Non_Functional,"I briefly checked this app against various foods in my pantry and decided I won't be using it for inaccurate ratings. It marks down foods based on caloric count.

William Bailey,Non_Functional,I use the free version of this app and I understand there must be ads to support the work that goes into this useful app. What I don't like is being served ads (hello Carmax) that run longer than a major motion picture or ads in a foreign language (Facebook in Spanish) that will only close if you shut the app and restart it.

Mikaylah Cheyenne,Non_Functional,Just a few years ago everything or just about everything on this app was free to use.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"Just not what I was looking for. To be fair, I didn't give it enough time, but I found a couple of other apps for tracking keto specifically that impressed me more than this app. One thing in particular about this one was that it has a button or a gold key to unlock premium EVERYWHERE. It was just a little too cluttered with the focus of getting me to subscribe for me to put enough effort into trying the app. Sort of an ""over selling"" situation IMO.",Usability,,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,"This app is fine. I switched to this from MyFitnessPal a few months ago on a friend's suggestion. I loved their ""pattern"" recognition where it would notice I was more or less likely to go over or under calories with certain foods. However, they moved this behind a paywall. They also used to have more statistics and carb goals but then they moved those behind a paywall too. Almost every reason I was using this over MFP has been moved behind a paywall, and while I'd be happy to watch some ads or something to unlock features for the month that's not an option. I'm moving back to MFP because, while I think this is a better app for paid users I am not one. Now the free version is just a tracker with less features than MFP.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"I am quite disappointed in the Premium. The basic app is great and eaay to use for counting calories, adding exercise etc. The ads for Premium were very enticing, telling you tidbits about your habits and then saying upgrade to Premium to know more.

It's like whoever is in charge of updates is desperately trying to make it look like his job is needed. I don't think they've ever heard of ""don't fix what ain't broke"".

A Google user,Non_Functional,Nags you to buy premium every time you open it. Barcode scanning doesn't focus whatsoever. Need to get lucky to actually be able to scan something.

Muninn Featherpaw,Non_Functional,"I like this for calorie tracking, it's nice to have a visual on my intake.

A Google user,Non_Functional,Overall it's great my only complaint is that the ad space is too large and some of the exercises could use better explanations of how to do them. Mainly though I dislike that it only gives you tips occasionally. (Like when to breathe) sometimes it will give the tip halfway through the workout or not at all. Thats not as useful as it could be. Offer the voice tips with every exercise and five us the option to silence them completely. Other than that it's pretty good.,Usability,,,
Tortuga,Non_Functional,"Definitely good in that it is helping me work out more, but between exercises it sometimes stops and gives me the option to start the next exercise, which I like, but for stretches at the end it doesn't do this and I end up scrambling from cobra stretch to chest stretch (or I just ignore the app) as there is no time to get from floor to doorframe.

Matt Nicolls,Non_Functional,"Really wish I could give 5 stars but some really basic things make this app lacking. For one, the in app feedback goes to an email that is full so your email gets sent back. Second, the full body 7x4 challenge is actually just upper body and abs.

Also the app shows you more calories consumed if you take a break within a set which leads me to think it uses the time of set instead of no of reps to count the calories, which doesn't make sense because when the set is too hard, you want to take a break but still do the number of reps.

Several of the narrators have a style that many people must life, but I find really annoying (I don't find a really slow, exaggerated ""sleepy time voice"" to be calming). Biggest issue is that they do everything they can to trick you into a paid subscription.

Luckily I figured it out days ahead of time. If you don't unsubscribe more than 24 hours in advance they still charge you. Uninstalling doesn't make a difference. It's a shame. It seemed like a good app. I wish I had more time to play with it.,Usability,,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,"It's a nice app and I know it's helped many people based on reviews, but for me the subscription price is ridiculously high; there's a fair amount of free stuff but the music tracks I listened to for helping me sleep (unless I missed something) consisted of only 1 melody and not a running play list of several. Setting the sleep timer and hearing only 1 song repeat itself is monotonous.",Usability,,,
TomboyHeaven 5764,Non_Functional,"Really don't want to pay for the the subscription, you're very limited on what you can access and if anything, if they're trying to reduce stress, this way is obviously not the way to do it since people with high anxiety and depression don't want to look for 5 minutes to see what they can access without paying for the monthly subscription and find help after they're already past wanting it. Great app and all but, wish you didn't have to buy the subscription just for everything.",Usability,,,
Matt Deans,Non_Functional,"Well set up but not what I thought it was. Its nothing more than audio clips (some with soothing music behind them) of people telling you how to breath and relax, deal with anger/stress/etc. Literally just instructional audio clips. I immediately uninstalled it. If it sounds like its for you go for it, but know that there is nothing more to this app.",Performance,,,

The AI asks questions then makes a variety of determinations on what the cause could be. It does however show a disclaimer that the AI can be inaccurate at times and should not be taken as official medical advice, although this shouldn't discredit the app at all, it works well.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"I was really excited to try this, the charts and the promises of taking pictures would make life SO much easier; however most of it is in the premium, MyFitnessPal offers more free in my opinion and the ads are way less invasive...

Ya Boi Link,Non_Functional,"This app is excellent for tracking what you eat daily, especially if you have BED like me. I used to believe ""I wasn't eating much"" throughout the day at 250 lbs and counting 6 years ago. Tracking everything down to the ounce truly helped putting things in perspective! Now at 170 lbs, everything is in line and just habit. But! Now the app is ruined with huge unskippable pop-up ads. I get needing to make money, but really!? I don't want to use another app, but I'm contemplating it.",Performance,2,,
JB,Non_Functional,"Amazing app that has helped me lose weight and maintain it, but as of late I noticed ads started getting bigger, more obtrusive. I could ignore them. However, now I'm getting ads after every meal log and it's way too ridiculous to ignore. That will not make me want to pay for your premium services, only to delete the app despite using It for years.",Performance,2,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,"As all the other reviews say, the new update is not good for selecting quantities easily. It wasn't very good before though, as it didn't have the proper scale. Anyways, the free version is becoming unusable thanks to self promotional ads for premium. I get it, you guys need money, but you're ruining your brand and you're losing the respect of free users. You need to change something, and spamming free users with premium ads is only going to push away users that might one day pay for it.",Performance,2,,
Sarah FitzGerald,Non_Functional,"I used this app in college, was free then. I remember it being good. I liked that I didn't have to look up the calories for everything I was eating. After completing the intro quiz, they told me it was $35 a year. That comes $3 a month, which is not that bad. I just dislike that they weren't more upfront about it. I'll just Google how many calories are in a banana for now 🍌 🤷‍♀️",Usability,2,,
One B,Non_Functional,Almost everything requires a pro upgraded account now. Used LoseIt for a couple years and stopped in 2016 after an update.

Deleted and won't be back again.,Usability,2,,
CrazyWeeMonkey,Non_Functional,"While imperfect I've found this app (which has helped me lose like 20pounds so far), be very useful, though the UI is a bit clunky and dated in appearance. (Previous app performance issue was resolved) Edit: they doubled their pricing for the premium plan, I'm cancelling it. I can excuse $20/year but $40/year is quite the leap for an app that feels like a puzzle to use.",Performance,2,"Sorry to hear of the trouble!

Mo Sipila,Non_Functional,"I started using this app as an iPhone customer 3 years ago, and it was great. I had a premium subscription and used it a lot. But then I switched to Android before the end of the premium period and found that LoseIt premium wasn't anywhere near as useful on droid, and a lot of features were missing. Now I'm being badgered to upgrade to the now-useless premium every single time I try to log a food, and it's so relentless that I'm ready to delete the app and find another one.",Usability,2,"Thanks for your feedback on how the ads come across.

Kevin Brosnahan,Non_Functional,"Been using this app for years with no problems. Then last week, they add really obtrusive and annoying video ads. Literally anything you do, there's an ad. Hopefully they will reconsider this redesign, which is really annoying. I think they made it annoying on purpose to force you to get the paid version.",Usability,2,,
Scott Berger,Non_Functional,"I love the app but very disappointed in what seems false advertising sale price as $39.99 shows regular and on friends. As I took screen shots of regular price, 25%, and 50% off. The all go to same price point. Other than that I love the app and was going to buy full version until I noticed the sale / non-sale. Also, if it allowed me to pay monthly it would have been even better.",Accuracy,2,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,I would give this app five stars if it wasn't constantly harassing me to upgrade to premium. The app has a user friendly interface and is an efficient way of food journaling on the go. I love the fact that it can sync with Google Fit and apply my calories burned from my workout to my daily budget. The base form of the app meets my needs but the near constant pop ups urging me to switch to premium are obnoxious. I have no intention of ever getting premium.,Usability,2,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts on how the ads come across. Lose It!

A Google user,Non_Functional,I like most of the app. Workouts are great. It's user friendly. My largest complaint is the food database. ITS A MESS!! Too many people putting in incorrect information. I'm finding myself having to look up the nutrition of everything online which is taking away from its convenience. May not renew if this is not fix.,Accuracy,2,,
Kristopher Huff,Non_Functional,"If you think the often unskippable full screen ads are going to get me to buy a subscription you thought wrong. If anything it will make me use a different app. I won't give this app 1 star, it helped me lose over 100 pounds.

Jason Mckimpson,Non_Functional,"App is slow and clunky now, didn't used to be. Was supposed to be the replacement for MyFitnessPal but at this point it might be worth it to just pay them instead. Ads after EVERY entry, ridiculous!",Performance,2,,
J Don,Non_Functional,"OK but dodgy promotion of premium and filled bad calories/macros so you must research outside the app to make sure you get the right ones. I started with a calorie budget of 1,650. It auto adjusts down as your lose weight. When your calories are under 1,500 it warns you that's too low. But you can't manually set it unless you buy premium. I was offered 51% off premium for 3 days. That expired. Then a day later I was offered 50% off. Pressure tactic, 50% off is the normal price, never pay more",Usability,2,,
Anahi Hernandez,Non_Functional,I like the app pretty good however it would be nice to have a setting where I can change the date of what I've logged. So many times I'll log the past days food on the current day and then I have to delete it all and redo it on the prior day. Other than that very user friendly. Also mime often plays music when I try to log stuff sometimes,Usability,2,,
Andrew Evans,Non_Functional,Nice app...when it doesn't keep crashing. Constantly taking way too long to add food because it keeps stalling out every ten seconds. Other than that it is a nice app. If you want to spend half an hour adding food then go for it.,Reliability,2,,
peter mansour,Non_Functional,"This app is absolutely infuriating. While the app itself is fantastic, I don't know who the product manager is who decided it it's best to spend half an hour asking the user questions that may not pertain to them. I don't think I've ever come across a poor decision in software development. I wish I could recommend this to my friends and family because the app itself is great but I wouldn't put them through this pain.",Usability,2,,
Laurel McConnell,Non_Functional,It was a good app until they started allowing ads to interrupt everything and force you to watch the ad before you can use the app again. I'm uninstalling it.,Usability,2,,
G Skuzx,Non_Functional,"Update: What's up with the annoying background music? Turn it off! it's definitely one of the better apps, however I would like a way to just manually input the maximum and minimum amount of calories that I'm aiming for per day, and then just have a be happy with that number. In other words it will be red if it goes outside of that range. and it would be cool to have the ability to only show dinner for somebody such as myself who's on an intermittent fast for 19 hours per day.",Usability,2,,

After the recent update Oct 2018, it now comes up with option to enter number for servings or amount of items, instead of being able to scroll through numbers. I hate the new update, i don't want the number pad to come up every time i select a food item, i would rather scroll like it was before. why change something that was just fine like it was.

A Google user,Non_Functional,"Just not what I was looking for. To be fair, I didn't give it enough time, but I found a couple of other apps for tracking keto specifically that impressed me more than this app. One thing in particular about this one was that it has a button or a gold key to unlock premium EVERYWHERE. It was just a little too cluttered with the focus of getting me to subscribe for me to put enough effort into trying the app. Sort of an ""over selling"" situation IMO.",Usability,3,,
A Google user,Non_Functional,"This app is fine. I switched to this from MyFitnessPal a few months ago on a friend's suggestion. I loved their ""pattern"" recognition where it would notice I was more or less likely to go over or under calories with certain foods. However, they moved this behind a paywall. They also used to have more statistics and carb goals but then they moved those behind a paywall too. Almost every reason I was using this over MFP has been moved behind a paywall, and while I'd be happy to watch some ads or something to unlock features for the month that's not an option. I'm moving back to MFP because, while I think this is a better app for paid users I am not one. Now the free version is just a tracker with less features than MFP. Good app, stable, great pay features but too hollow as a free tracker.",Usability,3,,
Mark Thomason,Non_Functional,"Basic version is about useless. If you want people to try your premium product give them a free trail THEN give them the option to upgrade. That is not what this app does. It gives you the basic version which pretty much only tracks calories and if you want more features you have to pay $40 for a year. Yes, it is a trail but how many people remember to discontinue their free trail after the 7 days is up? Very few. That is the business model here.

Becci Marin,Non_Functional,"This does what I need, which is track my calories, so it's good in that sense. I don't like that you have to toggle ""done"" every night for it to count in your tracking.

A Google user,Non_Functional,IT's not a bad little app but it constantly bugs you to upgrade to the pay version.  A lot of home cooked items are not in the database.  For many items there are pages and pages of the same thing with a serving size of 1 but no mention of how big that serving size is.  You can edit a recipe but you can only add and remove items you cannot adjust the quantity/size.,Usability,3,"Sorry for the trouble with this!

Brian Chadwick,Non_Functional,I have used this app for several years. I recently stopped paying for premium. I like the app but it's too glitchy to spend money on it.

Noah Beck,Non_Functional,"Mediocre in every way. The UI is good and I like the idea of having fasting tracking in the app, however... One of the most important features of any food diary is the ability to manually edit your calorie and macro targets. This app puts those behind a paywall.

If you're looking for the next serious food tracker after MFP made their app unusable then look elsewhere.",Performance,3,,
Christy Hudley,Non_Functional,"Just ok. Upgraded to premium and synced the Fitbit. My main gripe has more to do with the exercise not syncing up immediately and reducing the total caloric intake for the day.

A Google user,Non_Functional,Not a bad app but not the best. What I really need is to see how many macros I actually have left without having to click on them individually. That would be extremely helpful. I see what they did with displaying them when you click in them but I'd love to he able to open my log and see how much more of each that I need to eat.

In 6 weeks I've lost nearly a stone, but I wasn't really aiming to lose just tone so that's great news for me. Now the bad bits, the workouts are not labelled very well.

A Google user,Non_Functional,Overall it's great my only complaint is that the ad space is too large and some of the exercises could use better explanations of how to do them. Mainly though I dislike that it only gives you tips occasionally. (Like when to breathe) sometimes it will give the tip halfway through the workout or not at all. Thats not as useful as it could be.

Callum K,Non_Functional,"It's an amazing app, but I have to knock off a star, the app asks what your fitness level is before you begin, and how many push ups you can manage. I entered 30. The first days workout wanted nearly 90, that's far too many for someone to push themselves through, use the app as a guide, but if you start losing form during an exercise, stop and move on to the next. There's also no reminder for rest days, the daily notifications are great for encouragement; but they should include days for rest",Accuracy,4,,

It seems the data unavailable for common products was unintended and the developer was able to resolve in short order.

AJ 95,Non_Functional,"I like this app. Citations for the additives is brilliant and the app works flawlessly so far. My only reason for 4/5 stars is how additives, salt, fat and sugar are weighted.

The bait and switch technique is really a deplorable tactic so don't be fooled, they will do whatever they need to to convert you to a membership.

Vianka Jauregui,Non_Functional,"The variety and organization of workouts is really convenient. The articles can be fun to read, but a lot of them can be misleading and fail to sight any credible sources. The articles about metabolism and targeting fat are particularly problematic. That doesn't mean you won't get results! It's a great app that encourages people to get moving in a way they enjoy. Just take the advice with a grain of salt and keep making progress.",Accuracy,4,,
Sara Morgan,Non_Functional,"The premise is amazing, not only are there options for all, but instructors & videos are of outstanding quality! I rate 3.5 bc I can only view ""for you"" section on my phone but not my computer where I actually use the app preventing me from seeing my favorites. Additionally, I wish there were a way to organize my favorites into my own categories to easily get to what I'm looking for instead of scrolling through a single disorganized row. I beg you to make that change for all users!",Usability,4,,
smallfry 34,Non_Functional,"This app is just AMAZING! So far I have done a yoga session and two warm up sessions and I love it! I am only giving 4 stars because you have to pay to see the recipes of the meals/snacks/drinks, which sucks because I love trying new foods and cooking. Edit: and you can't disable the chat. There is an incognito setting but it doesn't work really well. Other than that amazing job developers!

Ruchi Bansal,Non_Functional,"FitOm has been the perfect workout buddy in this pandemic, so much so that I get anxious on days I don't end up working out! But I really like their holistic approach. There is something for everyone here! One thing I would change is the layout of the app since it can get confusing navigating it. What seems to be my workout settings are actually my account settings and vice versa. I would also like them to improve the browse page.Basically, it needs to be more user friendly. But I love this app!",Usability,4,,

Breanna Green,Non_Functional,This app is actually awesome! I've tried a lot of exercise apps that I didn't like due to ads or the poor quality of the workout. The workouts on here are great and I'm always sore the next day even though they are 20-30 minutes. This app would be PERFECT if only I could mute the background music in the videos and play my own,Usability,4,,
Yvonne Eele,Non_Functional,I love this app. I would like it better with one small change. I prefer to watch a workout all the way through before doing it. If there was a way to watch a video in preview mode (but seeing entire video) that would be great. Right now it feels like I'm cheating because the app thinks I worked out to a video that I was just checking out.,Usability,4,,
Tamara Francuski,Non_Functional,"App is quite good, workouts can be really challenging if you are not cheating. But there is one minus for meal recipes- I found on quite a few recipes that is missing some ingredients, such as toppings or dressing. It says in process of preparation to mix all the ingredients for dressing, but doesn't say what are the ingredients. So, it's either you have to improvise or change the meal.",Accuracy,4,,
B P,Non_Functional,"Love it, the workouts are great. There isn't a great deal of meals for the vegan section though and also with the meals it doesn't say all of the ingredients in the ingredient list but then in the directions they will add an ingredient. So if somebody wants to follow it directly they will have to guess how much of one ingredient. I love the challenges in the app, they always keep me focused on the workouts and the progress pics can be added too.",Usability,4,,
Claire Grant,Non_Functional,"Love this app. So much variety from stretching to weights workouts, as well as different trainers to choose from too. There are no add interruptions which is fantastic.

I wish the nutrition area had more resources, but you have to pay for them, even with the pro version.

Christy Hemphill,Non_Functional,"I've used this app almost daily for over a year now, and logged over 650 workouts. I am not typically evangelistic about or all that loyal to any products, but I rave about FitOn to anyone looking for a fitness app. I used to use workout DVDs, but it gets old doing the same routines over and over and expensive to buy new ones and find they aren't really favorites. This app gives almost limitless possibilities for mixing it up and never getting bored. I love being able to switch things up between all the different kinds of workouts. I have exercised regularly for 20+ years and I find the advanced modifications on the level 2 and 3 workouts to be plenty challenging and allow for progression in my fitness level. Over the past year, I've lowered my body fat percentage and gotten noticeably stronger and more flexible. The trainers are very professional and promote safe workouts that don't result in strains and injury. The only thing I wish was that there were better (and longer) dance workouts with decent music tracks. I have to go back to my DVDs to get good Zumba/Bollywood/HipHop dance workouts.",Usability,5,,
